                "text": "Athletic Bilbao manager Marcelino Garcia is looking forward to overcoming heavyweights Barcelona in the final of the Spanish Super Cup after side pulled off a shocking 2-1 victory over defending champions Real Madrid in the semi-final on Thursday.  Raul Garcia scored twice in the first half, the second a penalty, and while Karim Benzema pulled one back for the defending champions, Bilbao held on to complete a statement win under their new coach Marcelino Garcia Toral. Bilbao were beaten 3-2 by Barca in La Liga only last week, with Lionel Messi scoring twice at San Mames, yet they will get another shot at Ronald Koeman\u2019s side this weekend, with a trophy up for grabs in Seville. \u201cWe are 90 minutes from winning a title,\u201d said Marcelino. \u201cIt would be amazing, and even better to do it beating Real Madrid and Barcelona.\u201d Real coach Zinedine Zidane was defiant in defeat. \u201cIt is not a failure,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can\u2019t win every game.\u201d Messi is touch and go to be fit for the final, after missing Wednesday\u2019s penalty shoot-out victory over Real Sociedad with a muscle problem, although even without their captain, Barcelona will be strong favourites. Related: Koeman lauds Ter Stegen as Barcelona reach Spanish Super Cup final Bilbao, though, should take huge confidence from an excellent performance at La Rosaleda in what was only their second game under Marcelino, who replaced the sacked Gaizka Garitano earlier this month. They were also up against a Madrid team that had been unbeaten since December 1, even if a chaotic weekend caused by the heavy snowstorm in Spain might have had lasting effects on players\u2019 minds and bodies. Zidane insisted he was not making excuses on Saturday when he criticised the state of the snow-dusted pitch following the goalless draw at Osasuna. Cancelled flights meant Madrid\u2019s players were unable to leave Pamplona until Monday, forced to fly straight to Malaga without returning home. But even Zidane admitted on Wednesday that four days preparation was enough and there was little to suggest concern from his line-up given it was his full-strength team, the same core of players that has driven their resurgence since October. \u2018Start was difficult\u2019\u201cOur start to the game was difficult,\u201d said Zidane afterwards. \u201cThe first half was not good. They had two chances and scored two goals. In the second part we changed the picture, we improved and created chances.\u201d Raul Garcia was sent off after 13 minutes when Real Madrid beat Bilbao in the league last month but this time he had two goals in the first half, each coming after a mistake by Lucas Vazquez. First, Vazquez gave the ball away cheaply, allowing Raul Garcia to finish past Courtois and then Madrid\u2019s full-back dragged Inigo Martinez down at the back post after letting him sneak in behind him. Raul Garcia drove the penalty into the top corner and Bilbao might have been three up had Iker Muniain finished off a flowing move by heading in, instead of wide of the post. Madrid were better after the interval, with Marco Asensio lively. He hit the post from an Eden Hazard pull-back and then the crossbar with a swerving shot from distance. The pressure told when Fede Valderde\u2019s cross was nodded back for Benzema to tap in, leaving Madrid with just over 10 minutes to find an equaliser.

                "text": "The Spanish League of American Football, LNFA, watched as first the snow and then the pandemic halted three of four games scheduled for this weekend. \nA heavy snowfall hit the Madrid area of Spain late last week and although the snow is now melting, two of the home teams this week \u2013 Osos Rivas and the Las Rozas Black Demons \u2013 have been unable to practice so the decision was made to postpone the two games until a later date. \nOsos Rivas was scheduled to host the Fuengirola Potros while the Black Demons were set to play host to the Gijon Mariners. \nThe third game between the home team Badalona Dracs and the Murcia Cobras was also postponed due to travel concerns related to the COVID-19 pandemic. \nThe fourth game of the weekend between the home team Mallorca Voltors and the Zaragoza Hurricanes will be played Sunday, January 17 at 12 noon. \nZaragoza Hurricanes (0-1) @ Mallorca Voltors (1-0), Sunday, January 17\n \nThe Hurricanes are coming off a lopsided 51-8 loss to the Badalona Dracs while Mallorca earned a solid 33-7 win over the Murcia Cobras to start the season. \nThese two teams met twice in 2019 with the Voltors winning both, 14-7 and 45-8. \nMallorca looks to be even more improved over last year\u2019s squad with the addition of quarterback Tanner Young and receiver Jaylon Hibbs, who for the third time, are playing on the same team. They started as a deadly combination for Centre College and took their combined talents to Australia\u2019s UNSW Raiders in 2019. Now they continue their saga with Mallorca. In the season opener, Hibbs caught seven passes for 94 yards and a touchdown while Young tossed three touchdown passes in total the other two to Juan Carlos Castilla and Javier Alberola. Running back Christian \u201cPiti\u201d Mir scored two rushing touchdowns as the Voltors took a 26-0 first half lead. \nThe Voltors have also bolstered their defense with the addition of all star linebacker Kadel King, fresh from winning the Finnish championship with the Kuopio Steelers. \nZaragoza enters this game with running back Denzel Duchenne hopefully healthy again and possibly also a new quarterback. With Andrew Vital who scored the Hurricanes lone touchdown against Badalona, still in the lineup Zaragoza could surprise. \nWatch the game live on American Football International. \nThe post Spain: Mallorca Voltors set to host Zaragoza Hurricanes; 3 games postponed appeared first on American Football International.",

                "text": "https://ift.tt/eA8V8JAthletic Bilbao manager Marcelino Garcia is looking forward to overcoming heavyweights Barcelona in the final of the Spanish Super Cup after side pulled off a shocking 2-1 victory over defending champions Real Madrid in the semi-final on Thursday.  Raul Garcia scored twice in the first half, the second a penalty, and while Karim Benzema pulled one back for the defending champions, Bilbao held on to complete a statement win under their new coach Marcelino Garcia Toral. Bilbao were beaten 3-2 by Barca in La Liga only last week, with Lionel Messi scoring twice at San Mames, yet they will get another shot at Ronald Koeman\u2019s side this weekend, with a trophy up for grabs in Seville. \u201cWe are 90 minutes from winning a title,\u201d said Marcelino. \u201cIt would be amazing, and even better to do it beating Real Madrid and Barcelona.\u201d Real coach Zinedine Zidane was defiant in defeat. \u201cIt is not a failure,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can\u2019t win every game.\u201d Messi is touch and go to be fit for the final, after missing Wednesday\u2019s penalty shoot-out victory over Real Sociedad with a muscle problem, although even without their captain, Barcelona will be strong favourites. Related: Koeman lauds Ter Stegen as Barcelona reach Spanish Super Cup final Bilbao, though, should take huge confidence from an excellent performance at La Rosaleda in what was only their second game under Marcelino, who replaced the sacked Gaizka Garitano earlier this month. They were also up against a Madrid team that had been unbeaten since December 1, even if a chaotic weekend caused by the heavy snowstorm in Spain might have had lasting effects on players\u2019 minds and bodies. Zidane insisted he was not making excuses on Saturday when he criticised the state of the snow-dusted pitch following the goalless draw at Osasuna. Cancelled flights meant Madrid\u2019s players were unable to leave Pamplona until Monday, forced to fly straight to Malaga without returning home. But even Zidane admitted on Wednesday that four days preparation was enough and there was little to suggest concern from his line-up given it was his full-strength team, the same core of players that has driven their resurgence since October. \u2018Start was difficult\u2019\u201cOur start to the game was difficult,\u201d said Zidane afterwards. \u201cThe first half was not good. They had two chances and scored two goals. In the second part we changed the picture, we improved and created chances.\u201d Raul Garcia was sent off after 13 minutes when Real Madrid beat Bilbao in the league last month but this time he had two goals in the first half, each coming after a mistake by Lucas Vazquez. First, Vazquez gave the ball away cheaply, allowing Raul Garcia to finish past Courtois and then Madrid\u2019s full-back dragged Inigo Martinez down at the back post after letting him sneak in behind him. Raul Garcia drove the penalty into the top corner and Bilbao might have been three up had Iker Muniain finished off a flowing move by heading in, instead of wide of the post. Madrid were better after the interval, with Marco Asensio lively. He hit the post from an Eden Hazard pull-back and then the crossbar with a swerving shot from distance. The pressure told when Fede Valderde\u2019s cross was nodded back for Benzema to tap in, leaving Madrid with just over 10 minutes to find an equaliser. Benzema thought he had it but the flag was up for offside before Sergio Ramos headed wide and Vinicius Junior curled over in a frantic late surge that Bilbao survived.

                "text": "Athletic Bilbao manager Marcelino Garcia is looking forward to overcoming heavyweights Barcelona in the final of the Spanish Super Cup after side pulled off a shocking 2-1 victory over defending champions Real Madrid in the semi-final on Thursday. \n\t \n\n\n\nRaul Garcia scored twice in the first half, the second a penalty, and while Karim Benzema pulled one back for the defending champions, Bilbao held on to complete a statement win under their new coach Marcelino Garcia Toral. \n\n\n\nBilbao were beaten 3-2 by Barca in La Liga only last week, with Lionel Messi scoring twice at San Mames, yet they will get another shot at Ronald Koeman\u2019s side this weekend, with a trophy up for grabs in Seville.  \n\n\n\n\u201cWe are 90 minutes from winning a title,\u201d said Marcelino. \u201cIt would be amazing, and even better to do it beating Real Madrid and Barcelona.\u201d \n\n\n\nReal coach Zinedine Zidane was defiant in defeat. \n\n\n\n\u201cIt is not a failure,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can\u2019t win every game.\u201d \n\n\n\nMessi is touch and go to be fit for the final, after missing Wednesday\u2019s penalty shoot-out victory over Real Sociedad with a muscle problem, although even without their captain, Barcelona will be strong favourites.  \n\n\n\nRelated: Koeman lauds Ter Stegen as Barcelona reach Spanish Super Cup final \n\n\n\nBilbao, though, should take huge confidence from an excellent performance at La Rosaleda in what was only their second game under Marcelino, who replaced the sacked Gaizka Garitano earlier this month.  \n\n\n\nThey were also up against a Madrid team that had been unbeaten since December 1, even if a chaotic weekend caused by the heavy snowstorm in Spain might have had lasting effects on players\u2019 minds and bodies.  \n\n\n\nZidane insisted he was not making excuses on Saturday when he criticised the state of the snow-dusted pitch following the goalless draw at Osasuna.   \n\n\n\nCancelled flights meant Madrid\u2019s players were unable to leave Pamplona until Monday, forced to fly straight to Malaga without returning home.  \n\n\n\nBut even Zidane admitted on Wednesday that four days preparation was enough and there was little to suggest concern from his line-up given it was his full-strength team, the same core of players that has driven their resurgence since October.  \n\n\n\n\u2018Start was difficult\u2019\n\n\n\n\u201cOur start to the game was difficult,\u201d said Zidane afterwards. \u201cThe first half was not good. They had two chances and scored two goals. In the second part we changed the picture, we improved and created chances.\u201d \n\n\n\nRaul Garcia was sent off after 13 minutes when Real Madrid beat Bilbao in the league last month but this time he had two goals in the first half, each coming after a mistake by Lucas Vazquez.  \n\n\n\nFirst, Vazquez gave the ball away cheaply, allowing Raul Garcia to finish past Courtois and then Madrid\u2019s full-back dragged Inigo Martinez down at the back post after letting him sneak in behind him. \n\n\n\nRaul Garcia drove the penalty into the top corner and Bilbao might have been three up had Iker Muniain finished off a flowing move by heading in, instead of wide of the post. \n\n\n\nMadrid were better after the interval, with Marco Asensio lively. He hit the post from an Eden Hazard pull-back and then the crossbar with a swerving shot from distance.  \n\n\n\nThe pressure told when Fede Valderde\u2019s cross was nodded back for Benzema to tap in, leaving Madrid with just over 10 minutes to find an equaliser.  \n\n\n\nBenzema thought he had it but the flag was up for offside before Sergio Ramos headed wide and Vinicius Junior curled over in a frantic late surge that Bilbao survived. \n\n\n\nFollow Samaa Sports on\u00a0Facebook\u00a0and\u00a0Twitter",

They had two chances and scored two goals. In the second part we changed the picture, we improved and created chances.\u201d \nRaul Garcia was sent off after 13 minutes when Real Madrid beat Bilbao in the league last month but this time he had two goals in the first half, each coming after a mistake by Lucas Vazquez.\u00a0 \nFirst, Vazquez gave the ball away cheaply, allowing Raul Garcia to finish past Courtois and then Madrid\u2019s full-back dragged Inigo Martinez down at the back post after letting him sneak in behind him. \nRaul Garcia drove the penalty into the top corner and Bilbao might have been three up had Iker Muniain finished off a flowing move by heading in, instead of wide of the post. \nMadrid were better after the interval, with Marco Asensio lively. He hit the post from an Eden Hazard pull-back and then the crossbar with a swerving shot from distance.\u00a0 \nPromoted \nThe pressure told when Fede Valderde\u2019s cross was nodded back for Benzema to tap in, leaving Madrid with just over 10 minutes to find an equaliser.\u00a0 \nBenzema thought he had it but the flag was up for offside before Sergio Ramos headed wide and Vinicius Junior curled over in a frantic late surge that Bilbao survived. \n                         \n                         \n\n                                Topics mentioned in this article  \n                         \n \n Source link  \nThe post Athletic Bilbao To Face Barcelona In Super Cup Final After Ousting Real Madrid | Football News appeared first on neesnews.",

                "text": "Related news\n\nAn important member of the government of Madrid that bus lines provide great clues to diagnosis.  If they are blocked, public transport does not circulate, but neither do delivery men.  In other words: as long as the EMT map illustrates the collapse, supermarkets will run the risk of shortages and it will be difficult to attend schools or health centers. \nAt the end of this Thursday, when a storm was about to be completed, they were only active 39 of 185 lines daytime buses, which is barely 21%.  The damage to economic activity is already close to 1,400 million euros, at a rate of 200 a day. \nThey work the Metro and commuter trains with almost absolute normality, but these routes do not alleviate the difficulties of large or small businesses.  Neither those of the Post Office.  They have not even been able to begin to collect the remains of 150,000 trees affected by the snowfall. \nThe opposition has already called for the resignation of Borja Caravante (PP), councilor responsible for the Environment and Mobility.  His performance, according to the sources contrasted by this newspaper, has also sowed concern in the city government itself. \nMore Madrid He accuses him of lack of foresight and \u201cirresponsible behavior\u201d.  Late on Friday afternoon, the city buses continued to circulate despite the heavy snowfall.  Dozens of vehicles were trapped.  At first, the drivers were ordered to return to the garages, but the mandate was rescinded shortly after. \nThe mobility crisis that Madrid is suffering \u2013 classified as \u201ccatastrophic\u201d by opposition councilors, but also by the Executive itself \u2013 has led the mayor to predict that schools will not be able to reopen on Monday, January 18, as planned . \nThe municipal sources consulted by this newspaper mention a \u201clack of coordination\u201d between the UME \u2013 Ministry of Defense \u2013 and the area directed by Carabante, which is slowing down the speed of recovery. \nMayor, Jos\u00e9 Luis Mart\u00ednez-Almeida, asks the Madrile\u00f1os \u201ccaution, care and caution\u201d due to the obvious \u201crisk\u201d.  7,230 people are already working to abort the storm crisis.  At the moment, according to official data, only 1,784 streets are \u201ccleared\u201d out of a total of -approximately- 9,000. \nThe blockade on the street has also led to the accumulation of 9,000 tons of garbage.  The City Council indicates that 100% of the collection trucks have already returned to work, but for several days the city will not recover, in that sense, normality. \nThe architecture of Madrid\nAnother of the main problems that Filomena has brought in the field of mobility has to do with the accumulated snow in the rooftops and cornices.  Throughout these days, there have been small avalanches that have caused human and material accidents. \nThe president of Official College of Architects of Madrid (COAM), Sigfrido Herr\u00e1ez, points out in an interview with this newspaper that \u201cclearly we were not prepared\u201d for a volume of snow like the one that has fallen. \nNo matter new neighborhoods than old ones.  \u201cI do not think it depends on modernity or the width of the avenues,\u201d says the president of COAM.  \u201cUrban planning has a hard time influencing meteorological issues;  that is to say, the type of snow fall only has one prevention, which is removed as soon as possible and when it is still soft \u201d, he says. \nUnfortunately, Herr\u00e1ez points out, in Spain there is no generalized culture, as in the Nordic countries, of picking up the shovel and removing the snow as soon as possible. \nHowever, the problems in the buildings associated with the storm Filomena have two aspects, according to Sigfrido Herr\u00e1ez.  On the one hand, the maintenance over the years.  \u201cI invite the communities of owners to look slowly if there are any cracks, loose cops and check the clearance of the railings so that, if they see failures, they call an expert or a professional,\u201d he warns. \nThe president of the COAM especially affects all the elements that are put on an architecture project (cornices, railings or roof cops, air conditioners, porches) and that have special danger.  Snow and low temperatures can cause the water to freeze inside a hole in a facade, break the mortar or brick that holds it and these elements can come loose. \nHe also points out that \u201con the terraces of some premises the one who sizes is a metal carpenter and he has fallen short\u201d.  \u201cIt is very difficult for a project controlled by an engineer to happen that,\u201d but it happens in these elements where \u201cthere are many people who calculate by eye,\u201d laments Herr\u00e1ez. \nIn this sense, highlights the president of the COAM, \u201cit is very important to avoid these errors what Madrid did with the ITE (Technical Inspection of Buildings) that buildings have to pass periodically\u201d. \nOn the other hand, Siegfried Herr\u00e1ez points to possible human failures.  \u201cMaybe some technician has made a mistake in calculating the oversizing for snow, wind, water issues;  Nor should we think that all problems are caused by a snowfall \u201d, he acknowledges. \nHence, perhaps the Current Building Code, which is just over a decade old.  This is a standard approved by the Ministry of Transport, Mobility and Urban Agenda, and that \u201cit is worth rereading and adapting to the new situation.\u201d  If these snowfalls arrive more frequently, it would only be necessary to update it to secure more the structures of the buildings. \n \n \nReference-www.elespanol.com \nThe post Filomena, day 7: mobility is still blocked at 79% in Madrid, which loses 200 million a day appeared first on The Canadian .",

Bilbao were beaten 3-2 by Barca in La Liga only last week, with Lionel Messi scoring twice at San Mames, yet they will get another shot at Ronald Koeman\u2019s side this weekend, with a trophy up for grabs in Seville.\u00a0 Messi is touch and go to be fit for the final, after missing Wednesday\u2019s penalty shoot-out victory over Real Sociedad with a muscle problem, although even without their captain, Barcelona will be strong favourites.\u00a0 Bilbao, though, should take huge confidence from an excellent performance at La Rosaleda in what was only their second game under Marcelino, who replaced the sacked Gaizka Garitano earlier this month.\u00a0 They were also up against a Madrid team that had been unbeaten since December 1, even if a chaotic weekend caused by the heavy snowstorm in Spain might have had lasting effects on players\u2019 minds and bodies.\u00a0 Zinedine Zidane insisted he was not making excuses on Saturday when he criticised the state of the snow-dusted pitch following the goalless draw at Osasuna.\u00a0 Thibaut Courtois blasted La Liga for treating the team like \u201cpuppets\u201d by refusing to postpone the fixture.\u00a0 Cancelled flights meant Madrid\u2019s players were unable to leave Pamplona until Monday, forced to fly straight to Malaga without returning home.\u00a0 But even Zidane admitted on Wednesday that four days preparation was enough and there was little to suggest concern from his line-up given it was his full-strength team, the same core of players that has driven their resurgence since October.\u00a0 Raul Garcia was sent off after 13 minutes when Real Madrid beat Bilbao in the league last month but this time he had two goals in the first half, each coming after a mistake by Lucas Vazquez.\u00a0 First, Vazquez gave the ball away cheaply, allowing Raul Garcia to finish past Courtois and then Madrid\u2019s full-back dragged Inigo Martinez down at the back post after letting him sneak in behind him. Raul Garcia drove the penalty into the top corner and Bilbao might have been three up had Iker Muniain finished off a flowing move by heading in, instead of wide of the post. Madrid were better after the interval, with Marco Asensio lively. He hit the post from an Eden Hazard pull-back and then the crossbar with a swerving shot from distance.\u00a0 The pressure told when Fede Valderde\u2019s cross was nodded back for Benzema to tap in, leaving Madrid with just over 10 minutes to find an equaliser.\u00a0 Benzema thought he had it but the flag was up for offside before Sergio Ramos headed wide and Vinicius Junior curled over in a frantic late surge that Bilbao survived.   from World Soccer Talk https://ift.tt/3bCs7lr",

                "text": "Hello lovely ladies,\u00a0It's Friday Smiles again and time to look back at the smiles of our week, the silver lining and all that was positive.\u00a0My first smile is my postcard. I received it from Germany earlier this week, when I received 6 other cards, all from Germany. (There must have been a mail train from Germany or a flight, as they all arrived together.)This is something we all wish we could do: bathe in the sea in the sun. These ladies in their daring bathing costumes certainly seem to be enjoying it.\u00a0 The info on the back gives us a date: 1925, and the place: Muritz on the Ostsee.This is what it looks like now:The stamps are beautiful. The large one on the right I have featured before.\u00a0  The\u00a0Dessau-W\u00f6rlitz Garden Realm, (German:\u00a0Dessau-W\u00f6rlitzer Gartenreich) is a\u00a0World Heritage Site\u00a0in Germany, that lies between city of\u00a0Dessau\u00a0and the town of\u00a0W\u00f6rlitz\u00a0in\u00a0Central Germany. It was designated world heritage in 2000.\u00a0It is one of the first and largest\u00a0English parks\u00a0in\u00a0Germany\u00a0and continental\u00a0Europe. It was created in the late 18th century under the regency of\u00a0Duke Leopold III of Anhalt-Dessau\u00a0(1740-1817), returning from a\u00a0Grand Tour\u00a0to Italy, the Netherlands, England, France and Switzerland he had undertaken together with his friend architect\u00a0Friedrich Wilhelm von Erdmannsdorff. Strongly influenced by the ideals of\u00a0The Enlightenment, they aimed to move on from the\u00a0formal garden\u00a0concept of the\u00a0Baroque\u00a0era in favour of a naturalistic landscape as they had seen at\u00a0Stourhead\u00a0Gardens and\u00a0Ermenonville. Today the\u00a0cultural landscape\u00a0of Dessau-W\u00f6rlitz encompasses an area of 142\u00a0km2\u00a0(55\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) within the\u00a0Middle Elbe Biosphere Reserve\u00a0in the German state of\u00a0Saxony-Anhalt. Let me show you the collages of my week. I never did a collage on Friday, but Saturday was a lovely day. I smiled because of the sun, and because we had pancakes for breakfast, a real treat. Also I started a new book. Tess Gerritsen (A Dutch name, but she is American of Chinese descent) The Sinner. It is a medical thriller. In real life the author is a surgeon, so all the medical stuff rings very true. I couldn't\u00a0put it down!  I read my book in little over 24 hours and have started The Surgeon by the same author. Exciting stuff! When we went shopping on Monday, there were a lot of empty shelves and i was getting worried, until I realized that there had been heavy snowfall in Madrid and central Spain over the weekend. The news mentioned blocked roads and lorries stuck in the snow. So I suppose that is the reason for the lack of supply. On Tuesday we went out for lunch at our favorite restaurant, and then spent the night at our weekend home nearby.My sister, who also lives in Spain, is a golfer. When they have bad weather, she doesn't know what to do with herself. They did a jigsaw and loved it, so then I found another puzzle that I had double and I sent it to her.   Yesterday I made Dutch pea soup in my Instant Pot. I have my own recipe. I just put all the ingredients together in the Instant Pot and I guestimated 20 minutes of pressure, and it turned out perfect! (Recipe further down)   That was my week dear ladies. How about yours?\u00a0I'm going to join Annie at A Stitch In Time and Virginia at Rocking Your Week Friday.\u00a0Of course as per usual, there will be some funnies at the end.Well my dears, stay safe and take care,Keep smiling,Hugs,Lisca      The following one is a Chrismassy one that got forgotten: (Please sing out loud)    The translation of the below Spanish text is: Please check that it is not someone from your group. This is not really a funnie. I just like these benches:",

The storm, named Filomena, brought the heaviest snowfall Madrid has seen in almost 50 years, dropping more than a foot and a half of snow on the city and surrounding areas. \n\n\n\n\n\nOn Thursday, city hall officials warned that it would take several more days to clear all the roads, the task slowed by freezing weather conditions that are predicted to last until the middle of next week. Spain\u2019s weather office forecast on Thursday that this 10-day period of freezing temperatures would be the longest stretch of such weather to hit Madrid in two decades. \n\n\n\n\n\nMadrid\u2019s airport was closed for most of the weekend and only resumed its normal flights schedule on Thursday, while schools and sports centers are set to remain closed until Monday. \nThe snowfall also destroyed parks around the capital, with damage recorded for 11,000 of the 17,000 trees in Retiro Park, according to local authorities. \nMore than 700 soldiers have been sent to help city services clear the snow in Madrid and the neighboring region of Castilla-La Mancha. Despite their efforts, 127 roads remained fully closed to traffic on Thursday. \nThe storm brought Madrid to a standstill, disrupting transport across the country, just as Spain was entering its third wave of the coronavirus pandemic. On Wednesday, Spain\u2019s health ministry recorded its highest number of new cases since the pandemic hit Spain last March. The country\u2019s Covid-19 death toll, more than 53,000, is one of the highest in Europe. \n\n\n\n\n\nThe snow also interrupted the country\u2019s vaccination campaign, which started in late December. In Madrid, many health care workers were forced to work extra shifts to cover for colleagues who could not reach their hospitals because of the snow and ice.",

                "text": "Record cold temperatures have hit parts of Europe and Asia causing electricity prices to spike as the normal generating supplies of electricity could not keep prices in check. Spain registered its coldest temperature on record, at -35.6 degrees Celsius, and several areas of the country, including Madrid, are under 18 inches or more of snow and may get record-breaking snowfalls. The electricity price in Spain soared to nearly \u20ac95 ($116) per megawatt hour\u2014up 123 percent from prices the previous week and nearly three times higher than the 2020 average. Frigid temperatures, as low as -10 degrees Celsius, are gripping much of Japan and electricity prices jumped to record highs of 222.30 yen ($2.13) per kilowatt hour. (For comparison, average electricity prices in the United States in October 2020 were 10.64 cents per kilowatt hour.) \nEurope \nThe surge in Spain\u2019s electricity prices results in an increase of 27 percent in the average user\u2019s electricity bill. Factors that have driven up the costs to heat and power households include reduced output of renewable energy from the cold and stormy weather and the evolution of the natural gas market at a global level, which recently sustained a price shock. As a result, Spain has dipped into its subterranean natural gas reserves, which is 80 percent full. \nIn Germany, day-ahead power prices hit the highest level in two years with temperatures in Berlin dropping close to freezing; prices could increase further with temperatures expected to dip as low as minus 6.9 degrees Celsius by Sunday (January 17) in the German capital. Residential electricity prices in Germany are already 3 times the average cost in the United States owing to their rapid adoption and subsidization of renewable wind and solar energy. \nSource: MSN\nA sub-zero blast is expected to worsen conditions in Europe with a weather phenomenon known as a sudden stratospheric warming. The event can disrupt the polar vortex, the winds that usually keep cold air contained in the far north, and allow freezing weather to head south. The calm conditions associated with it are expected to stifle Europe\u2019s wind generation, causing dependence on its thermal energy. \nCold conditions in Europe are expected between January 17 and 22 that will push the number of heating degree days for that period 11 percent above the 10-year average. The cold spell is expected to last at least a week and possibly into the start of February. The cold arctic air flow has led to a surge in power demand and has lowered gas storage levels sending prices to the highest in two years. When margins tighten and renewable output is low, more expensive-to-operate thermal plants are needed to increase supply, which pushes up prices on the day-ahead and intraday power markets. The market is also exposed to risks of price spikes when units are unexpectedly turned off, forcing system operators to activate reserve power plants or ask industry to cut consumption to keep the grid stable. \nFrance usually exports excess power from its nuclear units to neighboring countries, but scheduled nuclear plant maintenance is adding to the power supply shortages and to the strain from the cold. France also has a much higher level of electric heating than most other European nations, making its own electric demand more sensitive to cold weather. \nFrench nuclear generation is below the five-year average \nSource: MSN\nAsia \nChina recorded temperatures of -16 degrees Celsius on January 7 in Beijing\u2014the lowest since 1967 as a cold wave is sweeping through areas of China. The cold weather and a manufacturing boom are expected to result in record electricity demand this winter. An historic peak load came as extreme cold weather increased demand for electricity-powered heating facilities, which account for 48.2 percent of total load. Natural gas demand also surged in northern parts of China, where gas is now a dominant heating fuel for more than 20 million homes, with prices touching multi-year highs last month despite the country importing record levels of LNG cargoes. \nThe cold wave also snagged transportation in the north, adding more pressure on the overwhelmed logistics system, and ice stalled many vessels at port. Qinhuangdao port, one of the largest coal transporting hubs, recorded the biggest number of vessels waiting in anchorage on Thursday since September 2018 due to the harsh weather. As a result, China is prioritizing shipments of coal on its state railroads. The ice could also affect offshore oil and gas production in China. \nSource: Reuters\nJapan\u2019s gripping temperatures had its utilities calling on the public to save power as electricity generators resorted to using fuel oil, instead of coal, to meet surging demand for heating. They also asked industrial users to help supply the grid. The country\u2019s utilities are also trying to source more LNG, where they are competing with China. Electric Power Development (J-Power), which mainly runs coal and hydro plants, is switching a coal power station to only fuel oil. Frigid weather across north Asia has caught utilities and LNG importers off guard as the demand for electricity reduced fuel inventories. \nThe cold weather along with other issues has resulted in an unprecedented shortage of liquefied natural gas tankers, making them the most expensive ships to ferry commodities. Spot rates have more than tripled in the past month, with BP Plc last week paying $350,000 a day to charter an LNG tanker to pick up a cargo from the United States. The previous high for a commodity carrier occurred in late 2019 when a crude supertanker was booked for daily earnings of $308,000. \nSource: Bloomberg\nThe factors affecting the LNG shipping market are the robust Asian spot gas demand due to the cold winter, record-high exports from U.S. projects and delays to traverse the Panama Canal, causing vessels to take longer routes to Asia, increasing transport time and significantly curbing the amount of available vessels in the Atlantic. Spot LNG tanker rates in the Atlantic basin increased to a record $322,500 a day on January 8\u2014up $99,000 from January 5. The Pacific spot tanker rates increased to $221,750 a day. \nConclusion \nExtremely cold weather has hit parts of Europe and Asia, setting record temperature lows in some areas and spiking electricity prices. In Europe, output from renewable energy is down due to the cold weather and snow storms, resulting in thermal capacity having to be used to supply the electricity needed to heat homes and other buildings. In Asia, the extreme temperatures also resulted in electricity supply shortages, requiring the use of oil in Japan and requests to curb power demand. Japan and China are competing for LNG supplies, and LNG tanker prices have spiked due to the higher demand, record exports from the United States and delays traversing the Panama Canal. Policy makers would be prudent to study these other nations to ensure that the benefits of U.S. energy independence are enjoyed and not squandered away through bad policy choices. \nThe post Extreme Cold and Lower Renewable Energy Output Spike Electricity Prices in Europe and Asia appeared first on IER.",

                "text": "Ken Stringfellow en una foto promocional. \nEmpieza el 2021 y en este inicio de a\u00f1o azotado a\u00fan por los recurrentes envites de la pandemia son las instituciones las que en mayor medida siguen apostando por la cultura presencial y segura en Castell\u00f3n. Las restricciones impuestas por el coronavirus interfieren en la actividad de las salas de conciertos, empuj\u00e1ndolas a algo parecido a una hibernaci\u00f3n forzosa con una programaci\u00f3n absolutamente mermada. \nLa Bohemia es uno de los pocos espacios no institucionales que est\u00e1n programando m\u00fasica en directo con regularidad esta temporada. Con su segunda edici\u00f3n del ciclo Ac\u00fastics a La Bohemia (tras poner m\u00fasica a los \u00faltimos meses de 2020), el centro cultural organiza cuatro nuevos conciertos para mantener viva la llama en Castell\u00f3 durante enero y febrero. Las entradas se pueden comprar de manera online en Notikumi, donde se ofrece informaci\u00f3n de los asientos a\u00fan disponibles para respetar la distancia de seguridad entre asistentes. \nKen Stringfellow (S\u00e1bado 23 de enero a las 19:00) \nEl rockero californiano vuelve a Castell\u00f3n en medio de una gira por Espa\u00f1a donde solo actuar\u00e1 en Madrid, Barcelona y la capital de La Plana Alta. El estadounidense debut\u00f3 en The Posies en el a\u00f1o 1988 y en dicho grupo public\u00f3 Frosting on Beater (Geffen Records, 1993), considerado uno de los mejores discos de pop de la historia. Ha formado parte de grupos como R.E.M., participando activamente en la grabaci\u00f3n de Reveal (Warner Bros, 2001) y Around the Sun (Warner Bros, 2004), o Big Star. En su particular curr\u00edculum ha colaborado con m\u00fasicos de la talla de Neil Young, Snow Patrol, Patti Smith, Mudhoney o Ringo Starr. \nEntre sus proyectos personales podemos encontrar la formaci\u00f3n del grupo escandinavo The Disciplines (garage rock, Noruega) o la publicaci\u00f3n de discos en solitario desde 1997. La \u00faltima vez que visit\u00f3 Castell\u00f3n fue en el lejano enero de 2020, tambi\u00e9n en La Bohemia, recuperando su disco Touched (Manifesto Records, 2001) con motivo de la celebraci\u00f3n de sus treinta a\u00f1os encima de los escenarios. Trabajo discogr\u00e1fico que vio la luz el d\u00eda de los atentados del 11s. \n \nSantero y Los Muchachos (S\u00e1bado 6 de febrero a las 19:00) \nTras su paso por grupos de corte m\u00e1s duro como La Pulquer\u00eda, Absenta, Docs, Madnoise, Miss-X o Obrint Pas, estos m\u00fasicos valencianos se decidieron a crear una formaci\u00f3n en la que pudieran dar rienda suelta a su verdadero estilo: un rock m\u00e1s puro y reposado. Dicha banda recibir\u00eda el nombre de Santero y Los Muchachos, y publicar\u00eda dos \u00e1lbumes de estudio tras su formaci\u00f3n: Ventura (Act\u00faa Music Entertainment, 2017) y Rioflorido (Act\u00faa Music Entertainment, 2019). Curiosamente, su segundo lanzamiento fue grabado en un palacete deshabitado de Val\u00e8ncia, en el que la banda se traslad\u00f3 durante un a\u00f1o para ensayar y trabajar un disco que finalmente recibir\u00eda el nombre del primer marqu\u00e9s que habit\u00f3 la hacienda. \nSu estilo distintivo en la tendencia actual les ha llevado a colaborar con artistas como Leiva, Badlands, Tarque o Tangwero. Santero y Los Muchachos, formado por Miguel \u00c1ngel y Josem\u00e1n Escriv\u00e1 (hijos de Jos\u00e9 Escriv\u00e1, bajista de Los Top-Son), Soni Artal y Marc Guardiola, visita Castell\u00f3n tras cinco sold outs en Val\u00e8ncia durante el verano pasado. \n \nAndreu Valor (S\u00e1bado 13 de febrero a las 19:00) \nEl prol\u00edfico cantautor de Cocentaina se encuentra en un perfecto estado de forma tras la publicaci\u00f3n de su octavo trabajo de estudio, Insurrecte (Metr\u00f2nom), a inicios del a\u00f1o pasado. Insurrecte, lejos de presentar una continuaci\u00f3n l\u00f3gica en la obra del cantante, apuesta por la versi\u00f3n de algunos temas de sus discos anteriores como Malgrat la pluja (M\u00e9sdemil, 2003) y A l\u2019ombra de l\u2019obscuritat (M\u00e9sdemil, 2012) con la interpretaci\u00f3n de canciones in\u00e9ditas en un trabajado pop-folk que nos traslada al norte del continente europeo. \nGracias a esta particular apuesta, en la que las letras de siempre se cantan como nunca, se le otorg\u00f3 el premio Carles Santos 2020 al Mejor disco de canci\u00f3n de autor. As\u00ed como el reconocimiento a la Mejor gira por mantener un buen circuito de conciertos durante el est\u00edo en fechas importantes para el \u00e1mbito valenciano como el Feslloc. \n \nLola Bou i Manel Brancal (S\u00e1bado 20 de febrero a las 19:00) \nSinergia es el nombre que recibe el d\u00fao formado por dos m\u00fasicos castellonenses nacido en plena pandemia del coronavirus en marzo del a\u00f1o pasado. El proyecto lo forman la cantante y pianista almassorina Lola Bou (que vuelve a la carga tras una d\u00e9cada de inactividad y la publicaci\u00f3n de dos discos en solitario a sus espaldas) y el guitarrista local Manel Brancal, presente tambi\u00e9n en otros proyectos como Monodesnudo. \nLola Bou i Manel Brancal iniciaron la programaci\u00f3n del Paranimf de l\u2019Uji despu\u00e9s del confinamiento, estrenando los actos culturales en lugares cerrados en la \u00abnueva normalidad\u00bb. En La Bohemia, su interpretaci\u00f3n promete un encuentro \u00edntimo marcado por el poder\u00edo de la voz de Lola Bou.",

                "text": "Conspiracy = The act of two or more persons, called\u00a0conspirators, working\u00a0secretly\u00a0to obtain some goal, usually understood with negative\u00a0connotations. \n\n\n\nI\u2019m guessing that most people laughing about conspiracies, don\u2019t really know what it mean in a dictionary sense. Most of these people think it\u2019s all about these weirdos claiming that the reptile aliens run the world and that the earth is flat. My interest is the topic is when sober evidence points in the direction of a conspiracy and are more plausible than the official explanation. \n\n\n\nThe DuPont conspiracy was proven right, the company willfully poisoned the water for thousands and ended up paying $671 million in cash to settle thousands of lawsuits involving a leak of a toxic chemical used to make\u00a0Teflon. (Read the full story further down on this page). \n\n\n\nIn 2019 the biopic \u201cDark Waters\u201d came out and brought the whole thing to the mainstream audience attention. \n\n\n\nDark Waters (2019)\n\n\n\n\n8/10\n\n\n\nSynopsis: Based on a true story conspiracy. A corporate defense attorney takes on an environmental lawsuit against a chemical company that exposes a lengthy history of pollution. \n\n\n\nReview: I looooove movies about conspiracies and I have always liked Mark Ruffalo, he has a calm and warmth about him that I enjoy. The topic is chilling, but also important to bring to peoples attention, how a company just to make money willfully poisons thousands upon thousands of people. I only wished it was a bit longer so we could have had even more details on the attempt to cover it all up. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe BBC Documentary\n\n\n\nA BBC Storyville documentary following a group of citizens in West Virginia who take on the Dupont corporation after they discover it has been dumping a toxic chemical into the water supply. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Whole Story\n\n\n\nThe Lawyer Who Became DuPont\u2019s Worst Nightmare\n\n\n\nJust months before Rob Bilott made partner at Taft Stettinius & Hollister, he received a call on his direct line from a cattle farmer. The farmer, Wilbur Tennant of Parkersburg, W.Va., said that his cows were dying left and right. He believed that the DuPont chemical company, which until recently operated a site in Parkersburg that is more than 35 times the size of the Pentagon, was responsible. Tennant had tried to seek help locally, he said, but DuPont just about owned the entire town. He had been spurned not only by Parkersburg\u2019s lawyers but also by its politicians, journalists, doctors and veterinarians. The farmer was angry and spoke in a heavy Appalachian accent. Bilott struggled to make sense of everything he was saying. He might have hung up had Tennant not blurted out the name of Bilott\u2019s grandmother, Alma Holland White. \n\n\n\nWhite had lived in Vienna, a northern suburb of Parkersburg, and as a child, Bilott often visited her in the summers. In 1973 she brought him to the cattle farm belonging to the Tennants\u2019 neighbors, the Grahams, with whom White was friendly. Bilott spent the weekend riding horses, milking cows and watching Secretariat win the Triple Crown on TV. He was 7 years old. The visit to the Grahams\u2019 farm was one of his happiest childhood memories. \n\n\n\nWhen the Grahams heard in 1998 that Wilbur Tennant was looking for legal help, they remembered Bilott, White\u2019s grandson, who had grown up to become an environmental lawyer. They did not understand, however, that Bilott was not the right kind of environmental lawyer. He did not represent plaintiffs or private citizens. Like the other 200 lawyers at Taft, a firm founded in 1885 and tied historically to the family of President William Howard Taft, Bilott worked almost exclusively for large corporate clients. His specialty was defending chemical companies. Several times, Bilott had even worked on cases with DuPont lawyers. Nevertheless, as a favor to his grandmother, he agreed to meet the farmer. \u2018\u2018It just felt like the right thing to do,\u2019\u2019 he says today. \u2018\u2018I felt a connection to those folks.\u2019\u2019 \n\n\n\nThe connection was not obvious at their first meeting. About a week after his phone call, Tennant drove from Parkersburg with his wife to Taft\u2019s headquarters in downtown Cincinnati. They hauled cardboard boxes containing videotapes, photographs and documents into the firm\u2019s glassed-in reception area on the 18th floor, where they sat in gray midcentury-modern couches beneath an oil portrait of one of Taft\u2019s founders. Tennant \u2014 burly and nearly six feet tall, wearing jeans, a plaid flannel shirt and a baseball cap \u2014 did not resemble a typical Taft client. \u2018\u2018He didn\u2019t show up at our offices looking like a bank vice president,\u2019\u2019 says Thomas Terp, a partner who was Bilott\u2019s supervisor. \u2018\u2018Let\u2019s put it that way.\u2019\u2019 \n\n\n\nTerp joined Bilott for the meeting. Wilbur Tennant explained that he and his four siblings had run the cattle farm since their father abandoned them as children. They had seven cows then. Over the decades they steadily acquired land and cattle, until 200 cows roamed more than 600 hilly acres. The property would have been even larger had his brother Jim and Jim\u2019s wife, Della, not sold 66 acres in the early \u201980s to DuPont. The company wanted to use the plot for a landfill for waste from its factory near Parkersburg, called Washington Works, where Jim was employed as a laborer. Jim and Della did not want to sell, but Jim had been in poor health for years, mysterious ailments that doctors couldn\u2019t diagnose, and they needed the money. \n\n\n\nDuPont rechristened the plot Dry Run Landfill, named after the creek that ran through it. The same creek flowed down to a pasture where the Tennants grazed their cows. Not long after the sale, Wilbur told Bilott, the cattle began to act deranged. They had always been like pets to the Tennants. At the sight of a Tennant they would amble over, nuzzle and let themselves be milked. No longer. Now when they saw the farmers, they charged. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWilbur fed a videotape into the VCR. The footage, shot on a camcorder, was grainy and intercut with static. Images jumped and repeated. The sound accelerated and slowed down. It had the quality of a horror movie. In the opening shot the camera pans across the creek. It takes in the surrounding forest, the white ash trees shedding their leaves and the rippling, shallow water, before pausing on what appears to be a snowbank at an elbow in the creek. The camera zooms in, revealing a mound of soapy froth. \n\n\n\n\u2018\u2018I\u2019ve taken two dead deer and two dead cattle off this ripple,\u2019\u2019 Tennant says in voice-over. \u2018\u2018The blood run out of their noses and out their mouths. \u2026 They\u2019re trying to cover this stuff up. But it\u2019s not going to be covered up, because I\u2019m going to bring it out in the open for people to see.\u2019\u2019 \n\n\n\nThe video shows a large pipe running into the creek, discharging green water with bubbles on the surface. \u2018\u2018This is what they expect a man\u2019s cows to drink on his own property,\u2019\u2019 Wilbur says. \u2018\u2018It\u2019s about high time that someone in the state department of something-or-another got off their cans.\u2019\u2019 \n\n\n\nAt one point, the video cuts to a skinny red cow standing in hay. Patches of its hair are missing, and its back is humped \u2014 a result, Wilbur speculates, of a kidney malfunction. Another blast of static is followed by a close-up of a dead black calf lying in the snow, its eye a brilliant, chemical blue. \u2018\u2018One hundred fifty-three of these animals I\u2019ve lost on this farm,\u2019\u2019 Wilbur says later in the video. \u2018\u2018Every veterinarian that I\u2019ve called in Parkersburg, they will not return my phone calls or they don\u2019t want to get involved. Since they don\u2019t want to get involved, I\u2019ll have to dissect this thing myself. \u2026 I\u2019m going to start at this head.\u2019\u2019 \n\n\n\nThe video cuts to a calf\u2019s bisected head. Close-ups follow of the calf\u2019s blackened teeth (\u2018\u2018They say that\u2019s due to high concentrations of fluoride in the water that they drink\u2019\u2019), its liver, heart, stomachs, kidneys and gall bladder. Each organ is sliced open, and Wilbur points out unusual discolorations \u2014 some dark, some green \u2014 and textures. \u2018\u2018I don\u2019t even like the looks of them,\u2019\u2019 he says. \u2018\u2018It don\u2019t look like anything I\u2019ve been into before.\u2019\u2019 \n\n\n\nBilott watched the video and looked at photographs for several hours. He saw cows with stringy tails, malformed hooves, giant lesions protruding from their hides and red, receded eyes; cows suffering constant diarrhea, slobbering white slime the consistency of toothpaste, staggering bowlegged like drunks. Tennant always zoomed in on his cows\u2019 eyes. \u2018\u2018This cow\u2019s done a lot of suffering,\u2019\u2019 he would say, as a blinking eye filled the screen. \n\n\n\n\u2018\u2018This is bad,\u2019\u2019 Bilott said to himself. \u2018\u2018There\u2019s something really bad going on here.\u2019\u2019 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBilott decided right\u00a0away to take the Tennant case. It was, he says again, \u2018\u2018the right thing to do.\u2019\u2019 Bilott might have had the practiced look of a corporate lawyer \u2014 soft-spoken, milk-complected, conservatively attired \u2014 but the job had not come naturally to him. He did not have a typical Taft r\u00e9sum\u00e9. He had not attended college or law school in the Ivy League. His father was a lieutenant colonel in the Air Force, and Bilott spent most of his childhood moving among air bases near Albany; Flint, Mich.; Newport Beach, Calif.; and Wiesbaden, West Germany. Bilott attended eight schools before graduating from Fairborn High, near Ohio\u2019s Wright-Patterson Air Force Base. As a junior, he received a recruitment letter from a tiny liberal-arts school in Sarasota called the New College of Florida, which graded pass/fail and allowed students to design their own curriculums. Many of his friends there were idealistic, progressive \u2014 ideological misfits in Reagan\u2019s America. He met with professors individually and came to value critical thinking. \u2018\u2018I learned to question everything you read,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u2018\u2018Don\u2019t take anything at face value. Don\u2019t care what other people say. I liked that philosophy.\u2019\u2019 Bilott studied political science and wrote his thesis about the rise and fall of Dayton. He hoped to become a city manager. \n\n\n\nBut his father, who late in life enrolled in law school, encouraged Bilott to do the same. Surprising his professors, he chose to attend law school at Ohio State, where his favorite course was environmental law. \u2018\u2018It seemed like it would have real-world impact,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u2018\u2018It was something you could do to make a difference.\u2019\u2019 When, after graduation, Taft made him an offer, his mentors and friends from New College were aghast. They didn\u2019t understand how he could join a corporate firm. Bilott didn\u2019t see it that way. He hadn\u2019t really thought about the ethics of it, to be honest. \u2018\u2018My family said that a big firm was where you\u2019d get the most opportunities,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u2018\u2018I knew nobody who had ever worked at a firm, nobody who knew anything about it. I just tried to get the best job I could. I don\u2019t think I had any clue of what that involved.\u2019\u2019 \n\n\n\nAt Taft, he asked to join Thomas Terp\u2019s environmental team. Ten years earlier, Congress passed the legislation known as Superfund, which financed the emergency cleanup of hazardous-waste dumps. Superfund was a lucrative development for firms like Taft, creating an entire subfield within environmental law, one that required a deep understanding of the new regulations in order to guide negotiations among municipal agencies and numerous private parties. Terp\u2019s team at Taft was a leader in the field. \n\n\n\nAs an associate, Bilott was asked to determine which companies contributed which toxins and hazardous wastes in what quantities to which sites. He took depositions from plant employees, perused public records and organized huge amounts of historical data. He became an expert on the Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s regulatory framework, the Safe Drinking Water Act, the Clean Air Act, the Toxic Substances Control Act. He mastered the chemistry of the pollutants, despite the fact that chemistry had been his worst subject in high school. \u2018\u2018I learned how these companies work, how the laws work, how you defend these claims,\u2019\u2019 he said. He became the consummate insider. \n\n\n\nBilott was proud of the work he did. The main part of his job, as he understood it, was to help clients comply with the new regulations. Many of his clients, including Thiokol and Bee Chemical, disposed of hazardous waste long before the practice became so tightly regulated. He worked long hours and knew few people in Cincinnati. A colleague on Taft\u2019s environmental team, observing that he had little time for a social life, introduced him to a childhood friend named Sarah Barlage. She was a lawyer, too, at another downtown Cincinnati firm, where she de\u00adfended corporations against worker\u2019s-compensation claims. Bilott joined the two friends for lunch. Sarah doesn\u2019t remember him speaking. \u2018\u2018My first impression was that he was not like other guys,\u2019\u2019 she says. \u2018\u2018I\u2019m pretty chatty. He\u2019s much quieter. We complemented each other. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThey married in 1996. The first of their three sons was born two years later. He felt secure enough at Taft for Barlage to quit her job and raise their children full-time. Terp, his supervisor, recalls him as \u2018\u2018a real standout lawyer: incredibly bright, energetic, tenacious and very, very thorough.\u2019\u2019 He was a model Taft lawyer. Then Wilbur Tennant came along. \n\n\n\nThe Tennant case put Taft in a highly unusual position. The law firm was in the business of representing chemical corporations, not suing them. The prospect of taking on DuPont \u2018\u2018did cause us pause,\u2019\u2019 Terp concedes. \u2018\u2018But it was not a terribly difficult decision for us. I\u2019m a firm believer that our work on the plaintiff\u2019s side makes us better defense lawyers.\u2019\u2019 \n\n\n\nBilott sought help with the Tennant case from a West Virginia lawyer named Larry Winter. For many years, Winter was a partner at Spilman, Thomas & Battle \u2014 one of the firms that represented DuPont in West Virginia \u2014 though he had left Spilman to start a practice specializing in personal-injury cases. He was amazed that Bilott would sue DuPont while remaining at Taft. \n\n\n\n\u2018\u2018His taking on the Tennant case,\u2019\u2019 Winter says, \u2018\u2018given the type of practice Taft had, I found to be inconceivable.\u2019\u2019 \n\n\n\nBilott, for his part, is reluctant to discuss his motivations for taking the case. The closest he came to elaborating was after being asked whether, having set out \u2018\u2018to make a difference\u2019\u2019 in the world, he had any misgivings about the path his career had taken. \n\n\n\n\u2018\u2018There was a reason why I was interested in helping out the Tennants,\u2019\u2019 he said after a pause. \u2018\u2018It was a great opportunity to use my background for people who really needed it.\u2019\u2019 \n\n\n\nBilott filed a federal suit\u00a0against DuPont in the summer of 1999 in the Southern District of West Virginia. In response, DuPont\u2019s in-house lawyer, Bernard Reilly, informed him that DuPont and the E.P.A. would commission a study of the property, conducted by three veterinarians chosen by DuPont and three chosen by the E.P.A. Their report did not find DuPont responsible for the cattle\u2019s health problems. The culprit, instead, was poor husbandry: \u2018\u2018poor nutrition, inadequate veterinary care and lack of fly control.\u2019\u2019 In other words, the Tennants didn\u2019t know how to raise cattle; if the cows were dying, it was their own fault. \n\n\n\nThis did not sit well with the Tennants, who began to suffer the consequences of antagonizing Parkersburg\u2019s main employer. Lifelong friends ignored the Tennants on the streets of Parkersburg and walked out of restaurants when they entered. \u2018\u2018I\u2019m not allowed to talk to you,\u2019\u2019 they said, when confronted. Four different times, the Tennants changed churches. \n\n\n\nWilbur called the office nearly every day, but Bilott had little to tell him. He was doing for the Tennants what he would have done for any of his corporate clients \u2014 pulling permits, studying land deeds and requesting from DuPont all documentation related to Dry Run Landfill \u2014 but he could find no evidence that explained what was happening to the cattle. \u2018\u2018We were getting frustrated,\u2019\u2019 Bilott said. \u2018\u2018I couldn\u2019t blame the Tennants for getting angry.\u2019\u2019 \n\n\n\nWith the trial looming, Bilott stumbled upon a letter DuPont had sent to the E.P.A. that mentioned a substance at the landfill with a cryptic name: \u2018\u2018PFOA.\u2019\u2019 In all his years working with chemical companies, Bilott had never heard of PFOA. It did not appear on any list of regulated materials, nor could he find it in Taft\u2019s in-house library. The chemistry expert that he had retained for the case did, however, vaguely recall an article in a trade journal about a similar-sounding compound: PFOS, a soaplike agent used by the technology conglomerate 3M in the fabrication of Scotchgard. \n\n\n\nBilott hunted through his files for other references to PFOA, which he learned was short for perfluorooctanoic acid. But there was nothing. He asked DuPont to share all documentation related to the substance; DuPont refused. In the fall of 2000, Bilott requested a court order to force them. Against DuPont\u2019s protests, the order was granted. Dozens of boxes containing thousands of unorganized documents began to arrive at Taft\u2019s headquarters: private internal correspondence, medical and health reports and confidential studies conducted by DuPont scientists. There were more than 110,000 pages in all, some half a century old. Bilott spent the next few months on the floor of his office, poring over the documents and arranging them in chronological order. He stopped answering his office phone. When people called his secretary, she explained that he was in the office but had not been able to reach the phone in time, because he was trapped on all sides by boxes. \n\n\n\nI started seeing a story,\u2019\u2019 Bilott said. \u2018\u2018I may have been the first one to actually go through them all. It became apparent what was going on: They had known for a long time that this stuff was bad.\u2019\u2019 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBilott is given to understatement. (\u2018\u2018To say that Rob Bilott is understated,\u2019\u2019 his colleague Edison Hill says, \u2018\u2018is an understatement.\u2019\u2019) The story that Bilott began to see, cross-legged on his office floor, was astounding in its breadth, specificity and sheer brazenness. \u2018\u2018I was shocked,\u2019\u2019 he said. That was another understatement. Bilott could not believe the scale of incriminating material that DuPont had sent him. The company appeared not to realize what it had handed over. \u2018\u2018It was one of those things where you can\u2019t believe you\u2019re reading what you\u2019re reading,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u2018\u2018That it\u2019s actually been put in writing. It was the kind of stuff you always heard about happening but you never thought you\u2019d see written down.\u2019\u2019 \n\n\n\nThe story began\u00a0in 1951, when DuPont started purchasing PFOA (which the company refers to as C8) from 3M for use in the manufacturing of Teflon. 3M invented PFOA just four years earlier; it was used to keep coatings like Teflon from clumping during production. Though PFOA was not classified by the government as a hazardous substance, 3M sent DuPont recommendations on how to dispose of it. It was to be incinerated or sent to chemical-waste facilities. DuPont\u2019s own instructions specified that it was not to be flushed into surface water or sewers. But over the decades that followed, DuPont pumped hundreds of thousands of pounds of PFOA powder through the outfall pipes of the Parkersburg facility into the Ohio River. The company dumped 7,100 tons of PFOA-laced sludge into \u2018\u2018digestion ponds\u2019\u2019: open, unlined pits on the Washington Works property, from which the chemical could seep straight into the ground. PFOA entered the local water table, which supplied drinking water to the communities of Parkersburg, Vienna, Little Hocking and Lubeck \u2014 more than 100,000 people in all. \n\n\n\nBilott learned from the documents that 3M and DuPont had been conducting secret medical studies on PFOA for more than four decades. In 1961, DuPont researchers found that the chemical could increase the size of the liver in rats and rabbits. A year later, they replicated these results in studies with dogs. PFOA\u2019s peculiar chemical structure made it uncannily resistant to degradation. It also bound to plasma proteins in the blood, circulating through each organ in the body. In the 1970s, DuPont discovered that there were high concentrations of PFOA in the blood of factory workers at Washington Works. They did not tell the E.P.A. at the time. In 1981, 3M \u2014 which continued to serve as the supplier of PFOA to DuPont and other corporations \u2014 found that ingestion of the substance caused birth defects in rats. After 3M shared this information, DuPont tested the children of pregnant employees in their Teflon division. Of seven births, two had eye defects. DuPont did not make this information public. \n\n\n\nIn 1984, DuPont became aware that dust vented from factory chimneys settled well beyond the property line and, more disturbing, that PFOA was present in the local water supply. DuPont declined to disclose this finding. In 1991, DuPont scientists determined an internal safety limit for PFOA concentration in drinking water: one part per billion. The same year, DuPont found that water in one local district contained PFOA levels at three times that figure. Despite internal debate, it declined to make the information public. \n\n\n\n(In a statement, DuPont claimed that it did volunteer health information about PFOA to the E.P.A. during those decades. When asked for evidence, it forwarded two letters written to West Virginian government agencies from 1982 and 1992, both of which cited internal studies that called into question links between PFOA exposure and human health problems.) \n\n\n\nBy the \u201990s, Bilott discovered, DuPont understood that PFOA caused cancerous testicular, pancreatic and liver tumors in lab animals. One laboratory study suggested possible DNA damage from PFOA exposure, and a study of workers linked exposure with prostate cancer. DuPont at last hastened to develop an alternative to PFOA. An interoffice memo sent in 1993 announced that \u2018\u2018for the first time, we have a viable candidate\u2019\u2019 that appeared to be less toxic and stayed in the body for a much shorter duration of time. Discussions were held at DuPont\u2019s corporate headquarters to discuss switching to the new compound. DuPont decided against it. The risk was too great: Products manufactured with PFOA were an important part of DuPont\u2019s business, worth $1 billion in annual profit. \n\n\n\nBut the crucial discovery for the Tennant case was this: By the late 1980s, as DuPont became increasingly concerned about the health effects of PFOA waste, it decided it needed to find a landfill for the toxic sludge dumped on company property. Fortunately they had recently bought 66 acres from a low-level employee at the Washington Works facility that would do perfectly. \n\n\n\nBy 1990, DuPont had dumped 7,100 tons of PFOA sludge into Dry Run Landfill. DuPont\u2019s scientists understood that the landfill drained into the Tennants\u2019 remaining property, and they tested the water in Dry Run Creek. It contained an extraordinarily high concentration of PFOA. DuPont did not tell this to the Tennants at the time, nor did it disclose the fact in the cattle report that it commissioned for the Tennant case a decade later \u2014 the report that blamed poor husbandry for the deaths of their cows. Bilott had what he needed. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn August 2000,\u00a0Bilott called DuPont\u2019s lawyer, Bernard Reilly, and explained that he knew what was going on. It was a brief conversation. \n\n\n\nThe Tennants settled. The firm would receive its contingency fee. The whole business might have ended right there. But Bilott was not satisfied. \n\n\n\n\u2018\u2018I was irritated,\u2019\u2019 he says. \n\n\n\nDuPont was nothing like the corporations he had represented at Taft in the Superfund cases. \u2018\u2018This was a completely different scenario. DuPont had for decades been actively trying to conceal their actions. They knew this stuff was harmful, and they put it in the water anyway. These were bad facts.\u2019\u2019 He had seen what the PFOA-tainted drinking water had done to cattle. What was it doing to the tens of thousands of people in the areas around Parkersburg who drank it daily from their taps? What did the insides of their heads look like? Were their internal organs green? \n\n\n\nBilott spent the following months drafting a public brief against DuPont. It was 972 pages long, including 136 attached exhibits. His colleagues call it \u2018\u2018Rob\u2019s Famous Letter.\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018We have confirmed that the chemicals and pollutants released into the environment by DuPont at its Dry Run Landfill and other nearby DuPont-owned facilities may pose an imminent and substantial threat to health or the environment,\u2019\u2019 Bilott wrote. He demanded immediate action to regulate PFOA and provide clean water to those living near the factory. On March 6, 2001, he sent the letter to the director of every relevant regulatory authority, including Christie Whitman, administrator of the E.P.A., and the United States attorney general, John Ashcroft. \n\n\n\nDuPont reacted quickly, requesting a gag order to block Bilott from providing the information he had discovered in the Tennant case to the government. A federal court denied it. Bilott sent his entire case file to the E.P.A. \n\n\n\n\u2018\u2018DuPont freaked out when they realized that this guy was onto them,\u2019\u2019 says Ned McWilliams, a young trial lawyer who later joined Bilott\u2019s legal team. \u2018\u2018For a corporation to seek a gag order to prevent somebody from speaking to the E.P.A. is an extraordinary remedy. You could realize how bad that looks. They must have known that there was a small chance of winning. But they were so afraid that they were willing to roll the dice.\u2019\u2019 \n\n\n\nWith the Famous Letter, Bilott crossed a line. Though nominally representing the Tennants \u2014 their settlement had yet to be concluded \u2014 Bilott spoke for the public, claiming extensive fraud and wrongdoing. He had become a threat not merely to DuPont but also to, in the words of one internal memo, \u2018\u2018the entire fluoropolymers industry\u2019\u2019 \u2014 an industry responsible for the high-performance plastics used in many modern devices, including kitchen products, computer cables, implantable medical devices and bearings and seals used in cars and airplanes. PFOA was only one of more than 60,000 synthetic chemicals that companies produced and released into the world without regulatory oversight. \n\n\n\n\u2018\u2018Rob\u2019s letter lifted the curtain on a whole new theater,\u2019\u2019 says Harry Deitzler, a plaintiff\u2019s lawyer in West Virginia who works with Bilott. \u2018\u2018Before that letter, corporations could rely upon the public misperception that if a chemical was dangerous, it was regulated.\u2019\u2019 Under the 1976 Toxic Sub\u00adstances Control Act, the E.P.A. can test chemicals only when it has been provided evidence of harm. This arrangement, which largely allows chemical companies to regulate themselves, is the reason that the E.P.A. has restricted only five chemicals, out of tens of thousands on the market, in the last 40 years. \n\n\n\nIt was especially damning to see these allegations against DuPont under the letterhead of one of the nation\u2019s most prestigious corporate defense firms. \u2018\u2018You can imagine what some of the other companies that Taft was representing \u2014 a Dow Chemical \u2014 might have thought of a Taft lawyer taking on DuPont,\u2019\u2019 Larry Winter says. \u2018\u2018There was a threat that the firm would suffer financially.\u2019\u2019 When I asked Thomas Terp about Taft\u2019s reaction to the Famous Letter, he replied, not quite convincingly, that he didn\u2019t recall one. \u2018\u2018Our partners,\u2019\u2019 he said, \u2018\u2018are proud of the work that he has done.\u2019\u2019 \n\n\n\nBilott, however, worried that corporations doing business with Taft might see things differently. \u2018\u2018I\u2019m not stupid, and the people around me aren\u2019t stupid,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u2018\u2018You can\u2019t ignore the economic realities of the ways that business is run and the way clients think. I perceived that there were some \u2018What the hell are you doing?\u2019 responses.\u2019\u2019 \n\n\n\nThe letter led, four years later, in 2005, to DuPont\u2019s reaching a $16.5 million settlement with the E.P.A., which had accused the company of concealing its knowledge of PFOA\u2019s toxicity and presence in the environment in violation of the Toxic Substances Control Act. (DuPont was not required to admit liability.) At the time, it was the largest civil administrative penalty the E.P.A. had obtained in its history, a statement that sounds more impressive than it is. The fine represented less than 2 percent of the profits earned by DuPont on PFOA that year. \n\n\n\nBilott never represented a corporate client again. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe obvious next\u00a0step was to file a class-action lawsuit against DuPont on behalf of everyone whose water was tainted by PFOA. In all ways but one, Bilott himself was in the ideal position to file such a suit. He understood PFOA\u2019s history as well as anyone inside DuPont did. He had the technical and regulatory expertise, as he had proved in the Tennant case. The only part that didn\u2019t make sense was his firm: No Taft lawyer, to anyone\u2019s recollection, had ever filed a class-action lawsuit. \n\n\n\nIt was one thing to pursue a sentimental case on behalf of a few West Virginia cattle farmers and even write a public letter to the E.P.A. But an industry-threatening class-action suit against one of the world\u2019s largest chemical corporations was different. It might establish a precedent for suing corporations over unregulated sub\u00adstances and imperil Taft\u2019s bottom line. This point was made to Terp by Bernard Reilly, DuPont\u2019s in-house lawyer, according to accounts from Bilott\u2019s plaintiff\u2019s-lawyer colleagues; they say Reilly called to demand that Bilott back off the case. (Terp confirms that Reilly called him but will not disclose the content of the call; Bilott and Reilly decline to speak about it, citing continuing litigation.) Given what Bilott had documented in his Famous Letter, Taft stood by its partner. \n\n\n\nA lead plaintiff soon presented himself. Joseph Kiger, a night-school teacher in Parkersburg, called Bilott to ask for help. About nine months earlier, he received a peculiar note from the Lubeck water district. It arrived on Halloween day, enclosed in the monthly water bill. The note explained that an unregulated chemical named PFOA had been detected in the drinking water in \u2018\u2018low concentrations,\u2019\u2019 but that it was not a health risk. Kiger had underlined statements that he found particularly baffling, like: \u2018\u2018DuPont reports that it has toxicological and epidemiological data to support confidence that exposure guidelines established by DuPont are protective of human health.\u2019\u2019 The term \u2018\u2018support confidence\u2019\u2019 seemed bizarre, as did \u2018\u2018protective of human health,\u2019\u2019 not to mention the claim that DuPont\u2019s own data supported its confidence in its own guidelines. \n\n\n\nStill, Kiger might have forgotten about it had his wife, Darlene, not already spent much of her adulthood thinking about PFOA. Darlene\u2019s first husband had been a chemist in DuPont\u2019s PFOA lab. (Darlene asked that he not be named so that he wouldn\u2019t be involved in the local politics around the case.) \u2018\u2018When you worked at DuPont in this town,\u2019\u2019 Darlene says today, \u2018\u2018you could have everything you wanted.\u2019\u2019 DuPont paid for his education, it secured him a mortgage and it paid him a generous salary. DuPont even gave him a free supply of PFOA, which, Darlene says, she used as soap in the family\u2019s dishwasher and to clean the car. Sometimes her husband came home from work sick \u2014 fever, nausea, diarrhea, vomiting \u2014 after working in one of the PFOA storage tanks. It was a common occurrence at Washington Works. Darlene says the men at the plant called it \u2018\u2018Teflon flu.\u2019\u2019 \n\n\n\nIn 1976, after Darlene gave birth to their second child, her husband told her that he was not allowed to bring his work clothes home anymore. DuPont, he said, had found out that PFOA was causing health problems for women and birth defects in children. Darlene would remember this six years later when, at 36, she had to have an emergency hysterectomy and again eight years later, when she had a second surgery. When the strange letter from the water district arrived, Darlene says, \u2018\u2018I kept thinking back to his clothing, to my hysterectomy. I asked myself, what does DuPont have to do with our drinking water?\u2019\u2019 \n\n\n\nJoe called the West Virginia Department of Natural Resources (\u2018\u2018They treated me like I had the plague\u2019\u2019), the Parkersburg office of the state\u2019s Department of Environmental Protection (\u2018\u2018nothing to worry about\u2019\u2019), the water division (\u2018\u2018I got shut down\u2019\u2019), the local health department (\u2018\u2018just plain rude\u2019\u2019), even DuPont (\u2018\u2018I was fed the biggest line of [expletive] anybody could have been fed\u2019\u2019), before a scientist in the regional E.P.A. office finally took his call. \n\n\n\n\u2018\u2018Good God, Joe,\u2019\u2019 the scientist said. \u2018\u2018What the hell is that stuff doing in your water?\u2019\u2019 He sent Kiger information about the Tennant lawsuit. On the court papers Kiger kept seeing the same name: Robert Bilott, of Taft Stettinius & Hollister, in Cincinnati. \n\n\n\nBonnie Smalley, 35, who grew up near the DuPont facility in New Jersey  poses for a photo on Saturday, Feb. 22, 2020 in Denver. Photo by Michael Ciaglo\n\n\n\nBilott had anticipated\u00a0suing on behalf of the one or two water districts closest to Washington Works. But tests revealed that six districts, as well as dozens of private wells, were tainted with levels of PFOA higher than DuPont\u2019s own internal safety standard. In Little Hocking, the water tested positive for PFOA at seven times the limit. All told, 70,000 people were drinking poisoned water. Some had been doing so for decades. \n\n\n\nBut Bilott faced a vexing legal problem. PFOA was not a regulated substance. It appeared on no federal or state list of contaminants. How could Bilott claim that 70,000 people had been poisoned if the government didn\u2019t recognize PFOA as a toxin \u2014 if PFOA, legally speaking, was no different than water itself? In 2001, it could not even be proved that exposure to PFOA in public drinking water caused health problems. There was scant information available about its impact on large populations. How could the class prove it had been harmed by PFOA when the health effects were largely unknown? \n\n\n\nThe best metric Bilott had to judge a safe exposure level was DuPont\u2019s own internal limit of one part per billion. But when DuPont learned that Bilott was preparing a new lawsuit, it announced that it would re-evaluate that figure. As in the Tennant case, DuPont formed a team composed of its own scientists and scientists from the West Virginia Department of Environmental Protection. It announced a new threshold: 150 parts per billion. \n\n\n\nBilott found the figure \u2018\u2018mind-blowing.\u2019\u2019 The toxicologists he hired had settled upon a safety limit of 0.2 parts per billion. But West Virginia endorsed the new standard. Within two years, three lawyers regularly used by DuPont were hired by the state D.E.P. in leadership positions. One of them was placed in charge of the entire agency. \u2018\u2018The way that transpired was just amazing to me,\u2019\u2019 Bilott says. \u2018\u2018I suppose it wasn\u2019t so amazing to my fellow counsel in West Virginia who know the system there. But it was to me.\u2019\u2019 The same DuPont lawyers tasked with writing the safety limit, Bilott said, had become the government regulators responsible for enforcing that limit. \n\n\n\nBilott devised a new legal strategy. A year earlier, West Virginia had become one of the first states to recognize what is called, in tort law, a medical-monitoring claim. A plaintiff needs to prove only that he or she has been exposed to a toxin. If the plaintiff wins, the defendant is required to fund regular medical tests. In these cases, should a plaintiff later become ill, he or she can sue retroactively for damages. For this reason, Bilott filed the class-action suit in August 2001 in state court, even though four of the six affected water districts lay across the Ohio border. \n\n\n\nMeanwhile the E.P.A., drawing from Bilott\u2019s research, began its own investigation into the toxicity of PFOA. In 2002, the agency released its initial findings: PFOA might pose human health risks not only to those drinking tainted water, but also to the general public \u2014 anyone, for instance, who cooked with Teflon pans. The E.P.A. was particularly alarmed to learn that PFOA had been detected in American blood banks, something 3M and DuPont had known as early as 1976. By 2003 the average concentration of PFOA in the blood of an adult American was four to five parts per billion. In 2000, 3M ceased production of PFOA. DuPont, rather than use an alternative compound, built a new factory in Fayetteville, N.C., to manufacture the substance for its own use. \n\n\n\nBilott\u2019s strategy appeared to have worked. In September 2004, DuPont decided to settle the class-action suit. It agreed to install filtration plants in the six affected water districts if they wanted them and pay a cash award of $70 million. It would fund a scientific study to determine whether there was a \u2018\u2018probable link\u2019\u2019 \u2014 a term that delicately avoided any declaration of causation \u2014 between PFOA and any diseases. If such links existed, DuPont would pay for medical monitoring of the affected group in perpetuity. Until the scientific study came back with its results, class members were forbidden from filing personal-injury suits against DuPont. \n\n\n\nA reasonable expectation, at this point, was that the lawyers would move on. \u2018\u2018In any other class action you\u2019ve ever read about,\u2019\u2019 Deitzler says, \u2018\u2018you get your 10 bucks in the mail, the lawyers get paid and the lawsuit goes away. That\u2019s what we were supposed to do.\u2019\u2019 For three years, Bilott had worked for nothing, costing his firm a fortune. But now Taft received a windfall: Bilott and his team of West Virginian plaintiff lawyers received $21.7 million in fees from the settlement. \u2018\u2018I think they were thinking, This guy did O.K.,\u2019\u2019 Deitzler says. \u2018\u2018I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if he got a raise.\u2019\u2019 \n\n\n\nNot only had Taft recouped its losses, but DuPont was providing clean water to the communities named in the suit. Bilott had every reason to walk away. \n\n\n\nHe didn\u2019t. \n\n\n\n\u2018\u2018There was a\u00a0gap in the data,\u2019\u2019 Bilott says. The company\u2019s internal health studies, as damning as they were, were limited to factory employees. DuPont could argue \u2014 and had argued \u2014 that even if PFOA caused medical problems, it was only because factory workers had been exposed at exponentially higher levels than neighbors who drank tainted water. The gap allowed DuPont to claim that it had done nothing wrong. \n\n\n\nBilott represented 70,000 people who had been drinking PFOA-laced drinking water for decades. What if the settlement money could be used to test them? \u2018\u2018Class members were concerned about three things,\u2019\u2019 Winter says. \u2018\u2018One: Do I have C8 in my blood? Two: If I do, is it harmful? Three: If it\u2019s harmful, what are the effects?\u2019\u2019 Bilott and his colleagues realized they could answer all three questions, if only they could test their clients. Now, they realized, there was a way to do so. After the settlement, the legal team pushed to make receipt of the cash award contingent on a full medical examination. The class voted in favor of this approach, and within months, nearly 70,000 West Virginians were trading their blood for a $400 check. \n\n\n\nThe team of epidemiologists was flooded with medical data, and there was nothing DuPont could do to stop it. In fact, it was another term of the settlement that DuPont would fund the research without limitation. The scientists, freed from the restraints of academic budgets and grants, had hit the epidemiological jackpot: an entire population\u2019s personal data and infinite resources available to study them. The scientists designed 12 studies, including one that, using sophisticated environmental modeling technology, determined exactly how much PFOA each individual class member had ingested. \n\n\n\nIt was assured that the panel would return convincing results. But Bilott could not predict what those results would be. If no correlation was found between PFOA and illness, Bilott\u2019s clients would be barred under the terms of the agreement from filing any personal-injury cases. Because of the sheer quantity of data provided by the community health study and the un\u00adlimited budget \u2014 it ultimately cost DuPont $33 million \u2014 the panel took longer than ex\u00adpected to perform its analysis. Two years passed without any findings. Bilott waited. A third year passed. Then a fourth, a fifth, a sixth. Still the panel was quiet. Bilott waited. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt was not\u00a0a peaceful wait. The pressure on Bilott at Taft had built since he initiated the class-action suit in 2001. The legal fees had granted him a reprieve, but as the years passed without resolution, and Bilott continued to spend the firm\u2019s money and was unable to attract new clients, he found himself in an awkward position. \n\n\n\n\u2018\u2018This case,\u2019\u2019 Winter says, \u2018\u2018regardless of how hugely successful it ends up, will never in the Taft firm\u2019s mind replace what they\u2019ve lost in the way of legal business over the years.\u2019\u2019 \n\n\n\nThe longer it took for the science panel to conduct its research, the more expensive the case became. Taft continued to pay consultants to interpret the new findings and relay them to the epidemiologists. Bilott counseled class members in West Virginia and Ohio and traveled frequently to Washington to attend meetings at the E.P.A., which was deciding whether to issue advisories about PFOA. \u2018\u2018We were incurring a lot of expenses,\u2019\u2019 Bilott says. \u2018\u2018If the scientific panel found no link with diseases, we\u2019d have to eat it all.\u2019\u2019 \n\n\n\nClients called Bilott to say that they had received diagnoses of cancer or that a family member had died. They wanted to know why it was taking so long. When would they get relief? Among those who called was Jim Tennant. Wilbur, who had cancer, had died of a heart attack. Two years later, Wilbur\u2019s wife died of cancer. Bilott was tormented by \u2018\u2018the thought that we still hadn\u2019t been able to hold this company responsible for what they did in time for those people to see it.\u2019\u2019 \n\n\n\nTaft did not waver in its support of the case, but the strain began to show. \u2018\u2018It was stressful,\u2019\u2019 Sarah Barlage, Bilott\u2019s wife, says. \u2018\u2018He was exasperated that it was lasting a long time. But his heels were so dug in. He\u2019s extremely stubborn. Every day that went by with no movement gave him more drive to see it through. But in the back of our minds, we knew that there are cases that go on forever.\u2019\u2019 \n\n\n\nHis colleagues on the case detected a change in Bilott. \u2018\u2018I had the impression that it was extremely tough on him,\u2019\u2019 Winter says. \u2018\u2018Rob had a young family, kids growing up, and he was under pressure from his firm. Rob is a private person. He didn\u2019t complain. But he showed signs of being under enormous stress.\u2019\u2019 \n\n\n\nIn 2010, Bilott began suffering strange attacks: His vision would blur, he couldn\u2019t put on his socks, his arms felt numb. His doctors didn\u2019t know what was happening. The attacks recurred periodically, bringing blurry vision, slurred speech and difficulty moving one side of his body. They struck suddenly, without warning, and their effects lasted days. The doctors asked whether he was under heightened stress at work. \u2018\u2018Nothing different than normal,\u2019\u2019 Bilott told them. \u2018\u2018Nothing it hadn\u2019t been for years.\u2019\u2019 \n\n\n\nThe doctors ultimately hit upon an effective medication. The episodes ceased and their symptoms, apart from an occasional tic, are under control, but he still doesn\u2019t have a diagnosis. \n\n\n\n\u2018\u2018It was stressful,\u2019\u2019 Bilott says, \u2018\u2018not to know what the heck was going on.\u2019\u2019 \n\n\n\nIn December 2011,\u00a0after seven years, the scientists began to release their findings: there was a \u2018\u2018probable link\u2019\u2019 between PFOA and kidney cancer, testicular cancer, thyroid disease, high cholesterol, pre-eclampsia and ulcerative colitis. \n\n\n\n\u2018\u2018There was relief,\u2019\u2019 Bilott says, understated nearly to the point of self-effacement. \u2018\u2018We were able to deliver what we had promised to these folks seven years earlier. Especially since, for all those years, DuPont had been saying that we were lying, trying to scare and mislead people. Now we had a scientific answer.\u2019\u2019 \n\n\n\nAs of October, 3,535 plaintiffs have filed personal-injury lawsuits against DuPont. The first member of this group to go to trial was a kidney-cancer survivor named Carla Bartlett. In October,\u00a0Bartlett was awarded $1.6 million. DuPont plans to appeal. This may have ramifications well beyond Bartlett\u2019s case: Hers is one of five \u2018\u2018bellwether\u2019\u2019 cases that will be tried over the course of this year. After that, DuPont may choose to settle with every afflicted class member, using the outcome of the bellwether cases to determine settlement awards. Or DuPont can fight each suit individually, a tactic that tobacco companies have used to fight personal-injury lawsuits. At the rate of four trials a year, DuPont would continue to fight PFOA cases until the year 2890. \n\n\n\nParkersburg\n\n\n\nDuPont\u2019s continuing refusal to accept responsibility is maddening to Bilott. \u2018\u2018To think that you\u2019ve negotiated in good faith a deal that everybody has abided by and worked on for seven years, you reach a point where certain things were to be resolved but then remain contested,\u2019\u2019 he says. \u2018\u2018I think about the clients who have been waiting for this, many of whom are sick or have died while waiting. It\u2019s infuriating.\u2019\u2019 \n\n\n\nAs part of its agreement with the E.P.A., DuPont ceased production and use of PFOA in 2013. The five other companies in the world that produce PFOA are also phasing out production. DuPont, which is currently negotiating a merger with Dow Chemical, last year severed its chemical businesses: They have been spun off into a new corporation called Chemours. The new company has replaced PFOA with similar fluorine-based compounds designed to biodegrade more quickly \u2014 the alternative considered and then discarded by DuPont more than 20 years ago. Like PFOA, these new substances have not come under any regulation from the E.P.A. When asked about the safety of the new chemicals, Chemours replied in a statement: \u2018\u2018A significant body of data demonstrates that these alternative chemistries can be used safely.\u2019\u2019 \n\n\n\nLast May, 200 scientists from a variety of disciplines signed\u00a0the Madrid Statement, which expresses concern about the production of all fluorochemicals, or PFASs, including those that have replaced PFOA. PFOA and its replacements are suspected to belong to a large class of artificial compounds called endocrine-disrupting chemicals; these compounds, which include chemicals used in the production of pesticides, plastics and gasoline, interfere with human reproduction and metabolism and cause cancer, thyroid problems and nervous-system disorders. In the last five years, however, a new wave of endocrinology research has found that even extremely low doses of such chemicals can create significant health problems. Among the Madrid scientists\u2019 recommendations: \u2018\u2018Enact legislation to require only essential uses of PFASs\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2018Whenever possible, avoid products containing, or manufactured using, PFASs. These include many products that are stain-resistant, waterproof or nonstick.\u2019\u2019 \n\n\n\nWhen asked about the Madrid Statement, Dan Turner, DuPont\u2019s head of global media relations, wrote in an email: \u2018\u2018DuPont does not believe the Madrid Statement reflects a true consideration of the available data on alternatives to long-chain perfluorochemicals, such as PFOA. DuPont worked for more than a decade, with oversight from regulators, to introduce its alternatives. Extensive data has been developed, demonstrating that these alternatives are much more rapidly eliminated from the body than PFOA, and have improved health safety profiles. We are confident that these alternative chemistries can be used safely \u2014 they are well characterized, and the data has been used to register them with environmental agencies around the world.\u2019\u2019 \n\n\n\nEvery year Rob\u00a0Bilott writes a letter to the E.P.A. and the West Virginia D.E.P., urging the regulation of PFOA in drinking water. In 2009, the E.P.A. set a \u2018\u2018provisional\u2019\u2019 limit of 0.4 parts per billion for short-term exposure, but has never finalized that figure. This means that local water districts are under no obligation to tell customers whether PFOA is in their water. In response to Bilott\u2019s most recent letter, the E.P.A. claimed that it would announce a \u2018\u2018lifetime health advisory level for PFOA\u2019\u2019 by \u2018\u2018early 2016.\u2019\u2019 \n\n\n\nThis advisory level, if indeed announced, might be a source of comfort to future generations. But if you are a sentient being reading this article in 2016, you already have PFOA in your blood. It is in your parents\u2019 blood, your children\u2019s blood, your lover\u2019s blood. How did it get there? Through the air, through your diet, through your use of nonstick cookware, through your umbilical cord. Or you might have drunk tainted water. The Environmental Working Group has found manufactured fluoro\u00adchemicals present in 94 water districts across 27 states (see sidebar beginning on Page 38). Residents of Issaquah, Wash.; Wilmington, Del.; Colorado Springs; and Nassau County on Long Island are among those whose water has a higher concentration of fluorochemicals than that in some of the districts included in Rob Bilott\u2019s class-action suit. The drinking water in Parkersburg itself, whose water district was not included in the original class-action suit and has failed to compel DuPont to pay for a filtration system, is currently tainted with high levels of PFOA. Most residents appear not to know this. \n\n\n\nWhere scientists have tested for the presence of PFOA in the world, they have found it. PFOA is in the blood or vital organs of Atlantic salmon, swordfish, striped mullet, gray seals, common cormorants, Alaskan polar bears, brown pelicans, sea turtles, sea eagles, Midwestern bald eagles, California sea lions and Laysan albatrosses on Sand Island, a wildlife refuge on Midway Atoll, in the middle of the North Pacific Ocean, about halfway between North America and Asia. \n\n\n\n\u2018\u2018We see a situation,\u2019\u2019 Joe Kiger says, \u2018\u2018that has gone from Washington Works, to statewide, to the United States, and now it\u2019s everywhere, it\u2019s global. We\u2019ve taken the cap off something here. But it\u2019s just not DuPont. Good God. There are 60,000 unregulated chemicals out there right now. We have no idea what we\u2019re taking.\u2019\u2019 \n\n\n\nBilott doesn\u2019t regret fighting DuPont for the last 16 years, nor for letting PFOA consume his career. But he is still angry. \u2018\u2018The thought that DuPont could get away with this for this long,\u2019\u2019 Bilott says, his tone landing halfway between wonder and rage, \u2018\u2018that they could keep making a profit off it, then get the agreement of the governmental agencies to slowly phase it out, only to replace it with an alternative with unknown human effects \u2014 we told the agencies about this in 2001, and they\u2019ve essentially done nothing. That\u2019s 14 years of this stuff continuing to be used, continuing to be in the drinking water all over the country. DuPont just quietly switches over to the next substance. And in the meantime, they fight everyone who has been injured by it.\u2019\u2019 \n\n\n\nBilott is currently prosecuting Wolf v. DuPont, the second of the personal-injury cases filed by the members of his class. The plaintiff, John M. Wolf of Parkersburg, claims that PFOA in his drinking water caused him to develop ulcerative colitis. That trial begins in March. When it concludes, there will be 3,533 cases left to try.Correction:\u00a0Jan. 24, 2016 \n\n\n\nAn article on Jan 10. about legal action against DuPont for chemical pollution referred incorrectly to DuPont\u2019s response in the 1970s when the company discovered high concentrations of PFOA in the blood of workers at Washington Works, a DuPont factory. DuPont withheld the information from the E.P.A., not from its workers. The article also misstated the year DuPont agreed to a $16.5 million settlement with the E.P.A. It was 2005, not 2006. In addition, the article misidentified the water district where a resident received a letter from the district noting that PFOA had been detected in the drinking water. It was Lubeck, W.Va. \u2014 not Little Hocking, Ohio. The article also misidentified the district where water tested positive for PFOA at seven times the limit. It was Little Hocking, not Lubeck. And the article misidentified the city in Washington State that has fluorochemicals in its drink-ing water. It is Issaquah, not Seattle. \n\n\n\nNathaniel Rich is a contributing writer for the New York Times magazine  and the author of \u2018\u2018Odds Against Tomorrow.\u2019\u2019 He lives in New Orleans and is a frequent contributor to The New York Review of Books and The Atlantic. \n\n\n\nYou find the original article here!",

                "title": "Madrid Under Snow!",
                "text": "I only like snow in my fantasies. I\u2019ve written books with and have had waking dreams that involved fireplaces, hot chocolate, and thick snowfall. Most of the time, my characters were inside of course, enjoying said hot beverage, warm rooms, and sometimes, heated embraces. Only once in a while did these characters actually head out into the icy white stuff and risk getting frostbite making snow angels and trying to give loved ones concussions with tightly packed snowballs. So as it is in fiction, it is for me in real life. I am from Jamaica, after all. \n\n\n\nThis is a street. For cars.\n\n\n\nBut when something like snowfall doesn\u2019t happen that often\u2014whether it\u2019s once every 50 years in Madrid or annually for about a day or two in Atlanta\u2014it has a certain appeal. So, with inadequate gloves and questionable snow boots on, I headed out into the aftermath of 2 days\u2019 worth of steady snowfall (two feet accumulated, I think) to see what the storm Filomena had left behind. It was fun for a few minutes. Like the kids and some adults, I threw snowballs, fell backwards into fresh blankets of snow, even built a sad little snow person. \n\n\n\nThen it was over. \n\n\n\nSnow play.\n\n\n\nDown to the last spoonful of pre-ground coffee, a single swish of mouthwash in the bottle, and barely enough milk to make one very necessary cup of snow-day hot chocolate, I had to leave the house for non-fun purposes. Off to the nearby market I went. And it was the epitome of anti-fun. On the whole way to the store, I had to keep a tight grip on the railing separating the walkway from traffic. Otherwise, I\u2019d end up falling on the ice and land myself in the ER like so many people have all across the region. It\u2019s been like a plague of the snow-fallen, apparently. Between the people who\u2019ve wiped out on the ice and the actual plague of covid-19, the emergency rooms are getting ridiculous. \n\n\n\nFallen tree in the path.\n\n\n\nWhen I finally made it to the grocery store, it was a wasteland. Nary a veg except a bag of cucumbers, one green tomato cracked and bleeding on the display, and a scattering of dodgy looking avocados. The fruit situation was equally dire and there were absolutely no eggs to be found anywhere. They\u2019d even bought out the batch of annoyingly tiny quail eggs people rarely have any use for when cooking \u201cregular\u201d meals. Luckily for me, there was plenty of coffee, Listerine, and lactose-free semi-skimmed milk. \n\n\n\nOn the way to the store, I\u2019d noticed that I was the only one walking on my side of the street so, taking the hint, I checked out the opposite side for the return trip. Sure enough, the sun had melted some of the ice and left slush behind in many places instead of an impromptu skating rink. Still, it was chilly and wet and treacherous walking due to some downed trees and drifts of snow glowing yellow with (hopefully) animal urine. I was officially over the snowstorm. \n\n\n\ncold!\n\n\n\nNow, I\u2019m inside again. It was -6 degrees Celsius when I woke up and the snow person someone built near the building\u2019s entrance two days ago still looks pretty healthy. Seems like a good day to stay inside and work. I\u2019ll leave the winter fantasies to the kids still playing in the stubborn snow outside. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPS \u2013 I\u2019ve finally picked a winner for a copy of my book Femme Like Her, but was having so much fun pressing \u201cchoose winner\u201d that I picked three!",

                "text": "Our niece, Lisa, and family, who live in Madrid, Spain January 14, 2021 - Thursday morning 26 degrees/cloudy/calm winds Pentoga Road Lisa shared a few photos of a very rare snowfall that has shut down Madrid and much of Spain. In a city where palm trees are more common than inclement winter weather, two feet of freshly fallen snow has brought Spain's largest city to a halt.  Still, that didn't stop the family from enjoying a rare wintertime treat, one that we take for granted here in the Upper Peninsula.  Back in the much more mundane UP, the place that has less snow on the ground than Madrid, Spain, I enjoyed Wednesday morning's walk.  After several days of dark, gloomy, weather, the sun shone brightly making the world on Pentoga Road sparkle.  In not so happy news, Sargie and I were saddened to hear of the passing of Larry the Heavy Equipment Guy. You may remember that Larry did our landscaping last summer and we became fond of the quiet, yet friendly and gentle man. Larry was employed by the county and I'm told he was flagging traffic north of town when he was hit by a passing vehicle. According to the news, he died on scene.\u00a0 Larry lived only a mile away and we considered him a neighbor. Our hearts are heavy as we come to grips that the world has lost a good soul.\u00a0 I wonder why bad things happen to good people, but then something I was told long ago comes to mind when questioning God's grace.\u00a0 He doesn't promise the outcome of our daily living, only that He'll be here for us when we need Him.\u00a0 We're going to miss you Larry.  We enjoyed our daily drive on Wednesday and visited several of the area lakes. In no real hurry of any kind, we putted along several rural roads, talking, looking, and enjoying the day. Back home, I changed into my ice fishing clothes, filled the four wheeler with fuel, and headed to the lake.  I reeled in one smallmouth bass, but that was it. As Dad used to say, all I really caught was a whole lot of fresh air, but it was all worth while. The temperature was nearing 40 with lots of sunshine and no wind.  I wanted to work in the shop at some point yesterday, so after a couple of hours on the ice, I returned home. More work was done on the segmented bowl, gluing more rings, practicing cuts for segmented pieces, and a pattern glued onto wood for my latest scroll saw project of my favorite breed of canine, a big, fat, ugly, bulldog.  You might ask how my superior mathematic skills fared in calculating the angles for a segmented ring.\u00a0  You know, the pie are squared and all that good stuff. Well, I'm still \"cyphering\". Seems I ran out of fingers and toes on which to count so today, I'm adding popsicle\u00a0sticks.\u00a0 All labor will be halted this afternoon when I venture to Eric the Dentist to have a top wisdom tooth pulled. Seems as I get older, tired of imparting quite so many deep thoughts, my wisdom teeth have decided to either flake, crack, or decay away. Eric wanted to pull this one a year ago, but being a serious, sound, academic, I wanted to hold onto what few brains I have left, even if they come in the form of a lowly tooth. After all, a man's work is never done. So are the tales from Pentoga Road...  The grass covered Maple Street in bustling downtown Pentoga Village, population 2.",

Like the post office, neither rain nor sleet nor dark of night will deter these heroic men and women from their mission of making the streets safe again for Scientology\u2019s fellow man. \nUm. \nNo. \nMore realistically, charity begins at home and a closer examination of the photos on the slideshow reveal a slightly more selfish reality. \nRather than heading out into the city to lend their charitable aid to an overburdened transportation department, the Scientology Volunteer Ministers did not wander far from their own doorstep. \n \nComparing the photos from Scientology\u2019s video with Google Earth one discovers that the Volunteer Ministers produced this photo op literally right outside the Madrid Scientology building. \n \nLike the Seattle street cleanup from earlier in 2020, rather than being out where they might actually do the most good for their neighbors, the VMs were working solely to benefit Scientology. \nOne can\u2019t help but wonder just how long the VMs were out in the cold and snow but thankfully they were not far from their own front door when they needed to warm up. \nThanks to @Princess Persephone for bringing this to our attention.",

Most of the offenders were ordered to pay an admission of guilt fine,\u00a0the privately owned NewZimbvbawe.com website reported. A hard lockdown came into force on 5 January after cases doubled last month because of festive season gatherings and traffic from neighbouring South Africa, which is experiencing a severe second wave of the virus. The highest number of daily deaths from coronavirus - 38 - were recorded on Wednesday. Currently more than 9,000 people have Covid-19. The surge in cases has threatened to overwhelm health services, and health care workers have been hit by a shortage of protective gear as they battle to cope with an increase in the number of patients,\u00a0the state-owned Herald newspaper reports. Healthcare workers have been hit by shortages of adequate personal protective equipment (PPE) as the number of patients increases. In total, there have been more than 34,000 Covid-19 cases and almost 600 deaths since the first case was detected in March.

Souleymane Cond\u00e9 and Youssouf Dioubat\u00e9 were also fined 20m Guinean francs ($1900:\u00a31300) each. They were arrested in September 2020 during protests against President Alpha Cond\u00e9's bid for a third term and accused of producing, disseminating and making available data likely to disturb public order and security. The prosecutor said the pair had called for the arrest of President Cond\u00e9 and had accused the authorities of murdering children. The defendants denied making such statements. Mr Cond\u00e9 and Mr Dioubate had already spent four months in prison. Their lawyers said they will appeal against the verdict.

They included Pyotr Verzilov, a member of the feminist punk band Pussy Riot and the publisher of the MediaZona news site, and prominent blogger Ilya Varlamov. Before going to South Sudan, the travellers had been touring in Uganda, where Mr Varlamov\u2019s drone was confiscated - but not its remote control, which remained in his luggage. When their bags were searched at Kapoeta airport, where they were due to take a plane to South Sudan\u2019s capital, Juba, security officials demanded to know the location of the drone when they found the remote. Most African countries have strict laws either banning or restricting the use of drones. Attempts to explain that they didn\u2019t have the drone fell on deaf ears, and the group were hauled off to a ramshackle room where they were placed under arrest. But the group insisted on keeping their phones so they could contact their embassy and others for help - and tweeted and blogged about their day. Social embed from instagramReportReport this social embed, make a complaintAs they kicked their heels in the heat waiting for the misunderstanding to be resolved, Mr Varlamov posted photos of their cell, counting 43 hornet nests and many spiders.

According to Mr Varlamov\u2019s blog, an army general apologised to them and for the treatment of their guide, who says he was tortured to find out more about the drone. It was with relief that they were able to drink some beer afterwards - as they tried to work out how to get to Juba as their plane had long gone.

It\u2019s the latest in a wave of kidnappings in the region. The gunmen on motorbikes stormed Mando village in Birnin Gwari area in the early hours of Wednesday. Residents say the abductees were taken to a bush. The attackers also looted food items from the village. A police spokesperson told the BBC that they\u2019re investigating the incident. It\u2019s not clear who carried out the attack but kidnapping for ransom is rampant across Nigeria - particularly in that region. Last month gunmen abducted more than 300 schoolboys from their dormitory in neighbouring Katsina state. They were later released following days of negotiations. Despite the deployment of thousands of troops, criminal gangs continue to carry out attacks in the region.

The current Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte now has to find a way to prop up his coalition. Germany\u2019s\u00a0public health agency has reported a new daily high of 1,244 deaths in a 24-hour period. The south-western state of Bavaria will next week try to reduce the spread of cases by requiring shoppers or anyone going on public transport to wear an FFP2 facemask, which is both thicker and more expensive. The\u00a0Dutch\u00a0cabinet is considering imposing a first Covid curfew to reduce the spread of the virus. A lockdown was imposed last month but a 20:00 to 04:00 ban on movement could come into effect from the weekend, particularly with the aim of stopping young people moving around. Tight curfews are already in place in 25 areas of\u00a0France, beginning as early as 18:00, and French ministers will consider later whether that should be extended. Prime Minister Jean Castex will reveal the latest strategy at 17:00 GMT today. Spain\u00a0last night registered a record 38.869 new infections in 24 hours \u2013 53% higher than the day before. The Balearic Islands, Extremadura and Madrid are among the areas with high rates of infection. Heavy snow has added to the crisis in recent days, with staffing problems and increased medical emergencies.
