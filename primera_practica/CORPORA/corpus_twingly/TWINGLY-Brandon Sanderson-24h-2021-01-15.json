                "text": "Welcome to The Friday Face-Off, a weekly meme created by\u00a0Books by Proxy! Each Friday, we will pit cover against cover while also taking the opportunity to showcase gorgeous artwork and feature some of our favorite book covers. If you want to join the fun, simply choose a book each Friday that fits that week\u2019s predetermined theme, post and compare two or more different covers available for that book, then name your favorite. A list of future weeks\u2019 themes are available at\u00a0Lynn\u2019s Book Blog. \nThis week\u2019s theme is: \n~ a cover featuring\u00a0AN AERIAL ENCOUNTER \nMogsy\u2019s Pick:\nSkyward by Brandon Sanderson\nSkyward\u00a0by Brandon Sanderson, a book that is\u00a0all\u00a0about aerial encounters. In Spensa\u2019s world, everyone has heard of the heroic achievements of the Defiant Defense Force in the Battle of Alta\u2014the battle in which forty pilots protected their planet Detritus from the alien Krell attack.\u00a0Except in Spensa\u2019s case, her father was known as the pilot who ran, shot down in disgrace for trying to abandon the fight. Now Spensa lives with the stain of that disgrace, but being a pilot has always been her greatest desire. Despite efforts to keep her out, she manages to make it into Flight School, more determined than ever to be come a full-fledged pilot for the DDF even with the deck stacked against her. \nGiven the story and its themes, I\u2019m actually surprised there aren\u2019t more\u00a0covers for this book featuring aerial encounters, but I did find some. Let\u2019s take a look at this week\u2019s competition: \nFrom left to right: \nDelacrote Press (2018) \u2013 Gollancz (2018) \n  \nPolish Edition (2019) \u2013 Bulgarian Edition (2019) \u2013 Turkish Edition (2020) \n   \nItalian Edition (2019) \u2013 Russian Edition (2020) \n  \nGerman Edition (2021) \u2013 French Edition (2020) \u2013 Estonian Edition (2020) \n   \nWinner\nI\u2019ve always love the cover to the UK (Gollancz) edition of this book, and while there were a bunch of new ones here I hadn\u2019t seen before, nothing quite came close to unseating it. \nBut what do you think? Which one is your favorite?",

                "text": "Hey there! Welcome to a brand new year, and my very first post of 2021. I can\u2019t believe it\u2019s already mid January, time really does fly. Today, I\u2019ll be sharing my completed reading list for 2020. It wasn\u2019t the best of reading years for me, but it wasn\u2019t the worst either. When I compiled my list I realized I\u2019d actually read more than I thought, and even surpassed the previous year\u2019s record, (by the skin of my teeth). I tried to include a wider variety of genres, but of course, fantasy and sci-fi won out for the most reads. I had pretty good luck with the non-fiction reads I chose, but as for fiction, most of the books I read weren\u2019t great. With the exception of a few, it seemed like most of the novels I picked up last year were just average, and didn\u2019t capture my attention. Which led me to feel very uninspired about my TBR. But looking back, it turned out to be a rather decent reading year, despite my lack of enthusiasm. \n\n\n\nNow let\u2019s get to the list: \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRatings: 1-5  \n\n\n\nFavorites in bold \n\n\n\nNon-Fiction \n\n\n\nThe Universe Next Door, by James W.

He sets out all alone on a journey through the wilds, and has many curious encounters with some very odd characters. This is a Middle-Grade book, but it can be read and enjoyed by anyone looking for an adventure. The storyline was very original, and I was surprised to find out that it was not a modern publication, but was published over twenty years ago.  \n\n\n\nThe Scorpio Races, by Maggie Steifvater \n\n\n\nTaking place on the small, windswept, isle of Thisby, we follow Puck Connolly, and Sean Kendrick as they prepare for The Scorpio Races. A yearly event where racers compete for a grand prize\u2014and sometimes to the death\u2014atop the violent, and wild, water horses called, capaill uisce. This book had me staying up late into the night, and reading for hours to reach the end. I actually found this book at a thrift store a few years ago, and left it sitting untouched on my bookshelf for so long! I\u2019m happy that I finally got around to reading it. I loved everything about this book, and I think it\u2019s my favorite book of the entire year. \n\n\n\nParanormia, by Paul Regnier \n\n\n\nChris Loury is young, broke, and kind of a nerd. Struggling to find his way in life, and hoping to land a contract for his original comic, he ends up in a strange accident. After that fateful night, he is swept into a series of wild encounters, and has several run-ins with a lunatic who claims to be an angel. But as events unfold, and Chris finds himself digging deeper into trouble, he starts to believe the lunatic is actually who\u2013or rather what he says he is. I appreciated the way the supernatural elements were handled in this story, and I thought Chris was a very relatable character, especially to all of my fellow twenty-something\u2019s out there, who are trying to make their own way in the world. Overall, a solid read. \n\n\n\nThe Scent of Water, by Elizabeth Goudge \n\n\n\nThe perfect, cozy British tale to curl up with under a blanket, and a cup of tea. This story centers around Mary, a woman who retires to a small English village, and becomes acquainted with the inhabitants there. Learning to love the quiet of the countryside, Mary also finds herself becoming involved in the many joys, and heartaches with her new neighbors. This was one of the few books I was actually sad to finish. I\u2019ll likely be reading more books, by Miss Goudge in the future. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMost Disappointing: \n\n\n\nUnpopular opinion here: I was actually very disappointed in, A Time to Die, by Nadine Brandes. I\u2019d read so many great reviews of this book, (and I enjoyed her other books,) but after reading, A Time to Die I don\u2019t really get the hype. For starters, it felt sort of like two books squashed into one, with so much going on. I never connected with the main character, Parvin, and I thought it a little unrealistic how much trauma she went through, and still survived. (Though that was kind of the point of the story.) In general, there were many aspects of the story that I found very unrealistic, and slightly annoying. I wanted to like this book, but I just couldn\u2019t, and as of right now I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll continue with the series.  \n\n\n\nTo Sleep in a Sea of Stars, by Christopher Paolini \n\n\n\nFirstly, I loved the cover, and this title is exactly what I like to see from sci-fi novels. I was a big fan of the Inheritance Cycle, by Paolini, but unfortunately I didn\u2019t love this book. This is not a YA book, nor does it pretend to be, but I felt like I went into it a little blind. Especially for younger Paolini fans, I\u2019d warn them about the amount of profanity, and adult themes throughout. It was an interesting story, and read like any space epic, but, I didn\u2019t find it out of this world fantastic. Die-hard sci-fi fans would probably enjoy this book, but I\u2019m not adding it to my favorites list. Also, it\u2019s nearly 900 hundred pages, so beware. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThus concludes my list, and a few reviews, for all the books I cracked open during the year 2020. I may have forgotten a few, since I didn\u2019t keep track very well. There were also a few DNF\u2019s (Did Not Finish), throughout the year which I didn\u2019t list here, but that\u2019s for the best. This year I\u2019m hoping to read more, since I feel like I\u2019m finally in a good reading mood, but then again I say that every year, and things don\u2019t always pan out. I would like to continue to expand genres, and read more non-fiction. And in general, just read outside of my comfort zone, because I feel a bit like I\u2019ve read those genres dry, and I know I\u2019ll find some new, unexpected favorites, if I\u2019d only look to new avenues. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat about you? How many books did you read in 2020? What was your favorite read of the year? Leave me a comment, and let me know! \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nThanks for reading, \n\n\n\nLady S",

                "text": "bridgefourisgayrights: if-one-of-us-falls: \n\nbridgefourisgayrights: moash: \n\nmoash: moash: moash: \n\ndo we think whatever blinded moash that couldn\u2019t be healed was physical or spiritual? do his eyes look different, considering how important eye color is to him/society? speaking of eyes, did bonding the honorblade give him lighteyes again? i mean it does right?   \n\n\ni have more thoughts about this but i need to get my phd in investiture before i elaborate, remind me to comment on this in three years  \nok so i do want to learn more about investiture before i commit to this line of reasoning, but thoughts on this theory: there\u2019s nothing special about the wound itself, he\u2019s just subconsciously not healing his eyes, the way kaladin subconsciously didn\u2019t heal his scars like first, moash is a character that\u2019s literally just a bunch of parallels to kaladin in a trenchcoat. like he exists to be a dark mirror to kaladin. second, kaladin didn\u2019t heal his scars with stormlight bc subconsciously they were representative of his past that he couldn\u2019t let go of. he\u2019s able to heal them when he\u2019s started to take steps towards setting down that burden and healing. for moash to suffer a wound he can\u2019t heal from in the same battle? parallels. moash was sitting w his feelings for a while before the singers found him and his whole problem is he doesn\u2019t want to think about the things he\u2019s done, he doesn\u2019t want to look at his past. kaladin couldn\u2019t set his pain down, moash can\u2019t bear to look at his.  the reason i want to know more about investiture before i commit to this is that i can\u2019t think of, based on my limited knowledge, a reason why he couldn\u2019t heal from this. storm/voidlight have so far healed every single non fatal wound, even shardblade wounds that sever the soul from the body. maybe a reason exists, but i don\u2019t know enough to say, and i probably favor this kind of theory bc i\u2019m fond of moash as a character. hit me w ur thoughts  \nlike not for nothing, but moash also didn\u2019t heal his bridge four tattoo, which we know is possible bc kaladin healed his tattoos (granted, very soon after he got them). moash instead wears shirts w sleeves that cover it, when he could just heal it. sub con scious !  \n\n\nSo I\u2019m a thousand years late to this but anyway you\u2019re absolutely onto something. I have a minor in Investiture and I hope I can explain just how right you are. Healing in the Cosmere works through an aspect of Investiture called Identity. Identity is the individual self, the self as differentiated from others, and all the things that come with that: personality, lowercase i identity, etc. Identity, for example, is why Feruchemists on Scadrial can\u2019t use another Feruchemist\u2019s metalmind. It\u2019s why Awakeners on Nalthis can put their Breath in objects but another Awakener can\u2019t take it out\u2014like, for example, say Kaladin somehow knew Awakener commands, he couldn\u2019t have got breaths from the pieces of cloth Zahel Awakened. However, if Zahel *did* give his Breath to Kaladin, the Breaths would take on Kaladin\u2019s identity, and be his. A more relevant example is the Singers\u2019 slaveform: the binding of Ba-Ado-Mishram stole their Identity, which is why none of them remember life before enslavement. That Bondsmith fundamentally found a way to *steal their very selves*, which is why the Radiants went \u201cOh no we\u2019re the bad guys.\u201d Healing is a connection (lowercase c) between a person\u2019s Spiritual (ideal, or true, self) self and their Physical self, filtered through their self perception, or their Cognitive self. This is why Lopen could heal an old injury, but Kaladin couldn\u2019t heal his scars. Sanderson does a good job saying that the ideal self isn\u2019t necessary the *best* or *optimal* self: the implication across the Cosmere is that *nobody knows what lies beyond the Spiritual Realm. A person is free to define themselves however they want without some big spiritual entity saying they have to be someone, while still following hard magic system rules. An important line I found fact checking is that \u201ceven if a wound is recent, if thr person has changed their mindset to see it as part of themselves, they will not be able to heal from it.\u201d Stormlight can heal Shardblade wounds because healing comes from the Spiritual self, or where the soul fundamentally is. There are a thousand different theories on what the hell was going on with Renarin\u2019s image, but we all agree the mystery is around Moash\u2014it definitely wasn\u2019t Renarin\u2019s perception of him. I honestly wasn\u2019t thinking and assumed it was some kind of Magic Wound\u2122, BUT, if it wasn\u2019t healed, it would absolutely imply something about the way he sees himself. I\u2019ve also wondered if it\u2019s not just a coping mechanism, but like\u2026 my words have run out but like a way to sort of put him out of the fight. Maybe parallels to Jezrien, who went blind despite the Herald\u2019s healing because of his guilt for abandoning humanity (I don\u2019t think he\u2019ll end up like that, but another example of that happening). I hope that makes sense!! I just love this character too and I wanted to say how right you were. \n@bridgefourisgayrights thanks for the detailed Identity explanation, I\u2019ve been trying to wrap my brain around it!  I definitely agree with this line of reasoning. I also love how well the parallels to Kaladin line up.  I want to bring up an additional detail - the cause of that wound. Specifically Towerlight.   Earlier in Navani\u2019s POV, we saw Moash freeze in place when Navani sang the anti-Voidlight tone. This is understandable because it probably cut off/ weakened his Connection to Odium. (On a sidenote, I wonder if in that moment he experienced what Kaladin experiences when he freezes). Later, though, when the Towerlight hits him, he runs away. Again his Connection to Odium is severed (because the tower\u2019s protections have been fixed) and it takes him a few paragraphs to realize that he\u2019s been blinded. Honestly I\u2019m not even sure of the exact moment he has been blinded because his narrative is so frenzied and unclear at this point. My guess is that it\u2019s right when he exits the tower, when the light catches up to him and \u201cburns\u201d him. Anyway he runs away, same as after Renarin\u2019s illusion, which makes me think even more that Renarin used something other than Stormlight. I also just remembered that in the clinic, Teft describes Moash as being in shadow despite the room\u2019s many spheres. I wonder if it\u2019s just a thematic choice or something more tangible. It\u2019s a bit of a stretch but it reminds me a little of the palace in Kholinar being constantly in shadow because of the influence of the Unmade. I think it was Ashertmarn who caused it but it could be Yelig-Nar. \n\n\nOoo very interesting addition! I also realized that Honorblades can\u2019t heal Shardblade wounds. I wonder if that means the Towerlight damage, like you said, is somehow linked to his Connection to Odium, and is deeper than Physical Realm damage. Not really plot relevant\u2014unless it leads to a plot where fully breaking from Odium or maybe bonding with a true spren will heal him, if Sanderson goes there\u2014but interesting Realmatically.",

                "title": "Top 10: Lecturas de 2020",
                "text": "\u00bfQu\u00e9 podemos decir de 2020 que no se haya dicho ya? Supongo que una de las opiniones m\u00e1s extendidas es \u00ab\u00a1Menos mal que por fin se ha terminado!\u00bb, pero\u2026 \u00bfhasta qu\u00e9 punto significa eso algo? \u00bfAcaso eso nos garantiza que se avecinen tiempos mejores? \n\n\n\nAun as\u00ed, la sensaci\u00f3n de cambio y de empezar de cero que trae el nuevo a\u00f1o es innegable. Y siempre es m\u00e1s sano mantener un cierto optimismo y pensar que, con lo feo que fue el anterior, este no puede ser mucho peor. Aunque reconozco que yo no tengo tanto de lo que quejarme como otras personas. \n\n\n\nVolver la vista atr\u00e1s siempre es una buena forma de cerrar un cap\u00edtulo y dar la bienvenida al siguiente. Y, como no todo ha sido malo en 2020, es hora de dedicarle un peque\u00f1o espacio a una de las cosas buenas de este \u00faltimo a\u00f1o: mis lecturas favoritas. Me ha sido muy dif\u00edcil establecer una verdadera clasificaci\u00f3n y no acabo de estar segura al cien por cien de algunos puestos, pero me hac\u00eda ilusi\u00f3n dejaros un peque\u00f1o Top 10, como siempre de menos a m\u00e1s. \n\n\n\nPuesto 10: Nimona (Noelle Stevenson)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPor desgracia, no pude prestar tanta atenci\u00f3n a esta novela gr\u00e1fica como habr\u00eda deseado, pues fue mi \u00ablibro de los fines de semana\u00bb. Aclaraci\u00f3n: vivo entre dos localidades y continuamente transporto ropa y otros utensilios entre una y otra, pero prefiero tener la mayor\u00eda de libros en el que considero mi verdadero hogar; por lo tanto, suelo llevarme un \u00fanico libro a la otra casa y leerlo entre semana, mientras que los fines de semana, que tengo menos tiempo, cojo alguno de la estanter\u00eda, normalmente colecciones de relatos o lecturas m\u00e1s peque\u00f1as y ligeras. \n\n\n\nDespu\u00e9s de esta desviaci\u00f3n, vamos a lo interesante: mis impresiones de Nimona. Ten\u00eda muchas ganas de leer este libro porque lo hab\u00eda visto recomendado en varias ocasiones y porque la descripci\u00f3n promet\u00eda muchas de mis cosas favoritas: \u00a1dragones! \u00a1Archienemigos! \u00a1Cambiaformas! \u00a1Humor! En efecto, su protagonista es una joven con muchas ganas de hacer maldades y la habilidad de transformarse en toda clase de criaturas que comienza a trabajar como ayudante de un supervillano. Siempre me han llamado la atenci\u00f3n las historias desde el punto de vista de los \u00abmalos\u00bb e incomprendidos y, como yo sospechaba, hay momentos en los que Lord Blackheart se acaba convirtiendo m\u00e1s bien en un h\u00e9roe oscuro al que se le coge mucho cari\u00f1o. Tambi\u00e9n encontramos muchos momentos c\u00f3micos y alguna que otra relaci\u00f3n con potencial de shippeo (once a fanficker, always a fanficker). Los dibujos y la fuente en la que est\u00e1n escritos los textos parecen mal hechos adrede, como si los hubiera pintado un ni\u00f1o, lo cual les da mucha simpat\u00eda. Sin \u00e1nimo de hacer spoilers, el final es algo triste o agridulce y quiz\u00e1s sea lo \u00fanico que no me termin\u00f3 de gustar, pues rompe con el tono juguet\u00f3n y un tanto absurdo de la novela. \n\n\n\nPuesto 9: The Prince and the Dressmaker (Jen Wang)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDe nuevo, una novela gr\u00e1fica, pero muy distinta de la anterior. Entre las tres que escog\u00ed para explorar este g\u00e9nero es la \u00fanica que no contiene elementos de fantas\u00eda y, tal vez por eso, era la que menos me atra\u00eda. Me interes\u00e9 por ella porque era una de las m\u00e1s recomendadas para un p\u00fablico joven \u2014no s\u00e9 si ya coment\u00e9 que uno de los motivos por los que decid\u00ed dar una oportunidad a las novelas gr\u00e1ficas era para poder compartirlas con mis alumnes\u2014 y porque trataba temas sobre identidad de g\u00e9nero. He de decir que me sorprendi\u00f3 muy gratamente. \n\n\n\nEst\u00e9ticamente es una verdadera preciosidad a pesar de su aparente sencillez. Si te gusta ver vestidos bonitos y originales, te lo pasar\u00e1s pipa con esta novela. La trama es muy tierna y esperanzadora, si bien tiene algo de drama: trata de una joven modista que ans\u00eda la fama entre la alta sociedad y un pr\u00edncipe lleno de inseguridades que disfruta adoptando una identidad femenina. No termina de quedar claro si Sebastian, que as\u00ed se llama, es una mujer trans o si fluct\u00faa entre el g\u00e9nero femenino y el masculino, pero eso es lo de menos. Lo mejor es la amistad entre sus protagonistas y, aunque tal vez la historia peque de demasiado optimista, de tanto en tanto necesitamos algo que nos deje con una sonrisa o alguna que otra lagrimilla de alegr\u00eda. \n\n\n\nPuesto 8: Elantris (Brandon Sanderson)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLlevaba queriendo leer a Sanderson desde que lo conoc\u00ed en el Celsius. Primero compr\u00e9 Alcatraz contra los bibliotecarios malvados, cuyo narrador me result\u00f3 muy simp\u00e1tico. Sin embargo, la historia no termin\u00f3 de engancharme, as\u00ed que decid\u00ed probar con algo m\u00e1s adulto. Elantris fue mi elecci\u00f3n, pues muchas personas hablaban maravillas de esta novela y se me ocurri\u00f3 que ser\u00eda mejor iniciarse con un libro que no formase parte de una saga. Ah, y porque me gustaba c\u00f3mo sonaba el t\u00edtulo. \n\n\n\nUna de las cosas que me hab\u00edan llamado la atenci\u00f3n era que se tratase de una historia de fantas\u00eda sin viajes, en la que todo ocurre en un mismo lugar\u2026, aunque ese lugar fuera una especie de prisi\u00f3n para zombis. Para mi gusto, es una novela muy larga y lenta, por lo que se me hizo algo cuesta arriba. \u00bfLa parte buena? Sus tres protagonistas: un pr\u00edncipe ca\u00eddo en desgracia que no pierde su optimismo y sus ganas de luchar, una princesa valiente y astuta y un fan\u00e1tico religioso que sufre una crisis de fe. Este \u00faltimo, adem\u00e1s, tiene uno de esos arcos de personaje de los que a m\u00ed me gustan. \u00a0 \n\n\n\nPuesto 7: Sue\u00f1o del Fevre (George R. R. Martin)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMartin no pod\u00eda faltar en un top hecho por m\u00ed. De los tres libros suyos que he le\u00eddo este a\u00f1o, Sue\u00f1o del Fevre ha sido mi favorito, aunque en un empate muy re\u00f1ido con algunos de los cuentos de Retratos de los hijos. Nunca me han atra\u00eddo demasiado los vampiros pero, por mucho que sus lectores describan esta novela como \u00abvampiros y barcos de vapor en el Mississippi\u00bb, es mucho m\u00e1s que eso. Martin nos muestra la relaci\u00f3n entre dos hombres que no podr\u00edan ser m\u00e1s diferentes, que empieza como una asociaci\u00f3n puramente comercial y termina convirti\u00e9ndose en una gran amistad, y la lucha de un capit\u00e1n de barco por cumplir sus sue\u00f1os y restaurar su reputaci\u00f3n. En ella encontramos muchas de las constantes de este autor: un protagonista feo y corpulento, misterio, escenas truculentas, gran presencia de la comida, damas de piel p\u00e1lida, cabello oscuro y hechiceros ojos de color violeta\u2026 \n\n\n\nPuesto 6: Mala Hierba (Andrea Arroyo del Campo)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00bfAmbientaci\u00f3n de fantas\u00eda medieval? \u00bfProtagonistas femeninas que hacen cosas? \u00bfIntrigas pol\u00edticas? \u00bfCambios de bando? En cuanto coincid\u00ed con su Andrea en nuestra presentaci\u00f3n conjunta, supe que tendr\u00eda que leerlo. Y que me gustar\u00eda. No me decepcion\u00f3 en absoluto. \n\n\n\nAnah\u00ed de Garland, una princesa heredera que se ve obligada a ejercer como brazo ejecutor de un tirano para poder salvar su vida, es una de las pocas protagonistas que me han conquistado desde las primeras p\u00e1ginas gracias a su humor, sus conflictos internos absolutamente realistas y su fortaleza. El que adem\u00e1s hubiera representaci\u00f3n LGBT+ y personas gato solo son a\u00f1adidos. Aqu\u00ed pod\u00e9is ver lo que la propia autora nos cuenta sobre la que ha sido su primera novela. \n\n\n\nMenciones honorables\n\n\n\nEste apartado es para algunas obras que se han quedado a las puertas de este ranking. Me averg\u00fcenza reconocer que, entre unas cosas y otras, casi est\u00e1 mi lista completa de lecturas de 2020 en esta entrada, pero ha habido un par de novelas que me han consumido demasiado tiempo y no me han permitido leer m\u00e1s. Sea como sea, estas son las candidatas. \u00a0 \n\n\n\n\u2014Saga de las reinas de Fennbirn (Kendare Blake): como ya coment\u00e9, tuve demasiados altibajos con esta tetralog\u00eda como para incluirla entre mis favoritas. Eso s\u00ed, la menci\u00f3n honorable se la merece aunque sea solo por todo el tiempo que me ha acompa\u00f1ado y entretenido. \n\n\n\n\u2014Baba Yaga\u2019s Assistant (Marika McCoola): una novela gr\u00e1fica muy simp\u00e1tica, pero tal vez demasiado corta. \n\n\n\n\u2014Retratos de los hijos (George R. R. Martin): ya sab\u00e9is que no me gusta repetir autores. Adem\u00e1s, as\u00ed como algunos relatos me impactaron, otros pasaron sin pena ni gloria. \n\n\n\nPuesto 5: El coraz\u00f3n de Ixchel (Varias autoras)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSi el gran problema de las antolog\u00edas unipersonales es que pueden resultar repetitivas debido a los \u00abfetiches\u00bb de su autore, el de las antolog\u00edas colectivas es que suelen tener muchos altibajos. No es el caso de El coraz\u00f3n de Ixchel. Prometo que no estoy haciendo la pelota a Ediciones Hati cuando digo que se merecen mi m\u00e1s sincera enhorabuena por la selecci\u00f3n. \n\n\n\nEl coraz\u00f3n de Ixchel me sorprendi\u00f3 gratamente porque, dentro de sus diferencias de estilo, todos los relatos presentan un gran nivel. Llegu\u00e9 a pensar que cada uno era a\u00fan mejor que el anterior. Tengo mis favoritos \u2014aqu\u00ed viene cuando hago sufrir a M. J. Ceruti una vez m\u00e1s al hablar de lo dolorosamente real que me result\u00f3 \u00abPish Taco\u00bb y c\u00f3mo con unas pocas p\u00e1ginas comprendemos perfectamente las relaciones entre los miembros de una peque\u00f1a familia y la personalidad de cada uno\u2014 y, en cambio, solo recuerdo un cuento que no me gust\u00f3 nada, pero creo que es porque su autora y yo simplemente no nos entendemos. \n\n\n\nPuesto 4: Saga de Kyoshi (F. C. Yee)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCualquier cosa que me permita regresar al universo de Avatar siempre ser\u00e1 bien recibida. Y m\u00e1s cuando se trata de uno de mis personajes secundarios favoritos: Avatar Kyoshi, la predecesora del Reino Tierra de Aang. En la serie me llamaba mucho la atenci\u00f3n por su peculiar est\u00e9tica y porque presentaba una personalidad completamente contraria a la de Aang: seria, firme y dispuesta a ser despiadada cuando la situaci\u00f3n lo requiere. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs\u00ed que, cuando descubr\u00ed que exist\u00eda una novela en dos partes centrada en sus or\u00edgenes, no pude resistirme. De modo similar a los arcos de redenci\u00f3n, hay un cierto encanto en las historias en las que un personaje pasa de cero a h\u00e9roe, como es el caso de nuestra protagonista: Kyoshi inicia su aventura como una hu\u00e9rfana hambrienta a la que rescatan de las calles para trabajar como sirvienta en la mansi\u00f3n del nuevo Avatar\u2026 hasta que se descubre que el verdadero Avatar es ella. A partir de ah\u00ed, somos testigos de su entrenamiento, sus peripecias con la banda de criminales a la que pertenec\u00edan sus padres, su primer amor, su trama de venganza contra el hombre que m\u00e1s da\u00f1o caus\u00f3 a sus seres queridos e incluso sus primeras intervenciones como figura pol\u00edtica. Y todo ello aderezado con batallas \u00e9picas de magia elemental, criaturas asombrosas y nuevos detalles acerca de ese mundo que quienes hemos visto la serie conocemos tan bien. \n\n\n\nPuesto 3: Momo (Michael Ende)\n\n\n\nUno de los pocos cl\u00e1sicos que, en mi opini\u00f3n, de verdad merecen su estatus. Para ser una novela juvenil, la trama tarda un poco en despegar, pero se le perdona porque la presentaci\u00f3n de los personajes es muy original y casi tan importante como la aventura que narra. Entre un sinf\u00edn de elementos fant\u00e1sticos y pasajes cargados de poes\u00eda, Ende nos plantea una serie de reflexiones sobre la sociedad moderna y una cr\u00edtica nada sutil al capitalismo, tan necesarias y relevantes hoy en d\u00eda como en el a\u00f1o 1973, cuando se public\u00f3 por primera vez. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPuesto 2: La canci\u00f3n secreta del mundo (Jos\u00e9 Antonio Cotrina)\n\n\n\nCon la cantidad de veces que he nombrado este libro, voy a tener que empezar a pedir a Cotrina que me d\u00e9 comisi\u00f3n. As\u00ed que, en vez de repetir lo que ya he dicho hasta la saciedad, os dejo con esta minirese\u00f1a de mi sis literaria, a la que parece que le gust\u00f3 tanto como a m\u00ed. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPuesto 1: Asesino de brujas: la bruja blanca (Shelby Mahurin)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEn Las l\u00e1grimas de los dioses, tenemos a un inquisidor y una bruja que se ven obligados a colaborar para salvar el mundo; aqu\u00ed, tenemos a un cazador de brujas y a una bruja a los que circunstancias de la vida les obligan a\u2026 \u00a1casarse! Con una premisa as\u00ed, no pod\u00eda perd\u00e9rmelo. Esta historia de amor envuelta en fantas\u00eda tiene una ambientaci\u00f3n que nos recuerda a la Francia prerrevolucionaria, con su fastuosidad y alg\u00fan que otro personaje hist\u00f3rico de inc\u00f3gnito. Si bien hay algunas fuerzas sobrenaturales que amenazan el reino, estas se mantienen ocultas y solo se manifiestan en alg\u00fan que otro golpe menor hasta la segunda mitad de la novela, lo cual, lejos de restarle emoci\u00f3n, nos permite conocer mejor a sus dos protagonistas, que estos se conozcan mejor entre ellos y que el romance florezca a fuego lento. Otros puntos fuertes son los momentos de alivio c\u00f3mico y su villana, tan carism\u00e1tica como temible.",

                "text": "Hello Kultists, let\u2019s see how my reading went this week. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEarlier this week I finished Look to Windward by Iain M. Banks. It was one of the pleasant reads of the Culture and even though not my personal favourite in series I believe it\u2019s one of Banks\u2019 best written ones. The worldbuilding as always was top notch and I loved the characters and the story. I also finished The Philosopher\u2019s Toolkit: A Compendium of Philosophical Concepts and Methods by Julian Baggini & Peter S. Fosl. The book was pretty dense but it did cover a lot of tools and concepts that any philosophy enthusiast will find useful and insightful.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlso, I started reading The Daily Stoic: 366 Meditations for Clarity, Effectiveness, and Serenity by Stephen Hanselman &\u00a0Ryan Holiday, since I\u2019ve been hearing a lot about it and some meditation guidance in the climate wouldn\u2019t hurt at all. It will be a long read since you\u2019re supposed to read one meditation per day so let\u2019s hope I manage to do it consistently and not DNF it after a month. Speaking of DNFs, I started reading Brave New World by Aldous Huxley last weekend but after about a third way through I just couldn\u2019t get through his writing, the story and premise were quite fascinating so I may try to listen to the audiobook sometime in the future. Lastly, I started reading The Gathering Storm by Brandon Sanderson & Robert Jordan. I\u2019m currently more than halfway through it and Sanderson gave a new breath of life to the series. The story is coming to an end and we finally start to unravel the conclusion of Jordan\u2019s epic series. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThat was my reading on week 02 of 2021. Let me know how you\u2019re doing in the comments.",

                "text": "If you\u2019ve been following along over the past few reviews, you probably won\u2019t be surprised by another rave review for a Stormlight book.  To be honest, I probably have a somewhat unhealthy obsessions with these books.  There are plenty of books that I enjoy, and stories that I will happily reread and have a new experience with each time, but my experience with this series is on a different level.  Maybe it\u2019s the philosophical questions it confronts, or maybe it\u2019s the incredibly imaginative and vividly detailed world, or maybe it\u2019s the compellingly flawed, fascinating, and terribly relatable characters.  Whatever the case, Oathbringer continues to be, to my mind, the gold standard for what epic fantasy ought to be.",

                "text": "Dark Matter creator Joseph Mallozzi has a new project: adaptating Brian McClellan\u2019s Powder Mage books for television. Deadline reports that Mallozzi is set to write the pilot episode, \u201cwith a view to\u201d showrunning the one-hour series. \n \nMallozzi\u2019s resume leans heavily toward science fiction; he executive produced and wrote for Stargate SG-1, Stargate: Atlantis, and Stargate Universe, created and wrote for the underrated Dark Matter, and is the showrunner for\u00a0Utopia Falls. But Powder Mage takes him in a new direction\u2014the series, which starts with McClellan\u2019s debut novel, Promise of Blood, is set in a fantastical world where powder mages get their abilities from gunpowder. Reviewing the first book, Tor.com\u2019s Stefan Raets said it \u201cseems to be aimed straight at the same readers who enjoy Brandon Sanderson\u2019s novels.\u201d \nHere\u2019s the publisher\u2019s summary of the first book: \nCivil unrest cripples the citizens of Adro in the aftermath of the revolution that obliterated the monarchy. Now, Field Marshal Tamas and his lieutenants must confront the true cost of freedom in book one of the Powder Mage Trilogy. \nIt\u2019s a bloody business overthrowing a king. . . \nField Marshal Tamas\u2019 coup against his king sent corrupt aristocrats to the guillotine and brought bread to the starving. But it also provoked war with the Nine Nations, internal attacks by royalist fanatics, and the greedy to scramble for money and power by Tamas\u2019s supposed allies: the Church, workers unions, and mercenary forces. \nIt\u2019s up to a few. . . \nStretched to his limit, Tamas is relying heavily on his few remaining powder mages, including the embittered Taniel, a brilliant marksman who also happens to be his estranged son, and Adamat, a retired police inspector whose loyalty is being tested by blackmail. \nBut when gods are involved. . . \nNow, as attacks batter them from within and without, the credulous are whispering about omens of death and destruction. Just old peasant legends about the gods waking to walk the earth. No modern educated man believes that sort of thing. But they should. . . \nThere\u2019s no news yet on production schedule, casting, or premiere date.",

                "text": "Hello fellow bookworms  I\u2019ve already talked about what 2021 Reading Challenges I\u2019m joining, but my very own reading challenge returns this year, so here I am posting my #outofcomfortzonechallenge TBR!\u00a0Like last year I picked out 4\u00a0genres and one age range out of my comfort zone to read this year and I have dedicated 3 books per category to put on my TBR! This is less than last year, as I noticed that I didn\u2019t read much of my set TBR as I mood read a lot more compared to previous years, and having too many books picked out beforehand became a source of stress. Therefore, I\u2019m picking my Top 3 Priority Reads per category (still 15 books in total). These are books that I\u2019m super excited for right now, though I might adjust my little TBR when my mood changes  I\u2019m starting with a short reminder of what my challenge is all about and then it\u2019s straight to my TBR!  \nThank you to everyone who already signed up  \n\u27bd There\u2019s still time to sign up all year, if you want to  If I missed your post somehow, feel free to link it down below, I love seeing what is on everyone\u2019s TBR  \n\nBecca @ ipreferthebook\nNikki @ nikkiswiftreads\nSabrina @ wordyandwhimsical\nSophie @ meandink\nTara @ thephantomreads\n\n \nWhat is the Out of Your Comfort Zone Reading Challenge?  \nThe\u00a0aim of this challenge is to\u00a0read books that you consider to be outside of your comfort zone. The Challenge itself is\u00a0tailored to your goals, so it\u2019s going to be really relaxed and individual as everyone has a different definition of their comfort zone. You can set yourself a number of books to read in a particular genre (or subgenre, age range, etc.) or make a TBR with books you hope to get to! There are also fun levels and badges to collect if you\u2019re interested in that! \nGet all the information in my announcement post  \nI\u2019d love for you to join me and chat about our progress throughout the year  \n \n\nSignup Form\nForm for adding your read books\n\n \nMy #outofcomfortzonechallenge TBR  \n \nI read a lot more sci-fi books last year and rediscovered my love for the genre. Right now I\u2019d love to escape into space, so I definitely want to keep reading books in this genre, especially as they have been so much fun!  I have two sequels to beloved books that I definitely want to read in 2021. I adored Skyward, so Starsight is on the top of my priority list and I can see myself reading this very soon  I also need to finally read Undying, as I read the first book such a long time ago, yet never picked up the sequel  Last but not least, I have been wanting to get my hands on Skyhunter, as I love Marie Lu and need to catch up with her new releases! \n\nStarsight (Brandon Sanderson)  Sequel to Skyward\nUndying (Kaufman & Spooner)  Sequel to Unearthed\nSkyhunter (Marie Lu) \n\n \n \nSadly, I still haven\u2019t been reading historical fiction as regularly last year, so I hope to try to read some books again this year! For me, reading historical fiction book with a fantasy element seems to have worked well, so I\u2019m definitely making use of that. As I didn\u2019t get to it in 2020, I will be reading The Dire King, the big finale of the Jackaby series, one of my favorite new series of all time  Apart from that I have been getting more into reading books inspired by the Arthurian legend, so I picked up The Guinevere Deception on ebook as it sounds just like what I\u2019m in the mood for currently! I also want to read The Enigma Game, as I adore the series and I was so excited that we got a new companion book in 2020  \n\nThe Guinevere Deception (Kiersten White) \nThe Enigma Game (Kaufman & Spooner)  Companion to Code Name Verity\nThe Dire King (William Ritter)  Finale of the Jackaby Series\n\n \n \nPredictably, Mystery and Thriller were my least read genres for the challenge last year, as it\u2019s still very much out of my comfort zone. However, I want to try to at least read some books in the genres: thriller, mystery or light horror. My top priority book is Dead Voices, a Middle Grade Horror/Mystery book and sequel to one of my surprise favorites of last year. I love how each book is themed around a different season, for this book it\u2019s winter, so I might read it soon\u00a0  Another author I discovered last year is Kate Alice Marshall (author of Rules for Vanishing) and I\u2019m very excited for her 2021 release Our Last Echoes, it sounds amazing!! A 2020 release I need to get to is I Hope You\u2019re Listening, as it\u2019s a mystery involving a podcast element!  \n\nDead Voices (Katherine Arden)  Sequel to Small Spaces\nOur Last Echoes (Kate Alice Marshall) \nI Hope You\u2019re Listening (Tom Ryan) \n\n \n \nI read a bunch of nonfiction at the beginning of last year, but then it fizzled out towards the end of the year. I\u2019m still happy that I read so many nonfiction books in 2020, as it used to be one genre I never considered for myself. In 2021 I don\u2019t plan on reading as much nonfiction, but I still have some books I\u2019d love to get to. I definitely want to educate myself better on racism, so I\u2019m starting out with So You Want to Talk About Race, which I heard is the most accessible. However, I have more advanced books on my TBR as well. A book that also interests me and that I\u2019ve heard good things about is All Boys Aren\u2019t Blue, a collection of personal essays. Finally, I also plan on reading Body Talk, an anthology with an incredible 37 authors who talk about what living in their bodies is like. \n\nSo You Want to Talk About Race (Ijeoma Oluo) \nAll Boys Aren\u2019t Blue (George M. Johnson) \nBody Talk (Anthology) \n\n \n \nI actually read some adult books last year, though it\u2019s still not an age-range that I reach for often (it\u2019s really intimidating, even with some great recommendations of the bookish community). I 100% want to read Network Effect as I fell in love with the Murderbot Diaries last year and this is the first full-length novel, as the previous books were all novellas. That makes me even more excited as we get more Murderbot content (and there\u2019s another novella out in 2021)  I also fell in love with Matt Haig\u2019s books in the past year and his new 2020 release sounded so good as The Midnight Library deals with multiple realities, which interests me. His books have convinced me in 2020, so I can\u2019t wait to read this one!  Finally, I got the e-book of Get a Life, Chloe Brown, as everyone seems to have loved this romance book! Sadly, I didn\u2019t like the author\u2019s 2020 Christmas novella, but I hope her other books are good! \n\nNetwork Effect (Martha Wells)  Book 5 in the Murderbot Diaries\nGet a Life, Chloe Brown (Talia Hibbert) \nThe Midnight Library (Matt Haig) \n\nAre you planning on participating in the #outofcomfortzonechallenge? What are some books out of your comfort zone you\u2019d like to read?",

Since the pandemic, romance ebooks saw an extra 17% boost in the US:  Romance is a great space to be in for self-publishers, more so with its recent rebound. I quickly go over the trends below. Then, I break down how to get started with writing and eventually publishing your book.  Industry overview The myth about self-published books being priced at $2.99 or below? That\u2019s now broken as reported by the self-publishing platform PublishDrive. In 2020, romance was its 2nd highest-priced category at around $7. The platform also saw crazy spikes in romance subcategories like a 2,728% increase in vampire and a 1,377% increase in new adult. Overall, indies made 69% more digital book sales in 2020 via PublishDrive. The growth was apparent across digital formats like audiobooks, models like subscription services, and channels like libraries. And 70% of the sales came from international markets. Going global, digitally, is the best move for romance indies right now.  <div style=\"text-align: center; CLICK FOR FREE REPORT ON GLOBAL BOOK TRENDS IN 2020 Tips on how to write a romance novelNow you know just how profitable this genre is. Whether you\u2019re an avid romance reader wanting to transition into a writer or an experienced author looking for a refresher, let\u2019s go over the basics for writing romance. First, read as many romance books as you can. Get specific with the subgenre, like vampire, contemporary, or historical romance. It\u2019s important to get a good grasp on how your category is typically structured. Figuring out your subgenre also helps with launching your book later on (I go over this further down.) Don\u2019t know where to start? Check out the works of these romance writers and see how it\u2019s done: Jane Austen is a classic and celebrated romanticist who wrote about love, marriage, societal drama, and more. Start with Emma or Pride and Prejudice (you can watch the film too.)Nora Roberts is a New York Times bestselling author of over 215 novels. Standalone favorites include The Villa, Northern Lights, and The Collector.E L James\u2019 Fifty Shades of Grey started off as a raunchy self-published book, quickly rising to fame as a cultural icon.R.R. Banks is one of PublishDrive\u2019s bestselling contemporary romance authors, making a splash in the realm of audiobooks.Here\u2019s a list of the best romance novels.A good romance novel should keep the reader glued until the end. Here are common tropes to know: The main characters have complementary personalities or reasons to click.The couple goes from friends to lovers or rivals to lovers.The story is plot-driven, with twists, turns, and conflicts. For example, forbidden love.The first meeting is memorable. Romantic comedy? Maybe an embarrassing one.The main characters can\u2019t help but be in each other\u2019s orbit, mainly due to external forces.There are fun interactions and banter.The lovers challenge each other (to be better humans) and share vulnerabilities.The breakup is dramatic and soul-crushing. \u201dThis will never work out!\u201dThe character development arc includes sacrifices to get back together. Love over ego.Eventually, the story rushes to a big declaration of love and commitment.99% of the time, the lovers end up together happily ever after.Keep in mind that people reading romance stories usually do so for cliches and stereotypes. As successful romance writer Jane Eyre said, \u201cthere is no happiness like that of being loved by your fellow-creatures, and feeling that your presence is an addition to their comfort.\u201d More recommendations for your writing process: Watch Brandon Sanderson\u2019s free video courses for general writing advice.

Tips on self-publishing romance novelsAfter completing your manuscript, it\u2019s time to prepare for publication. Here\u2019s what to expect: Editing \u2013 Hire a proofreader or find a beta reader.Cover design \u2013 This is a crucial marketing element for attracting attention. Look at PublishDrive\u2019s bestselling romance book covers for inspiration. \u2193 Layout formatting \u2013 Convert your manuscript file(s) for ebook, audio, or print-on-demand.Distribution \u2013 You can sell only on Amazon KDP (a common choice among indies), but you\u2019ll miss out on billions of other readers. Instead, go wide by distributing everywhere via book aggregators like PublishDrive.Marketing \u2013 Grow your author brand and business with a solid marketing strategy.I suggest reading this guide which expands on every step of the publishing process.  PublishDrive helps prepare your manuscript for ebook, audio, and print conversion. It takes only a few clicks to distribute your book in stores like Amazon, Apple, and Google: \u00a0 Publish In 4 Easy Steps Tip #1: When prepping your book, be sure to optimize metadata. This includes choosing the best (sub)categories, cover design, and adding the strongest hooks in the first two sentences of your blurb. Doing so helps your book rank higher in stores and engage the right audience.  Tip #2: Don\u2019t just publish an ebook; expand your reach with audiobook and print-on-demand. The most successful indies on PublishDrive sell in all three formats to maximize their selling potential. On PublishDrive, you can publish and manage these different formats with a simple upload process. Tip #3: Distribute your book in multiple countries where the demand for English-language content is high. Go beyond Amazon, and distribute in multiple stores as well. Along with major retailers like Google Play Books, online libraries like Odilo are dominating in growth: <div style=\"text-align: center; CLICK FOR FREE REPORT ON GLOBAL BOOK TRENDS IN 2020 Tip #4: Try publishing a series, an effective way to build up author credibility and relevance in search results. Indies use this tactic to add more reads on platforms like KDP. By the way, a series doesn\u2019t mean sequels. You can write three unrelated romance novels and package them together with a series name like \u201cRomance to Read While Traveling.\u201d Tip #5: Invest in your marketing, seriously. PublishDrive analyzed 800 price promos for online retail stores. These promos achieved 10x more sales and an additional 2% bump for non-promoted books. Tactics like discount campaigns, Facebook ads, Amazon ads, Bookbub ads, newsletter features, and social media swaps with published authors make up a powerful strategy. Promotions help attract readers to your book. Then, items like your cover design, title, blurb, and reviews help convert to sales.  Absorb everything you can on writing and creating a romance book. Afterward, treat self-publishing as a business (going global and digital is key!) In an environment like the pandemic, we see why the demand for love stories has gone up. In the words of bestselling romance author Gena Showalter, \u201cI went online and ordered every romance novel I could find. They're fairy tales for grown-ups.\u201d \u2764\ufe0f  When you\u2019re ready, sell and promote in thousands of stores worldwide with PublishDrive.

                "text": "Hello, my Cosmere Chickens, and welcome to the first REAL installment of the Rhythm of War reread! (I don\u2019t really count the read-along posts, because we couldn\u2019t reference anything that happened later in the book.) This installment covers the first set of interludes between parts one and two. \n \nReminder: We\u2019ll be discussing spoilers for the entirety of the series up until now. If you haven\u2019t read ALL of the published entries of the Stormlight Archive (this includes the novellas Edgedancer and Dawnshard, as well as the entirety of RoW), best to wait to join us until you\u2019re done. And yes, we will be mentioning things that happen later in the book, because these Interludes are stuffed full of foreshadowing. \n \n \n \nHeralds \n\nFor Syl\u2019s chapter, all four Heralds depicted are Jezrien, Herald of Kings and patron of the Windrunners. This makes perfect sense, for an Honorspren.\nInterestingly, all four icons for Sja-Anat\u2019s chapter are Palah (Paliah), patron of the Truthwatchers. This is of particular note considering the fact that two Truthwatchers are Bonded with spren that have been corrupted by her! (Renarin, and by the end of this book, Rlain.)\nTaravangian\u2019s chapter Heralds are all of Chach, aka Chanarach (Chana), the patron of Dustbringers. She\u2019s also the Herald associated with bravery/obedience. Now, Mister T has a Dustbringer in his employ, it\u2019s true. But I wonder if the bravery part is the important aspect in this chapter. He truly believes that he\u2019s being brave and self-sacrificing in his actions. Also, there\u2019s a lovely bookending effect with the fire in his hearth, appropriate to Chana\u2019s connection to fire. So, multiple reasons for Chach.\n\nIcon: New icons! I love the one for Syl, and Sja-Anat\u2019s is really cool, too. I particularly like the two-faced symbolism in Sja-Anat\u2019s. We know she\u2019s got some sort of double-agent thing going on, so this is very cool to see and makes a lot of sense. Taravangian\u2019s\u2026 confuses me. Is this supposed to symbolize the Diagram? \nA: Gorgeous new icons! I agree that Taravangian\u2019s is confusing, but it reminds me a lot of the King artwork on some playing cards. At least, that\u2019s where my mind went, and in my chapter notes spreadsheet, I called it \u201csword king.\u201d It may be intended to invoke the Diagram, the sword, and the king all at once\u2014and possibly even a few other things! I\u2019m assuming the artist knew the connections that were going to be made by the end of the book, anyway. \nChapter Recap\nWHO: Sylphrena; Sja-anat; Taravangian \nWHERE: Urithiru; Kholinar; Urithiru \nWHEN: Sylphrena: 1175.3.8.3 / Sja-Anat: 3.10.2 / Into the Fire: 3.10.4 \n(Note: For the \u201cwhen\u201d notations, we are using this wonderful timeline provided by the folks at The 17th Shard.) \n \nSyl reflects on how she wishes she could help Kaladin with his depression. She asks both the Stormfather and Dalinar to Connect her to him more fully so she can better understand, and is rebuffed by both. \nSja-Anat sends off one of her children to visit Mraize and is visited by Odium. The two play a complicated game of mental chess and lies. \nTaravangian sends all of his attendants away, as he\u2019s planning on betraying Dalinar in order to secure safety for his home and his people. \nOverall Reactions\nShe didn\u2019t simply hear secrets; she took them. She made them hers. And she kept them. \nL: We don\u2019t really have a section that works for the Unmade, so this commentary is going here. \nA: I like the way she talks about keeping her secrets from everyone. Whether she\u2019s going to turn out to be \u201cgood\u201d remains to be seen, but her determination to be as independent as possible is confirmed, and is very intriguing. \n\u2026existing between the Physical and Cognitive Realms. Like many of the Unmade, she belonged to neither one fully. Odium trapped them in a halfway existence. Some would manifest in various forms if they resided too long in one place, or if they were pulled through by strong emotions. \nL: Well, this is new information! \nA: It\u2019s going to be helpful info in Part Two, also, as Team Envoy-to-the-Honorspren heads off into Shademar. I love that Sanderson popped this hint in the Interlude, so we\u2019re primed when it becomes relevant to people who have to be in one Realm or the other. \n\u2026it wasn\u2019t that she had a foot in each realm; more, she was like two entities that shared a mind. \nL: Well that\u2019s interesting! And also makes that new icon make even more sense! \nA: I wonder\u2026 there are three Realms. Is that why she has three faces in the icon? That\u2019s a way cool concept. \nL: Somehow I totally missed the third face until just now. ::facepalm:: \nDuring the long millennia before this Return, she\u2019d mostly slumbered. Without her bond to Odium she had trouble thinking. \nL: Ahhh, that makes the long absence of the Unmade make sense. They\u2019re like the spren; unable to function without their Bonded one nearby. So\u2026 are the Unmade some sort of spren that Odium has Bonded to himself, then? \nA: I\u2026 I really wish I understood their origin story. I think there\u2019s a strong chance they were \u201cgreat spren\u201d\u2014maybe just a step below the Nightwatcher and Stormfather\u2014that Odium coopted, but now I can\u2019t help wondering about something I hadn\u2019t really considered before: Could they be one from each family of sapient spren (except Bondsmiths, who have different spren anyway) that Odium Nahel-bonded? It would make a certain amount of sense, though I\u2019ll have to think about it with both hands to make a proper Tin-Foil-Theory out of it. \nL: Well, now that we have one that\u2019s a \u201csort of kind of good guy,\u201d maybe we will get a backstory flashback. \nA: Incidentally (last-minute addition)\u2014Sja-anat slumbered because she had trouble thinking without her Connection to Odium. Is that why Nergaoul was still active? Because there\u2019s not much thinking going on anyway, so it\u2019s no different than normal? \nBut she knew she was not as smart as Odium was. She could keep only a few secrets from him, and she had to choose carefully, clouding them behind other secrets that she gave away. \nA: Fascinating. Absolutely fascinating. I can\u2019t help thinking that this is foreshadowing something that we won\u2019t see fulfilled until the back half. Or maybe book five, at the earliest. We\u2019ve already gotten just a hint of it, of course, in the way her modifications to Glys have made Renarin \u201cinvisible\u201d to Odium and blurs his sense of those in the same physical vicinity. I hope, anyway, that more of her modifications will spike further plans, because no matter who the Vessel is, I do not trust that Shard. \nGod of all adopted spren. \nL: Adopted? Interesting word choice there\u2026 \nA: Indeed. \nShe did not corrupt. She Enlightened them, showing them that a different path was possible. \nL: Hmm. A different path than what, exactly? \nA: Different than adherence to the way marked out by Honor and/or Cultivation\u2014or Ishar? I can imagine how it might apply to the intelligent spren, but I\u2019m baffled what \u201cdifferent path\u201d she could show windspren. \nHer children darted away to do her bidding, then one of her greater children manifested. A glowing and shimmering light, constantly changing. One of her most precious creations. \nI will go, Mother, he said. To the tower, to this man Mraize, as you have promised. Odium will see you, she replied. Odium will try to unmake you. \n \nI know. But Odium must be distracted from you, as we discussed. I must find my own way, my own bond. \n \nL: There\u2019s a lot to unpack here! First of all. Greater child? Looking for a bond?! I\u2019m curious if this is the one that Bonded Rlain. \n\n\t\n\t\n\t\tBuy it Now\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\nA: This is definitely my assumption. It\u2019s pretty clear in this passage that Sja-anat is sending a corrupted enlightened mistspren (like Glys) to Urithiru, but that actually bonding Mraize is optional. I figured that he went, took a look at the Ghostbloods, noped out, and looked around for a better option. Also, there\u2019s a point (chapter 30) where Mraize is ragging on Veil because he\u2019s \u201cstill waiting for the spren she promised would bond me,\u201d and Veil retorts along the lines that Sja-anat only promised to send the spren, not that it would choose him, and if the spren doesn\u2019t want to bond him, it\u2019s his own fault. So I think it\u2019s a pretty solid bet that this is Tumi, the one that eventually bonds Rlain. I could be wrong, but Occam\u2019s Razor is a Thing. \nL: Second! Mraize is still hanging out in Urithiru, is he? It makes sense, as that\u2019s where all of the important stuff is going on. \nA: UGH. I mean, we knew he was there in Oathbringer, when he was pretending to be a Sadeas soldier, and we also knew he had Shallan\u2019s brothers brought there. So\u2026 yeah, I suppose it makes sense that he\u2019s still there. His notion that he can demand a spren bond is pretty arrogant\u2014not to mention ridiculous\u2014but it fits his personality. \nIf he were to know the deepest secret parts of her soul, he would not be surprised. For she had come from him. Unmade by his hand. \nBut as with all children, she had become more. \nA: What more? I find Sja-anat the most intriguing of all the Unmade at this point, because the range of possibilities for her future activities is so broad. I expect this to come to fruition more in the back half of the series, though\u2014probably along about the time we get Renarin\u2019s book. \nOdium\u2019s song\u2014like a rhythm but more resonant. One of the three pure tones of Roshar. \nL: A concept which will, of course, become very important later. \nA: Heh. Indeed. I love the way Sanderson slipped so many little hints into this first set of Interludes that will have Huge Implications And Effects later on. \n\u201cI am eager for the invasion,\u201d she said. \u201cI will very much like to see my cousin again.\u201d \nL: Cousin, eh? \nA: I\u2019m really wondering about this\u2026 I mean, she admits that she says it mostly to annoy Odium and make him suspicious of her desire to go to Urithiru, but I\u2019m betting there\u2019s some level of truth in it. I\u2019ve wondered if, originally, there were ten children of Honor and Cultivation, and the Sibling is the only one who wasn\u2019t Unmade. So many possibilities. \nMusic, Mechanisms, and Manifestations of Light\nSylphrena felt the energy of the approaching highstorm like one might hear the sound of a distant musician walking ever closer. Calling out with friendly music. \nA: We didn\u2019t know it yet the first time we read this Interlude, but what foreshadowing! Music is going to be a strong theme in this book, particularly in combination with the light brought by the two storms. I recall enjoying the imagery the first time through, but I didn\u2019t think too hard about it at the time. On the reread, this is just brilliant, and it\u2019s funny to read how he hammers it in with multiple references to the music in the storm throughout this Interlude. \n\u2026and the tower had been bright with lights\u2026 A strange kind of light\u2026 \nL: This is from Syl\u2019s memories of the Tower from before the Recreance. It\u2019s interesting that she says a strange kind of light, since we can now definitively say that it was Towerlight that was powering it. \nA: More foreshadowing! Again, we had no idea, at this point in the book, that there was anything but Stormlight and Voidlight available as sources of Investiture. Syl drops this hint that there\u2019s another kind, and before we\u2019re done, we\u2019ll learn a whole lot more. \nSpren and Shadesmar\nShe was invisible to almost everyone but those she chose\u2014and today she chose the children. \nL: Absolutely adorable. \nAs always, small thoughts bombarded her as she flew between them, waving, smiling, changing shapes repeatedly from one moment to the next. \nL: Hmm, fascinating, considering how the windspren are what forms the Plate eventually. They\u2019ve got a very distinct link that we can see here through this psychic connection. I\u2019m so curious as to what types of spren form the other orders\u2019 Plate. I bet the Lightweavers\u2019 is creationspren, considering how often Shallan sees them around her. My spheres would be on gloryspren for Bondsmiths. \nA: Yep. Lifespren for the Edgedancers is almost a given, they way they cluster around Lift, and I\u2019m betting on flamespren for Dustbringers. Elsecallers might be logicspren. I\u2019m not ready to guess at any of the rest. \nHow had the first honorspren\u2014or cultivationspren, or inkspren, or peakspren, or any of the other intelligent ones\u2014been created? Had they been shaped from raw Investiture by Honor himself? Had they grown out of these, their cousins? \nL: A really cool question! Was Honor using the original spren as blueprints for his new creations, or did he actually change existing ones? Evolved them somehow, with Investiture? \nA: Did he Make them from the lesser spren, and then Odium Unmade some? That\u2019s my current theory, but it could change at any moment. \nShe felt so much kinship with them, though they were clearly different. Not as smart. Could she help them become smart? \nA: Absolutely fascinating thought, coming as it does just before an interlude with Sja-anat. Is there a connection? \n\u201cYou never make choices. You merely blow as you always do.\u201d \nI AM BUT THE STORM. YOU ARE MORE. \n\u201cYou avoid responsibility,\u201d she said. \u201cYou claim you do only what a storm must, but then act like I\u2019m somehow wrong for doing what I feel I must! \nL: Gotta respect Syl for standing up to the Stormfather! \nA: Yet more foreshadowing. Later in the book we get to see Dalinar arguing the exact same point with the Stormfather. \nTHIS IS OUR WORLD. IT BELONGS TO THE SPREN. \nL: Ooooh, interesting. I wonder what he thinks about the listeners\u2019/singers\u2019 claim to the world. \nA: I do find this an odd sentiment. As I understand it, the spren are a manifestation of the thoughts of those who live on the planet, so until there were people capable of thought, there would have been no spren. Maybe I\u2019m wrong; maybe it doesn\u2019t take sapience to form spren. We don\u2019t really know much about the appearance of lifeforms on the planet, I guess\u2026 \nShe wished she could talk to objects like Shallan did, and hear each one\u2019s story. \nL: For some reason I never considered that \u201chearing\u201d the thoughts of inanimate objects was something that only the Lightweavers and the Elsecallers could do, and the spren could not. \nA: Never crossed my mind. Fascinating. \nBruised, Broken, and Disabled\nSyl\u2019s ADHD\u00a0\nThoughts bombarded her. What did it feel like to be a tuber being cut? How long had it taken Rock and Song to come up with Cord\u2019s name? Should Syl have a name that was a poem? Maybe they had a name for her among the Horneaters. Did they have names for every spren, or just important ones? \nL: Brandon has confirmed that he\u2019s written Syl as presenting ADHD. \nA: Which is\u2026 unexpected, to me. It never occurred to me that spren would have the same kinds of mental issues as humans. They\u2019re sapient, so I guess\u2026 why not? It was interesting that she points out that it\u2019s not an honorspren thing, because \u201cthe others weren\u2019t like her, except maybe Rua.\u201d \nAlso, I love her musings on Cord\u2019s name. \nShe often had trouble in a room full of talking people, whether they were humans or spren. She would be intrigued by every conversation, her attention diverted constantly. \nL: This is something that a lot of my friends with ADHD talk about! \nOne might have thought the storm would be the same way, but it wasn\u2019t loudness that bothered her\u2014it was a diversity of loudnesses. The storm was a single voice. \nA: From a slightly different angle, this is something that my son could tell you all about. He doesn\u2019t mind loud music at all, but the chaotic nature of a room full of unfocused conversations drives him nuts. \nKaladin\u2019s Depression\n[Kaladin] needed [Syl\u2019s] help, and she couldn\u2019t give it. She couldn\u2019t understand. \nL: I\u2019ve been on both sides of this situation, and it\u2019s just so, so hard. \nHowever, there was a reason he\u2019d had difficulties as a surgeon in the past. He would continue to have the dark brain. This wasn\u2019t a solution. She needed a solution. \nL: Oh, Syl. You poor sweet child. \nCHILD. REBELLIOUS CHILD. YOU HAVE COME TO ME WISHING. \n\u201cI want to understand him,\u201d Syl said, revealing the thought she\u2019d been holding\u2014protecting\u2014and sheltering. \u201cWill you make me feel the darkness he does, so I can understand it? I can help him better if I know him better.\u201d \nL: Oh gosh. I just want to give her a hug. I wish I could tell her that understanding won\u2019t necessarily help her to \u201cfix\u201d Kaladin. Even when you understand completely, you may not have the tools needed to give someone who\u2019s drowning that hand to pull them up. They have to want to find their own salvation. Guidance can be offered, of course. But there\u2019s no magical fix for depression. This is an overarching theme in the series, and one that\u2019s been talked about a lot in the fan communities before and after the release of this installment. \nThe thing was, Kaladin wasn\u2019t just some human. She\u2019d picked him deliberately out of millions and millions. \nL: I\u2019d just like to point out that I love the fact that Sanderson is very distinctly calling out the fact that someone with depression is worthy. So often, depression tells us that we\u2019re unworthy, that we\u2019re useless or helpless or unwanted. Syl chose Kaladin out of MILLIONS of people, despite his depression. Or maybe because of it. If you, dear chicken, are one who suffers from this as well, remember that you\u2019re in good company with Kal (and I, for that matter). You are worthy, just as he is, just as I am. And remember that he\u2019d be proud of you and want you to keep fighting. \n\u201cHe\u2019s different, isn\u2019t he?\u201d Syl said. \u201cWorse, because his own mind fights against him.\u201d \n\u201cDifferent, yes,\u201d Dalinar said, leaning on the railing next to her. \u201cBut who is to say what is worse or better? We each have our own Voidbringers to slay, Brightness Sylphrena. No man can judge another man\u2019s heart or trials, for no man can truly know them.\u201d \nL: Much respect to Dalinar, here. \n\u201cYou can help without knowing exactly what he\u2019s feeling. You can be available for him to lean on.\u201d \n\u201cI try. Sometimes he doesn\u2019t seem to want even me.\u201d \n\u201cThat\u2019s likely when he needs you most. \nL: Oof. Yeah. When we pull away is often when we\u2019re hurting the most. It\u2019s so hard to reach out, when you\u2019re in that dark place. You feel like a burden to everyone around you. \nMaybe I can already understand Kaladin, she thought. I had a dark brain of my own, for a while. \nShe had to remember what that had been like. \nL: Storms, I just\u2026 I respect Sanderson\u2019s handling of this so much. Once you\u2019re out, it can be hard to remember just how deep and dark that hole can be. The fact that he has loved ones who suffer from depression has helped him to portray it well, I\u2019m sure. \nA: Lyn, I\u2019d like to pass on a question from last week\u2019s comments. I answered for myself, and I think your comments here answer most of it, but the question was this: \nWhen you\u2019ve struggled with depression and mental illness, and you read Kaladin and Shallan go through their traumas AGAIN in this book, after they\u2019ve gone through multiple book\u2019s worth, what is your reaction? Are you thankful that Sanderson is portraying this so realistically? Are you wishing they would have shown more improvement by now? Do you agree that this should be depicted so unflinchingly, or are you more like \u201cI\u2019ve already endured this in real life, I don\u2019t need to read 4000 pages of a fictional character going through the same thing.\u201d \n(They already saw my response, so I won\u2019t repeat it here. Basically, it was \u201cyes.\u201d) \nL: It can be hard to face, because I love the characters and don\u2019t want to see them suffer the same way that I do (in Kaladin\u2019s case at least). But there\u2019s also some relief and joy in seeing representation of my struggles in a character I love. My struggles with depression can\u2019t be magically erased with the wave of a wand (or with Bonding a spren), so it\u2019s nice to see this reflected in a book and think, \u201chey, I\u2019m not alone. Kal\u2019s struggling too\u2026 and he keeps going. I should too.\u201d \nOaths Spoken, Powers Awakened\nShe rolled off the counter and zipped over to examine Cord\u2019s Shardplate stacked neatly in the corner. \u2026 Maybe Syl should have hated it, as she did Shardblades, but she didn\u2019t. It was kind of a corpse\u2014well, lots of corpses\u2014but not as offensive. The difference, she supposed, was attitude. She could sense contentment, not pain, from the Plate. \nL: Reminder for those who may not have read Dawnshard: Cord got this Shardplate during that book, on the expedition to Aimia. I find it interesting that the spren that make up the Plate aren\u2019t deadeyes\u2026 \nA: Definitely interesting! Ever since we started suspecting that the lesser spren form the Plate, though, we\u2019ve been seeing hints of this attitude. The windspren that dance around Kaladin all the time seem so eager for him to be ready. It\u2019s almost like their ultimate joy in life is to be a shield for someone, and if they\u2019re locked into that form, that\u2019s perfectly fine with them. I do hope Sanderson will explore this more, eventually. \nYOU ARE SO CERTAIN THAT YOUR HUMAN IS THE CHAMPION, the Stormfather said. I DO NOT THINK THE WORLD WILL BEND TO YOUR WISHES. \nL: It\u2019s long been supposed that Kaladin\u2019s going to wind up being the Champion. I think that\u2019s\u2026 too obvious. Sanderson\u2019s too crafty for that! \nA: Heh. I love the way he gives us some of the obvious answers, but only some. The rest are only obvious in hindsight. \nI HAVE THE POWER, BUT NOT THE ABILITY. \nL: Well, that\u2019s an interesting distinction. So it\u2019s like\u2026 he has a bunch of water, but no means to pour it? \nA: This one makes my brain hurt! It makes sense if I close one eye, I understand it, but\u2026 I can\u2019t put it into words any other way. Or maybe that\u2019s just old age. \n\u201cA Bondsmith Connected the Heralds to Braize, made them immortal, and locked our enemies away. A Bondsmith bound other Surges and brought humans to Roshar, fleeing their dying world. A Bondsmith created\u2014or at least discovered\u2014the Nahel bond: the ability of spren and humans to join together into something better. You Connect things, Dalinar. Realms. Ideas. People.\u201d \nL: Lots of information here that we\u2019d either only heard in passing or had to infer from clues dropped along the way. I especially find the part about Connecting the Heralds to Braize interesting. It makes sense; I\u2019d just never really considered before that that must have been what happened so that they kept returning there after each death. \nA: I love every bit of new information, or confirmation\u2026 and each one makes me want more. I also want to know what she means by \u201cother Surges\u201d that were used to bring humans from Ashyn to Roshar; I suspect they may actually be different than the ones we\u2019ve seen, because each world is slightly different. But I\u2019m just guessing. \nCosmere Connections\u00a0\nThe mind did not like being questioned, but the power\u2026 It liked questions. It liked arguments. It was passion. \nThere was a weakness here. In the division between the Vessel and the Shard. \nL: And weaknesses, of course, exist to be exploited! \nA: Yissssss! \nSecret Societies\nBesides, the farther they progressed, the less accurate the Diagram became. \nL: But it doesn\u2019t matter now, because they\u2019ve achieved their end. \nA: Sadly enough. Or at least, short-sightedly enough. Not that it will matter\u2026 I wonder if Rayse!Odium, assuming he won the battle of champions, would actually have killed all the humans just for fun anyway, or if he\u2019d have just left them and the singers there to duke it out while he yeeted off to look for other Shards to shatter. \nHow lucky was he, to have had a friend for\u2026 storms, seventy-three years? \nL: Man, for all his evils\u2026 sometimes I really do feel bad for the guy. \nA: Almost\u2026 Well, I\u2019ll give him this, he takes personal responsibility for his decisions. I can respect that, at least. \n\u201cThe Diagram,\u201d Taravangian said, \u201chas served its purpose. We have protected Kharbranth. We have fulfilled the Diagram. \nL: We\u2019ve written so much about the moral quandary of Mister T\u2019s actions that I don\u2019t want to keep belaboring the point aside to mention that I really appreciate how well-written his character is. \nA: Yeah\u2026 a well-written character that I thoroughly dislike. \n\u201cDismantle our secret hospitals; release our soldiers to the city guard. If there are any middling members you think know too much, give them a time-consuming \u2018secret\u2019 quest far from civilization. Danlan should be among the first of this group. \n\u201cAs for Delgo, Malata, and the others too useful to waste, I think they will accept the truth.\u201d \nA: Point one: At least the secret \u201chospitals\u201d will be gone, finally. So there\u2019s that. Point two: Danlan was never more than a useful tool, who has now outlived her usefulness. I give low odds on her surviving her \u201csecret quest.\u201d Point three: I\u2019m sure he\u2019s right about Malata (his pet Dustbringer from Oathbringer), since she\u2019s never been committed to his cause for its own sake. She\u2019s always been in it for her own advantage. We know nothing about Delgo; I wonder if he\u2019s another Dustbringer? \nTaravangian would be given to the Alethi for execution, and his corpse would be burned without a proper funeral. The Alethi gave no honors to traitors. \nL: He made of himself a martyr, one who would be remembered forever as a traitor, but he ensured the survival of his people. What a fascinating character. \nA: Also, yet more foreshadowing. None of this will actually happen, but it will look like it did. The corpse burned beyond recognition will be another\u2019s but since he\u2019ll have vanished, he\u2019ll get whatever funeral rites they\u2019re willing to give. \nHe\u2019d be dead, so what did he care about a funeral? \nL: Interesting, how much our names after we die mean to us. We want our memories to live on. We want to be remembered, and remembered well. It\u2019s\u2026 such a human trait. \nA: No matter what we think we believe, we all have eternity in our hearts. \n\u201cToo often,\u201d Taravangian said to Maben, \u201cthose who write history focus on the generals and the scholars, to the detriment of the quiet workers who see everything done. The salvation of our people is as much your victory as mine.\u201d He bowed and kissed her hand. \nL: Sanderson, you\u2019re making me tear up over TARAVANGIAN, what? How?! Stop it! (Also of particular note, considering what he becomes\u2026) \nA: I still wonder\u2026 Is Maben really who she appears to be? I think she is, but I\u2019m always suspicious of the quiet ubiquitous ones. \nWhile I promised to do whatever was necessary to save our people, I will not go one step further. Not a single death more than needed. \nL: Here\u2019s more of that murky moral territory, again. \nA: It\u2019s a little ironic, though. He won\u2019t let his friend die for him, but he\u2019s okay with thousands and millions of other people dying. Never mind all the people who died for the death rattles, whether they actually gave one or not. \nDukar bowed. \u201cMy king. My eternal king.\u201d \nA: Bahahahaha! Little does he know how true that\u2019s going to become. No, little stormwarden, your tests will no longer be needed\u2026 \nA real hearth, with real wood, dancing with flamespren. His pyre. \n\u2026 \nHe walked to the hearth and watched the dancing flamespren before dropping his copy of the Diagram into the fire. \nA: I loved the symmetry of these lines\u2014one near the beginning, before his friends arrive to say their goodbyes, and one at the end after they\u2019ve left, when the writings that have driven them all go up in smoke. \nTinFoil TheoryCrafting\nAnytime too much power\u2014too much Investiture, too much self\u2014congregated, realms became porous and time behaved oddly. \nL: It\u2019s that most rare of occasions, when I actually don a tinfoil hat myself. I foretell that eventually in the Cosmere, so much Investiture is going to be gathered in one place that they\u2019re going to go back in time to fix the Shattering. \nA: Wow! As tinfoil theories go, that\u2019s pretty astounding! \nGeography, History, and Cultures\nShe barely remembered the place from before, when she\u2019d bonded her old wonderful knight. He\u2019d spent most of his life traveling to little villages, using her as a Shardblade to cut cisterns or aqueducts for the people. \nL: This is really cool, to finally see some concrete memories of Syl\u2019s old Knight Radiant. \nA: And what a wonderful man he must have been! Not worrying about glory, or what might be due his position, he went around to little villages to do public works projects, because he could do it so much more easily than they could. It\u2019s really neat to see that this is what the old Knights Radiant could be: fighting and protecting when needed, but also watching out for the little needs of ordinary people. A true public servant. \n\u201cHe died. My knight, Relador. He went to fight, despite his age. He shouldn\u2019t have, and when he was killed, it hurt. I felt alone. So alone that I started to drift\u2026\u201d \nL: Poor guy. And such a Windrunner thing to do. Protecting those who couldn\u2019t protect themselves, almost certainly. \nA: I was so happy to see a name for him. And yes, very much a Windrunner at heart. \nHumans\nGuide her well, and do not trust Dova. Having met more of the other Heralds, I\u2019m certain Battah is not as stable as she seems.\u201d \nL: Oh hey, another Herald \u201csighting!\u201d \nA: While I do believe she\u2019s a Herald, I\u2019m still not convinced she\u2019s Battah, and Sanderson hasn\u2019t yet (as far as I can ascertain) confirmed it. There\u2019s a RAFO from a couple of years ago, and that\u2019s it. Hmm. \nBrilliant Buttresses\nShe turned into a tuber anyway and rolled around on the counter to say thanks. \nL: Okay, fan-artists. You\u2019re up. Draw Syl as a potato. We\u2019re counting on you. \nA: LOL! Have I got a deal for you. Courtesy of Elizabeth Johnson in The Stormlight Archive Facebook group, Behold: Syltato! \n \nThe timing of Lyn\u2019s request is hilarious, because just a week ago, someone posted a game: \u201cMake this potato into a Cosmere character, and everyone else will try to guess who it is.\u201d Along with having a lot of fun, we learned that if the Facebook algorithm thinks you are calling or comparing someone to a potato, you get a \u201cviolation of community standards on bullying and harassment\u201d notice. (I guess you can probably only get to that link if you\u2019re part of the group, so there\u2019s that\u2026 Sorry.) \nL: Thanks a lot, Gordon Ramsay. \nHonorspren\u2014all of the intelligent spren\u2014were something new to Roshar. Well, new as in ten-thousand-years-old new. So\u2026 newer. \nA: Unintentional humor on her part, perhaps, but this cracked me up. (Might be worth noting that the intelligent spren seem to have come along just about the same time as the conflict between the humans and the singers\u2026 Within five hundred years or so, anyway.) \n\u00a0 \nWell, that\u2019s us for this week, blazing through all three Interludes. Next week, we begin Part Two: Our Calling. Chapter 20 is long enough that we\u2019ll be dealing with it alone. \nWe\u2019ll be leaving further speculation to you in the comments, so have fun and remember to be respectful of the opinions of others! \nAlice is not going to comment on current events; there\u2019s too much of that going around. Instead, she\u2019ll be up there in the rainy PNW rereading 1984 and Fahrenheit 451. Look for her @Wetlander on your social media sites (still on Facebook, checking out the functionality of several others). Not that she\u2019ll say anything cool or interesting, but she might be there. \nLyndsey wants you all to remain safe over the next couple weeks, and entreats you to remember that Black lives still matter. If you\u2019re an aspiring author, a cosplayer, or just like geeky content, follow her work on Facebook or Instagram. She also messes around on TikTok from time to time.",

These are mostly books which have been on my shelf for awhile now but don't have to be, maybe you got it two weeks ago and really want to read it! Thanks to Jodie from\u00a0Books for Company\u00a0for this meme!Want to Join?-Pick a book you have been meaning to read-Do a post telling us about the book \u00a0 \u00a0-Link the post up in the linky \u00a0-Visit the other blogs  From Goodreads:The Stormlight Archive saga continues in Rhythm of War, the eagerly awaited sequel to Brandon Sanderson's #1 New York Times bestselling Oathbringer, from an epic fantasy writer at the top of his game. After forming a coalition of human resistance against the enemy invasion, Dalinar Kholin and his Knights Radiant have spent a year fighting a protracted, brutal war. Neither side has gained an advantage, and the threat of a betrayal by Dalinar\u2019s crafty ally Taravangian looms over every strategic move. Now, as new technological discoveries by Navani Kholin\u2019s scholars begin to change the face of the war, the enemy prepares a bold and dangerous operation. The arms race that follows will challenge the very core of the Radiant ideals, and potentially reveal the secrets of the ancient tower that was once the heart of their strength. At the same time that Kaladin Stormblessed must come to grips with his changing role within the Knights Radiant, his Windrunners face their own problem: As more and more deadly enemy Fused awaken to wage war, no more honorspren are willing to bond with humans to increase the number of Radiants. Adolin and Shallan must lead the coalition\u2019s envoy to the honorspren stronghold of Lasting Integrity and either convince the spren to join the cause against the evil god Odium, or personally face the storm of failure. Why the time hasn't come yet...This book just came out, and I'm just so excited to read it! And I'm planning on reading it soon, yeah! What about you guys? Happy reading!",

                "text": "Author: Brandon SandersonSeries: Mistborn #3Genre: FantasyNo. of pages: 748Dates read: 17.12.20 \u2013 29.12.20Star Rating: 5\n\n\n\nPlot: Having escaped death at the climax of\u00a0The Well of Ascension\u00a0only by becoming a Mistborn himself, Emperor Elend Venture hopes to find clues left behind by the Lord Ruler that will allow him to save the world. Vin is consumed with guilt at having been tricked into releasing the mystic force known as Ruin from the Well. Ruin wants to end the world, and stopping it seems impossible. \n\n\n\nI don\u2019t think I have ever been so affected emotionally by a book in my life! \n\n\n\nIn 2019, after reading so many raving reviews about this trilogy, I decided to pick the first book The Final Empire. I was sat in my garden in the middle of August just absorbing as much of this world as I possibly can. I loved it so much. It was like nothing I had ever read before. Earlier in 2020, I read the second book The Well of Ascension and I remember sitting on my boyfriend\u2019s bed and reading half the book in one sitting. So, at the end of 2020, as the end of the year drew closer I was sitting anxiously. Praying that this ending would be perfect. \n\n\n\nWell, the ending hit me like a ton of bloody bricks!!!!! \n\n\n\nIt\u2019s really hard to put into words how I felt about this book. I find it easy to rate books that are 4 stars and lower but the minute I get to the 5 star range all my thoughts just disappear and all I can think of saying is. It\u2019s just really really good! But I will try. \n\n\n\nSo, first off plot. Sanderson is a master! One of my favourite things in any kind of media is when you find out that an author has being hinting to or foreshadowing something major in the series from the first book. i.e. Tom Riddle\u2019s diary from Chamber of Secrets being a horcrux in the later books. I love it so much and this is what you get in this book! My mind was going 7000 mph trying to connect all the dots from all three books. I was theorising after nearly every single page trying to figure out how this book was going to end. This plot captured me and wouldn\u2019t let me go until I was crying in my room at 2am, I was that fixated on this story. \n\n\n\nI would say personally,  that the Vin and Elend chapters, while super interesting, weren\u2019t my favourites. The more military/strategy focused plots don\u2019t intrigue me as much. But Spook\u2019s espionage plot and TenSoon\u2019s Kandra plot were so good. You learn more about the magic system, the way the world works and overall just more about some great characters. Spook, especially, has been in this series for such a long time so to watch him have a great focus in the trilogy was so good! \n\n\n\nOne of the major things with this plot though was the ending. Did I enjoy it? Well, it broke my heart. Sanderson grabbed my heart and stamped on it. The ending was epic, intense and just when you think you\u2019ve read everything and know everything Sanderson swoops in and drops one more thing on your head. I don\u2019t think anyone going into this book is prepared for that ending. I certainly wasn\u2019t, mentally or emotionally. It is a very realistic ending that I think most fantasy readers tend to stray away from. \n\n\n\nMoving onto the characters. To me, the real MVP was Spook in this book. Watching him grow up from a young boy to a young man was amazing. Tin is also one of my favourite metals and getting to explore the extremities of Tin was super interesting. I really enjoyed his character, watching him go through this world a little taller and a little stronger. I was not expecting to enjoy him as much as I did this book. \n\n\n\nI enjoyed Elend this time round but he was overshadowed by my love for Vin. I enjoy them as a couple more than I thought I would. I did wish they had spent more time together in this book as I feel there was a lot of missed opportunities that Sanderson could have included with the two. Elend was brave and smart as usual but like with Spook, I just enjoyed reading about Vin and reflecting on where she was at the beginning of Book 1 and where she is now in Book 3! She is such a compelling character and while I do wish Sanderson had included more female characters Vin is a powerhouse unto herself. Sanderson really stayed true to the essence of Vin throughout this entire series despite her gaining more confidence and power! \n\n\n\nThe worldbuilding ties so neatly with the points I was making about plot. The whole world that Sanderson had created in this trilogy was so intricate, so detailed, with too many layers to count even if you tried. I enjoyed learning more, especially about how the Kandra work. Even on the last book, Sanderson allows you to understand more about how his world works. And in regards to the plot, my brain was spinning. The reasons why the world is the way it is gets answered and you just are not prepared when going in to read it! \n\n\n\nI don\u2019t think this review has done this book justice for how much I loved it but it\u2019s certainly a glimpse! \n\n\n\nThe next book I will be reviewing is The Art of Dying by Ambrose Parry. A nice historical murder mystery to start the year off!",

                "text": "Today I\u2019ll be talking about my 2020 goals/challenges & how I went. To be honest I lost focus on these challenges completely after I fell into a reading slump in March/April. After that I was simply focusing on reading what I felt like reading to try and kill the slump! So, let\u2019s jump in. \n\n\n\n20 Books to Read in 2020\n\n\n\nThis was a fail\u2026. I read 4 out of the 20 books that I planned to.  Read:  Nyxia Unleashed by Scott Reingten King of Scars by Leigh Bardugo A Map of Days by Ransom Riggs The Hand on the Wall by Maureen Johnson  Didn\u2019t Read:  A Conjuring of Light by V.E. Schwab The Dragon Republic by R.F. Kaung Thunderhead by Neal Shusterman Two Dark Reigns by Kendare Blake The Girl King by Mini Yu Mirage by Somaiya Daud Ruin of Stars by Linsey Miller The Devil\u2019s Thief by Lisa Maxwell The Bedlam Stacks by Natasha Pulley Imaginary Friend by Stephen Chobsky Cilka\u2019s Journey by Heather Morris Wolf by Wolf by Ryan Graudin Courting Darkness by Robin LaFevers Descendant of the Crane by Joan He Black Wings Beating by Alex London This Vicious Cure by Emily Suvada \n\n\n\nBig Book Reading Challenge\n\n\n\nThis one was a bit of a fail. My goal was to read 1 book from each of the following categories:  801 \u2013 900 901 \u2013 1000 1001+ I ended up reading 1 book between 801 \u2013 900 and that was Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix which I reread twice in 2020. Which didn\u2019t really fulfil the challenge as it was a reread & an audiobook. But oh well. \n\n\n\nAlways Fully Booked Challenges\n\n\n\nNext was the challenges in the Always Fully Booked Planner Challenges. \n\n\n\nFirstly, the A to Z Challenge.
