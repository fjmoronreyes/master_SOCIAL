                "text": "Press play to listen to this article \n \nThe pandemic has reached a delicate stage: With an end in sight, the number of new coronavirus infections in Europe is rising once again. \nCountries are now racing against time, trying to distribute vaccines post-haste while tamping down on a flare-up in cases, driven by holiday mixing and a new virus variant, that is threatening to overwhelm hospitals again.   \nIreland \u2014 once a poster child for pandemic management \u2014 is a case in point. A near-vertical spike in infections has sent Dublin scrambling, with public health officials pointing to a relaxation of restrictions ahead of the holiday season as the culprit. And while cases are tapering off slightly, hospitalizations are still on the up.  \nFrance is in a similar bind. The rapid spread of the virus, with around 18,000 new cases a day in the past week, has prompted the French government to impose a nationwide 6 p.m. curfew and tighten the country\u2019s borders. The appearance of new variants first detected in the U.K. is one of the biggest causes for concern; at least 200 to 300 such cases are reported in France every day, according to Health Minister Olivier V\u00e9ran.    \nThen there\u2019s Spain, which was finally able to get its caseload under control after experiencing some of the worst numbers in Europe during the autumn. It, too, is facing a third wave.  \nOn January 15, the country had an infection rate of 575 cases per 100,000 people \u2014 a 60 percent increase from the previous week. \nFernando Rodr\u00edguez Artalejo, professor of preventive medicine and public health at the Universidad Aut\u00f3noma de Madrid, called January an especially \u201ccomplicated\u201d time for Spain. He noted the good news that the highest priority targets for vaccines \u2014 medical personnel and people living in care homes \u2014 are close to being vaccinated. But many of these people, Rodr\u00edguez Artalejo explained, are the low-hanging fruit; outside centralized locations like hospitals and care homes, vaccinating the wider population will be more complex.  \nSomething of a puzzle also remains with rising cases, he added. Socializing over the holidays has created the opportunity for more contact, but whether \u201cthis completely explains the rise is hard to know.\u201d He thinks pandemic fatigue, with weary citizens bending the rules, may also be playing a part.  \nA third factor \u2014 the variant strain of the coronavirus rampaging throughout the U.K. \u2014 can be ruled out for now, said Rodr\u00edguez Artalejo. So far, research efforts have only revealed a small percentage of cases in Spain resulting from this strain.   \nA growing threat\nAlarm over a new variant potentially causing a surge in cases before substantial vaccinations can take place is setting in across Europe, with the scenario driving the decision in many capitals to keep lockdown measures in place \u2014 or tighten them still further. \nVirologist Jeremy Rossman of the University of Kent said he believes there\u2019s \u201ca real risk\u201d of the variant spreading both \u201cthroughout Europe and throughout the world.\u201d  \nHe cautions policymakers to not underestimate the threat, as the mutated virus is already present, likely even \u201csaturated\u201d, in many places.  \nThis means that European countries with low numbers of the variant could see things change for the worse very quickly.  \n\u201cThat first tail [of the curve] is very, very slow,\u201d Rossman said. \u201cWe found the variant in the U.K. two months before it really started to make a difference.\u201d  \nIt now accounts for a majority of new cases in the U.K., and evidence suggests that it\u2019s significantly more infectious.  \nIf the variant produces a sudden surge elsewhere in Europe, it would \u201cmake everything we\u2019ve been doing more difficult.\u201d This is especially true if countries don\u2019t take very strong measures to stop the spread of infections. \u201cUnfortunately,\u201d said Rossman, \u201cmany are not.\u201d \nThe vaccine challenge\nAlthough it\u2019s not yet certain, experts think that vaccines do work against the more infectious variant of the virus. But even then, it\u2019ll take some time before the jab can make a difference. \n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of optimism out there, especially expressed by politicians, for how the vaccines can enable us to to go back to normal,\u201d said Sebastian Funk, professor of infectious disease dynamics at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine. \u201cBut a cautious approach is really warranted.\u201d \nThe academic pointed to the large number of people still needing to be vaccinated. The U.K., for example, is vaccinating over-80s \u2014 a group that actually contributes \u201cvery little\u201d to the burden on hospitals despite being extremely vulnerable. \n\u201cAt least until the summer, vaccines are not going to make an awful lot of difference,\u201d said Funk, pointing to \u201chuge\u201d challenges ranging from logistical problems \u2014 such as getting enough supply up and running \u2014 to dealing with vaccine skepticism.  \nFlavio Toxvaerd, an academic at the University of Cambridge, explains that it becomes all the more important for people to avoid contracting coronavirus as vaccination picks up.   \nHe compared the pandemic response to a race: A stumble at the start of a marathon is unfortunate, but falling two meters before the finish line is even worse.  \n\u201cEveryone who dies now, you could have saved, but you didn\u2019t manage to protect,\u201d Toxvaerd said. \nHe added that health authorities should do everything they can to make sure that people stay healthy to get the most benefit possible from a jab: \u201cRather than take the vaccine\u2019s arrival as a license to let down your guard, you should actually redouble your efforts.\u201d \nThere are signs that authorities are listening \u2014 in the U.K., at least. The country\u2019s capital is under strict lockdown, while its police signalling that they are taking any rule breaking seriously.  \nA more hard-nosed approach to enforcement is long overdue, said Toxvaerd, who praises what he sees as \u201ca new seriousness about policy.\u201d \nNot everyone agrees. Rosanna Tarricone, a professor and health policy expert at Bocconi University in Milan, cites growing inequalities caused by lockdowns \u2014 most acutely felt in the area of schooling, where children without adequate resources are at risk of falling behind.  \nBut if countries fail to contain the spread, they could find themselves in the strange situation that the U.K. is in. As the vaccination roll-out goes into full swing, the country battling an increase in infections that threatens to overwhelm the country\u2019s health service.  \nLast week, it recorded the most COVID-related deaths in one day since the start of the pandemic.    \nThis article has been updated with more recent data. \nThis article is part of POLITICO\u2019s premium policy service: Pro Health Care.

                "title": "A great month for Western democracy, January 2021.",
                "text": "January the first month of the new year, and we already have plenty of developments in the Western democratic front. First of all, in the \"poster-child\" and self declared beacon of the free world, we witnessed something which can be classified as embarassing, laughable and worrying at the same time.      On the 6th of January, a mob of supporters of U.S. President Donald Trump in an attempt to overturn his defeat in the 2020 presidential election, stormed the U.S. Capitol, aiming to prevent the formalization of President-elect Joe Biden's election victory.These rioters occupied, vandalized, and looted parts of the building for several hours, resulting in five deaths.       The storming of the Capitol was described by many as treason, insurrection, domestic terrorism, and an effort by Trump to carry out a coup d'\u00e9tat. The incident was a result of a number of actions by President Trump and his supporters, to keep him in power for at least another term. Trump announced plans for a rally before the January 6 vote count to continue his challenge to the validity of several states' election results. On December 18, he wrote on Twitter; \"Big protest in D.C. on January 6th. Be there, will be wild!\" And sure it was.       President Trump was ardent that he was robbed of victory without any credible evidence to support that belief. Despite assurances from his own departments of Justice and Homeland Security that no serious fraud occurred, Trump has raged against the election result and mounted a relentless campaign to reverse Biden's victory.      From vote recounts to Twitter rants, presuring a top election official in a phonecall, to \u201cfind\u201d enough votes to overturn his defeat, plus numerous lawsuits that followed, one could only wonder why he would not just let go. Even if we for one moment accept that all his claims were true, he could not actually prove anything. Every effort failed to justify his cause. The decent thing would be to admit defeat, step down and fight another day if he felt that he still had the American public's support. His actions, not only hinder any chance of him returning to American politics, but polarized and divided American society, damaged his party plus the image and reputation of his country abroad, as a democratic state.       As Europe was watching with disbelief, America was mocked by countries that itself had heavily criticised for the lack of democratic values, such as Belarus. Its President Alexander Lukashenko, in a meeting with International Ice Hockey Federation president Rene Fasel, for talks amid calls to move the world championship following mass protests against him, compared his country with the United States. \u201cIn our country, protesters and other dissatisfied people don\u2019t storm government agencies and capitols,\u201d Lukashenko said. \u201cWe have a completely normal situation from the perspective of the development of democratic processes.\u201d      As we have only a few days left until the inauguration of Biden, one can only hope that this saga will come to an end, although it is doubtful that we heard the last of Trump. For him to be so desperate to cling onto power, he either had plans for America that did not want to be interrupted, feared as he had something to hide, or there are many powerful circles that desire a different America and backed him. No matter what, he managed to gain many devoted supporters and that ensures or indicates an inevitable change of course for U.S. politics. Even if the Democrats try to mend the damage done by Trump, they too will have to compromise, appeasing or winning back some of his voters, in order to stay in power. So Europe must be prepared for such development, in case.        Besides, our continent had its own fair share of political drama and instability. In just one week, three EU members had their governments imploding and resigning. Italy, the Netherland and Estonia are without a government effectively. All leaderships collapsed due to corruption, infighting, mismanaging and how they dealth the corona virus pandemic. The problem is, that in all three countries, far-right and euroskeptic parties are lurking, gaining influence, ready to pounce and grasp power. And if they do, Europe will have even a more difficult time to stay united, if it doesn't lose another member.    Italy's former premier Matteo Renzi said on Wednesday he was pulling his party's ministers from the cabinet, effectively leaving the ruling coalition without a majority in parliament. Renzi, who heads the tiny Italia Viva party, had long threatened to quit the government, complaining about Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte's plans over how to spend billions of euros promised by the European Union to relaunch the economy.    The country has been viewed as the \"Sick Man of Europe\" for years, with stagnant economic growth, rising poverty,emigration, political instability and euroskepticism. Since the last eurozone economic crisis, Italy has been engulfed in a bitter infighting over reforms,numerous goverment collapses, elections, coalitions, technocratic administrations, clashes with its EU partners over the block's budget. They just don't seem to get a grip and keep it together, or face the reality.    Italy, as all other former European powers, have not got over their former grandeur, influence and wealth. They fail to admit that they now need each other, as the world has dramatically changed since the time of European dominance. Many want things to remain as they are and they avoid reforms at all cost. Others wish for things to go back to what they were-like Britain, and left the EU altogether. Italy refuses to accept that its economy has been so integrated with that of other countries, that it cannot continue the way it has for decades. Reforms are painful but necessary.     They distanced themselves from Greece ten years ago, leaving it at the mercy of Germany and its allies, in an effort to avoid the same fate. \"Italy is too big to fail\", many economists were claiming back then, thus the Italian economy and politics were allowed to continue their antics for another decade. Now since the Covid-19 pandemic is threatening Europe with another financial crisis, in Italy the knives are out again, in order to safeguard vested interests in the country, to the detriment of the ordinary Italian and European citizens.    The country's rulers must understand and make a decision that they cannot have their cake and eat it. They willingly joined the eurozone and they are one of the founding states of the EU. To avoid reforms is daft at this stage. If Greece was forced to privatize, sell out and reform, so can Italy. Having said that, it remains to be seen if the Greek painful path will bear fruits, or it merely turned it into a German de-facto colony, something that both France and Italy refuse to accept for themselves. But then why didn't they stand by Greece, forming a block that could stop and counter-balance the German hegemony in Europe? They do not want to see their national companies and assets, being taken over by foreign-notably German buyers, yet they were happy to see the Greeks ones suffer this fate. What goes around comes around as they say.     In a twisted turn of events, Italy's recent nemesis-the Netherlands, also saw its own government collapsed, over a child benefits scandal. Thousands of parents were wrongly accused by Dutch authorities of fraudulently claiming child allowance, with many of them forced to pay back large amounts of money and ending up in financial ruin. The fact that some parents were targeted for investigation by tax officials because they had dual nationality also underscored long-standing criticisms of systemic racism in the Netherlands.     Well, we ought to remember how Jeroen Dijsselbloem, the Dutch former Minister of Finance and Eurogroup President, treated Greece, by demanding the country to open its financial books and records for inspection. Perhaps the Dutch should have primarily sticked inspecting their own books all these years, to avoid this embarrassment. If they equally focused on what was happening in their own country and national authorities, perhaps they could have coped on earlier and avoided this fiasco. But no, to them it is always the Southern EU states that need to get their taxation system in check, they dance and listen to music and drink wine while the hard working Dutch have to always pay for the tax evading Southerners. Clearly we can see that themselves are not so perfect and spotless after all.     This is a poor way to distract your public from your own faults dear Dutch government, by pointing out the faults of others. Again, what goes around comes around. When the Greeks were crying for mercy, their European \"partners\" threw them to the arms of the IMF to save their own economies.They accused them of not paying taxes, bothered by Greek farmers not declaring all their incomes, while they did not mind rich Greek companies tax evading by relocating their headquarters in countries like the Netherlands. They also accused them of retiring too early, but of course they forgot how generous is their own social welfare systems, offering benefits for life. Belgium's chomage technique, which not only is much higher than Greece's, but in principle unlimited, was never a cause of concern for the Germans and Dutch. Nor, the institutionalization of a part of Ireland's population, by keeping them permanently as welfare receipients, never mind the Scandinavian generocity in benefits.      And the Dutch scandal gets even more sinister, if we think that it is just a revelation of the reality in the country's government mentality, not a mistake or mishap. Because then, it indicates the fascist, racist nature of their policies and explains their contemptuous attitude towards Greece, Italy and Spain. They treat their migrant communities like second class citizens, when they present themselves as a very liberal nation, open and progressive society, ready to condemn others for their human rights abuses. If Greece pushes back a boat loaded with immigrants in the Aegean, they will be the first to criticise, as well and scorn Poland and Hungary for refusing to take them in. At least the Hungarians, although I strongly disagree and despise their attitude on this issue, are honest about it. Hypocrisy however is revolting.    The Netherlands to be fair, is not the only country that struggles with immigration. The whole of Europe does. But then we should stop pretending or keeping up the appearances and do something about it. Work collectively,by establishing a pan-European immigration policy which aims to attract the right immigrants, regarding their numbers, skills, educational background, countries of origin and length of stay. In this way, we can avoid the embarassing double standards, when we allow migrant families to settle in an EU member, offer them citizenship, only to treat them in this horrid manner, in an effort to stigmatize them and make them leave, or discourage others from coming. Yet, our national governments insist on keeping all policies and decisions ultimately to themselves, creating a messy, patchy mosaic or laws and regulations, detached from another state's.    The third country to become without government last week, was Estonia. Like many of the former USSR states and Central/Eastern European nations that joined the EU in 2004, Estonia enjoyed for over a decade an impressive economic boom. Yet, similarly to many others of this region, it can not easily escape its past, proving that democracy and capitalism in these countries are still fragile and vulnerable. In addition, it also indicates that for the EU periphery, like in the case of Greece and Ireland, economic prosperity or political stability are not guaranteed and secured for the long term. Thus, we need to collectively work on maintaining and promoting them, though this can only happen with a more active role of the EU institutions, something that all local, national elites dislike; they obviously want to hold on to power and influence over our national resources for themselves.     Estonia\u2019s Prime Minister J\u00fcri Ratas has ultimatelly resigned, after police and prosecutors launched an investigation into an alleged corruption scandal involving his left-leaning Centre party related to a impropriety, over the \u20ac39 million Porto Franco property development. Ratas just so happens to be in a power-sharing agreement, with the conservative Fatherland party and the Eurosceptic right-wing Conservative People\u2019s Party of Estonia. And like most parties with populist ambition, they are opportunistic and seek to get in power by revealing or underlining government scandals. Thus, Ratas had no option but to resign, hoping the storm passes and regroup for the next election, in order to stop another Euroskeptic party edging closer to power.     To conclude and sum-up all of the above: We in the West must understand that democarcy can never be taken for granted. Even in the richest and strongest countries, things can easily be overturned. Therefore, we must always remain alert. Economies and political systems are constantly being in flux, thus any period of prosperity must be accompanied with preparations, investments and reforms, in order to deal with the eventual and inevitable downturn. Corruption and systemic faults exist in all countries, it is just some of them manage to deal with or cover them with their wealth, government cover-ups and media PR. The poorer a nation is, the more citizen corruption it experiences, due to the fact that its people do what it comes natural in such circumstances; struggle to survive.    For the European rich nations then to go an blatanly slander and scapegoat them, while themselves are enjoying different standards as they exploit their resources, is the worse kind of corruption itself. Inequality among members of a \"union\", renders it as non democratic, thus unworthy. In addition, we need to have an open debate on immigration and reform the relevant laws. It is clear that the approach that we adopted until now does not work. Out of complex of our colonial past, we allowed too many migrants in Europe, but then when we do not want them, we do something even worse to these communities: we treat them as second class citizens, we scapegoat and label them as lazy and corrupt scroungers, seeking to abuse Europe's generous welfare system. But by these actions, we risk allowing the Far-Right to gain more power, destabilizing our continent and societies, threatening what we have worked and built so far in Europe.    Us Europeans are all in this together, meaning that our societies and economies are largely integrated. So any kind of infighting only makes matters worse and ultimately, it must come to a decision. We either start cooperating as a group of nations, preferably by upholding the vision we all have already agreed to adopt, or we revise and reverse back to what we had before, with all the good and bad of a divided continent, always at each other's throats, with peace and prosperity only enjoyed periodically by most.",

                "text": "Some fascinating figures here, handy for rebutting the 'But only old people want the Traditional Mass' canard of the liturgical revolutionaries. From Homiletics and Pastoral Review By Dr Joseph Shaw  Young People, Families, Sex Ratios, and Diversity The Foederatio Internationalis Una Voce (FIUV, or Una Voce International) recently submitted to the Holy See a report on the availability of the Extraordinary Form of the Roman Rite around the world (hereafter, \u201cthe FIUV Report\u201d), in the preparation of which I, as Secretary of the FIUV, was closely involved.1\u00a0This included data from 362 dioceses and 52 countries,2\u00a0and gives a rare overview of the situation, not just in Europe and America, but across the world. Much of the information was of a qualitative rather than quantitative nature (for example, detailing the policies of dioceses towards the EF), aspects of it are amenable to statistical summary and presentation. The full report is not public, but in this paper I wish to set out some data drawn from it to help illuminate the question of the demographics of those who attend the EF.3 These data support the often-heard characterization of the EF as having a particular attraction for young people and families. I shall further draw on the Report and other sources to show that EF congregations generally have a more balanced sex ratio than those of the Ordinary Form, and to reveal the capacity of the EF to engage diverse ethnic and linguistic groups. MethodologyThe FIUV was prompted to produce its Report by the news, first reported in April 2020, that the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith had distributed a short questionnaire to bishops around the world on the subject of the Extraordinary Form. The Federation considered that a lay perspective on the situation might be a useful supplement to the bishops\u2019 responses, and set about creating a questionnaire of its own, to be completed, like the bishops\u2019, diocese by diocese. This was circulated, in multiple languages, as an online form, and respondents were invited through the Federation\u2019s member associations and other contacts. In nearly all cases, returns for a diocese were completed by one or more lay persons on the ground in the diocese: people personally familiar with celebrations and congregations, their history, aspirations, and frustrations. One of the questions was as follows: About the stable groups attached to the Extraordinary Form: Are they comprised of elderly people, families, young people, etc.? It should be noted that neither time nor resources allowed for a census of congregations. Respondents were invited to make a judgment about what seemed striking about the congregations they know, bearing in mind the local population (which might be a University city or a popular retirement location); in the background also would be their knowledge of local Ordinary Form congregations. They were asked to tick one of the following, although the software allowed them to tick as many as they liked: Predominantly older people. Predominantly younger people. Predominantly families. Matches local population. Not applicable. Respondents also had the chance to \u201cComment further if you wish.\u201d The data discussed here are drawn not only from the ticked boxes, but also from the comments. In a few cases these explained that different regular EF congregations in different parts of the same diocese had different demographic features. In order to maintain the principle that each diocese would count for one, for statistical purposes, when this happened I have assigned a value of 0.5 to each of two different congregations. In the statistical analysis I created two extra categories, in addition to those just noted, to cover cases where respondents ticked more than one box in relation to a single congregation or group of congregations: \u201cYounger people and Families\u201d and \u201cYoung people and Old people.\u201d Response rateIn a number of countries the Federation received information for every single diocese: countries which have only one (Sweden, Estonia, Denmark and Luxembourg) or two (Malta), and larger countries with very active member associations: Germany (27 dioceses), England and Wales (22), Scotland (8), the Netherlands (7), and New Zealand (6). More typical, however, were those countries where reports were received for only a minority of dioceses, or just one or two dioceses. In most countries surveyed, the dioceses not covered are overwhelmingly those in which, as far as the FIUV\u2019s local contacts are aware, there are no public celebrations of the EF, or active groups of the laity requesting it. Similarly, most of the countries not included, such as many in Africa and the Islamic world, would be returning \u201cnull returns\u201d if they were included. While there are exceptions to this generalization, we may be confident that the FIUV survey captures the great majority of stable groups seeking or experiencing the Extraordinary Form around the world today, and there is no reason to think that these are not characteristic of those which are not included. As it is, the survey extends beyond the places where the EF is regularly celebrated, to include many dioceses where a lay group is asking for it, so far without success. It is this which explains nearly all of the instances in which \u201cNo Information\u201d is recorded. The respondent was either unsure what the demographic profile of those Catholics attached to the EF might be, having never seen them together at a service, or considered that a response would not be very meaningful. The demographic profile of the signatories of a letter to an Ordinary making a formal request for a regular celebration of the EF, for example, might be quite different from the profile of the people who would turn up for the celebration. Who attends the Extraordinary Form?The following table gives the number of dioceses, and the percentage of dioceses, in which the EF congregations are characterized by particular demographic groups, by continent or region.4 (I could not format it, so here it is as a Google Doc.-JW) Table: Dominant demographic in EF Congregations\u00a05 With some variations between continents and regions, the results make clear the very strong association between celebrations of the Extraordinary Form and young people and families. The percentage of dioceses where EF congregations are identified as predominantly old is in no region greater than 11.1%; the percentage where young people, young people and families, or families, is identified as predominant is 72% in North America, 69.2% in Central Europe, 62.3% in South America, 60.4% in Asia, 57.5% in Oceania, 55.5% in North East Europe, 51.7% in North West Europe, 31.7% in Southern Europe, and 28.6% in Africa. In the last of these no information is given for 42.9% of dioceses, and it is certainly no coincidence that Africa and Southern Europe are the areas with the least well-established EF celebrations in the survey. North America, on the other hand, is the region where the greatest number of large and well-established EF congregations are to be found. In many of the regions covered, above all those of Europe, civil society is suffering a demographic crisis, and the Church has experienced this crisis in an amplified form. Thus, while in England and Wales the post-war \u201cbaby boom\u201d has been followed by a decline in the birth rate, the fall in the number of baptisms has been even more severe: according to baptism figures published annually by the\u00a0Catholic Directory,\u00a0compared to annual live births collated by the Office for National Statistics, nearly 16% of babies were baptized in the Catholic Church in 1965, but only 10% of a much-reduced total in 2011.6\u00a0The Church in other European countries has fared worse. Against this background these data for the EF are particularly striking, and positive. Where do they come from?The question arises, where are these young people and families coming from, and how do they relate to each other? It is clear, at least, that the number of families attending the EF around twenty years ago is insufficient to explain the young people present today, in the context of the very small number of EF celebrations in and around the year 2000. The majority of the people, including young people, who attend the EF today have encountered it for the first time as adults. Discovering the EF in the Church today is very much a matter of chance: even in those dioceses where it is most widely available, very little effort is made in sacramental preparation, in officially approved books about the Faith, or in preaching to make the average Catholic aware of its existence. Practicing Catholics are for this reason only slightly more likely to encounter this Form of the Mass than non-Catholics, although they are somewhat more likely to have heard polemics aimed against it. It is therefore unsurprising to find that EF congregations include many converts and \u201creverts\u201d (formerly lapsed Catholics). Another factor in the ability of the EF to draw in younger worshippers is the wide use made of social media in explaining and promoting it, which disproportionately reaches young people. A search of YouTube, for example, quickly throws up numerous well-produced testimonials by young Catholics, often converts, who have discovered the EF. This is an example of a virtuous circle at work, since these videos, like many websites and blogs with similar content, are generally created spontaneously by young people who have discovered the EF and are familiar with social media techniques. It can\u2019t explain why they liked the EF when they encountered it. Similarly, the popularity of the EF with children creates its own atmosphere and set of expectations. In central Rome, where churches are tragically short of children for a variety of reasons, one mother of young children explained to me that an EF celebration she had discovered was the only place she could take her children without their behavior attracting negative comments from an aging congregation: in part, this is an example of another virtuous circle benefiting the EF. \u201cYoung and Old\u201dThis image of the EF, as a form of liturgy particularly attractive to young adults and parents of young children, has only with difficulty established itself in competition with an older characterization of the EF, namely as something which appeals predominantly to the older generation. In the decades immediately following the promulgation of the\u00a0Novus Ordo Missae\u00a0in 1969, it was natural that it would be people who personally remembered the previous liturgical tradition who would seek it out. As time went on, with an extremely small number of public celebrations of the older Mass in the 1970s and 1980s (with exceptions to be noted), few younger Catholics would have any idea that \u201cthe Old Mass\u201d had ever existed. Furthermore, the peculiar Mass times favored by some bishops during the period from 1984 to 2007, when EF celebrations were possible throughout the world but needed episcopal approval, such as early in the morning or during the working day, further took it out of the reach of all but the retired. In that context, it is not surprising that the EF was often dismissed as an exercise in nostalgia, and that there would be a general expectation that demand for it would simply disappear. As Pope Benedict XVI expressed it, \u201cimmediately after the Second Vatican Council it was presumed that requests for the use of the 1962 Missal would be limited to the older generation which had grown up with it.\u201d7\u00a0However, as he adds, \u201cin the meantime it has clearly been demonstrated that young persons too have discovered this liturgical form, felt its attraction and found in it a form of encounter with the Mystery of the Most Holy Eucharist, particularly suited to them.\u201d Those who experienced the Mass before the introduction of the vernacular in 1965 are now of an advanced age: those 15 years old then would be seventy today. They are still to be found in EF congregations, of course, and occasionally the FIUV survey results indicate a congregation dominated by the old, perhaps for demographic or practical reasons. As a correspondent from Scotland laconically noted, of the weekday Low Mass which is the only public celebration in a rural diocese, those who attend are \u201cthose able to.\u201d The older generation can also overlap with the younger: as a correspondent from Chile expressed it, describing the local EF congregation: \u201cone part is older people (mainly women) and another part are young people (mainly men). There are practically no middle-aged people.\u201d It is worth noting that the implementation of the liturgical reform was delayed into the 1980s in parts of the Soviet Bloc, and in the People\u2019s Republic of China celebrations of the older Mass were widespread right into the 1990s. Mainland Chinese Catholics do not have to be very old to remember the EF as a normal part of the life of the Church, and priests are still to be found in active ministry who studied it as a standard part of their seminary training. Some Chinese bishops apparently see provision for the EF today as provision for the older generation, and some celebrants can be critical of the young people who encourage others to attend it. If they expect it to disappear with time, however, they are likely to be disappointed. As just quoted on the Chilean congregation, in many places there exists a middle generation which has missed out on the older liturgical tradition. In Europe and North America, where parochial politics is sometimes a key issue in arranging EF celebrations, it has become a well-worn trope that opposition comes from the \u201cBoomer generation.\u201d More significant is the attitude of the clergy of this generation, who are today the most senior, but still active, clergy in most dioceses, older in fact than many bishops. There are a number of references in the FIUV\u2019s survey results to this generation of clergy. A correspondent from the Baltics notes the \u201cinvisible pressure\u201d exerted on younger priests by senior clergy; one from Scotland notes \u201cideological divisions among the clergy, which tend to fall along generational lines\u201d; one from central Europe regards his Ordinary as \u201cquite supportive but surrounded by canons who are negative and vicious.\u201d An American correspondent worries about the atmosphere in his diocese\u2019s seminary, hearing from priests \u201cconcern that seminarians can suffer for expressing an interest in the EF. It\u2019s difficult to quantify but we get the impression that the hostility comes from the older generation.\u201d The influence of this particular generation of clergy is magnified not only by their seniority, but by the vocations crisis (in the developed world) of the 1970s and later decades. This means that the very oldest generation of active clergy remains numerically very significant in many dioceses. By contrast, one of the remarkable features of the development of the EF since\u00a0Summorum Pontificum\u00a0is the way that it has been taken up by some bishops. In a medium-sized Bishops\u2019 Conference like that of England and Wales, of the 22 Ordinaries we can count eight who have personally celebrated the EF.8\u00a0An earlier generation of bishops were urged by Pope John Paul II to be \u201cgenerous\u201d in response to the \u201crightful aspirations\u201d of Catholics attached to the former liturgy,9\u00a0but the contrast between the episcopal response to those exhortations (a response sometimes reiterated when\u00a0Summorum Pontificum\u00a0was published in 2007), and the view of the average bishop of today, particularly in the West, is startling. Even among those not personally interested in the EF, their attitude can be summarized by the phrase \u201copen mindedness\u201d: if the EF works for some people, and if it can be celebrated without causing practical difficulties, then they are happy for it to go ahead. We read of a bishop in the Philippines: \u201che has not opposed or hindered the EF but he has not encouraged it either.\u201d From the former Soviet Union: \u201cThe Ordinary is not really interested in promoting the EF, but neither in suppressing it.\u201d From the USA: \u201che is open and friendly to the EF. He does not push it, and isn\u2019t confronted with the situation frequently.\u201d The younger bishops today were born in the second half of the 1950s and early 1960s: too young to have taken a personal part in implementing the liturgical reform, and, increasingly, too young even to have felt its excitement, or trauma. It is not surprising if clergy just a few years older have much more emotional investment in the issue. The effect of the final retirement of the older generation of clergy, particularly from influential positions such as seminary rector, could make a substantial difference to diocesan policies towards the EF. Gender Balance10One issue noted in an earlier quotation (from Chile) was the number of young\u00a0men\u00a0who attend the EF. Although the FIUV survey did not ask a specific question on this issue, on a previous occasion I did request and received data from FIUV member associations about it. On the Ordinary Form side, there is abundant evidence from the USA and England and Wales that women outnumber men at celebrations, by about 2 to 1.11\u00a0As I learned from FIUV members, the Extraordinary Form does not conform to this pattern. From around the world I was given figures, for male participation in EF Masses, of between 50% and 75%; the average would seem to be about 55%. The percentages are only part of the story, however. It is clear anecdotally that many men at the Ordinary Form are there at the prompting of spouses or girlfriends, or out of a sense of duty towards children. At the EF it is more common to find that that in discovering it and adopting it as a regular form of worship men were acting spontaneously or taking the lead.12 This is not as surprising at it may seem, since the Eastern Churches, whose liturgy and spirituality have a good deal in common with that of the EF in atmosphere and ethos, also appear able to retain the allegiance of men, as does Islam and Orthodox Judaism. This is true even in the context of their Western converts living in the West.13\u00a0By contrast, there is a longstanding pattern of more progressive Protestant ecclesial communities having a severe imbalance in favor of women.14\u00a0It does not seem extravagant to propose, as a number of writers have done,15\u00a0a fairly simple correlation between liturgical style and an appeal to men, at least as a working hypothesis. Diverse Congregations16As well as preserving a balance between the sexes, the Extraordinary Form also seems to have the ability to attract a wide range of ethnic and linguistic groups. As an Italian contributor to the FIUV Report explained, his local EF celebration \u201cis frequented by people of all ages, several young couples with children, often Oriental (Sri Lankan) or even Africans (Congolese).\u201d A Canadian correspondent noted: Families with young children are very well represented in the congregations of both the churches where the EF is celebrated on Sundays. At one, there are also many young adults and seniors; those attending also come from many national/ethnic backgrounds, e.g., Canadian, American, British, Chinese (China, Hong Kong), Filipino, Indonesian, Vietnamese, Indian, Polish, German, South African, Australian, Korean, Trinidadian, Brazilian, Salvadorian, Mexican, Ivorian (Ivory Coast), etc. An extended explanation is given by a correspondent from Luxembourg. The population of Luxembourg is about 600,000 of which only half hold Luxembour-geois passports, but of these a great many came originally from Portugal, Italy and other places and many have never really integrated. As anyone who lives here will testify, Luxembourg is not a cultural melting pot like London but, rather, a ghettoised society in which each linguistic group sticks to its own. A very significant contributor to this phenomenon is the vernacular Mass. The Luxembourgish Mass, the Italian Mass, the Portuguese Mass, the English language Mass, the French Mass, the Polish Mass and so on are all focuses of attendance by the various expatriate communities. If you attend any of these you are unlikely to meet anyone whose native language is not that of the Mass you are attending. It is at the TLM that you will find a real mixture of ethnic backgrounds. There, you can meet people of Luxembourgeois, Hungarian, British, French, Polish, Japanese, Belgian, Italian, Nigerian, Austrian, Dutch and Spanish nationality, united by the common language of the Church: Latin. The danger of which this last correspondent speaks was noted by the 1994 Instruction of the Congregation for Divine Worship,\u00a0Varietates legitimae, which warned (49) that that the multiplicity of languages in worship might lead to \u201ca Christian community becoming inward-looking, and also the use of inculturation for political ends.\u201d What is true in Luxembourg is true, to an extent, in many cities where migrants are to be found. The Church faces a dilemma: either to put on celebrations of the Mass in a large number of languages, which apart from the practical challenges risks delaying the integration of these communities into the life of the diocese, or to fail to do this, risking large-scale alienation and lapsation. What is a dilemma for well-resourced dioceses in the developed world is simply an impossible situation in many African cities, where migrants even from within the same country can bring with them languages into which the Roman Missal has never been translated.17 The appeal of the EF to migrants is not just a matter of language. When migrants move from the countryside into the city, or from a less developed country into a more developed one, they are frequently (to speak in very broad terms) simultaneously making a transition from a more traditional society to a less traditional one. Those moving to Luxembourg, for example, from Portugal, let alone from Nigeria, may find the spirituality of the Church in their new home strikingly more individualistic and stripped down than what they are used to. It is not surprising that we should find some of them joining the ranks of those born into this culture who yearn for something more rooted, and who find it in the Extraordinary Form. ConclusionThe Extraordinary Form is today attended by a very tiny percentage of Catholics, which is why it is possible to take surveys of Catholics as a whole as a proxy for Catholics who attend the Ordinary Form. After thirteen years of rapid growth following the Apostolic Letter\u00a0Summorum Pontificum,\u00a0it is nevertheless becoming a phenomenon worthy of serious study. Such study is of particular importance to counter lazy or outdated characterizations of the Catholics attached to this Form of the Mass, and it is also needed insofar as the experience of the EF may have something to teach the Church as a whole. I hope that this paper will serve as a contribution to the debate on the place of the EF in the Church, and as a stimulus to further research. I have demonstrated that the association between the EF and young people and families is neither a myth nor something limited to certain countries. Most Catholics have never encountered the EF, but of those who do, mostly by chance, the ones who make it their preferred Form of Mass are disproportionately young, and include a disproportionate number of families with small children. The presence of numerous children at the typical EF celebration can be confirmed, indeed, by anyone willing to set foot in one, provided it is celebrated in a reasonably family-friendly time and place, and is reasonably well-established. The place of migrants, and in general of people of mixed cultural and linguistic backgrounds, at the EF, can be seen, naturally, only in places where the local population includes them. Nevertheless it is very evident in cities such as London, and as indicated in the statements quoted above, can be found in many countries. Easiest of all to confirm is the presence of men at the EF. With Ordinary Form congregations in many places being increasingly dominated by older women, the ability of the EF to retain at least equal numbers of men, as well as young people and those bringing up children, is of no small significance.

                "text": "Presidential fatigue is real, similar to the way the world felt about Justin Bieber, Pamela Anderson, or Flava Flav. So, naturally, the way to move past those feelings is to roast the position, the accolades, the ups, and the downs, as well as the man himself. That\u2019s right, Kalvin and Nick are here to Roast the (former) Presidents of the United States. No, not the most recent one (although we still take a few shots), but some of his predecessors who may boast a nose of epic proportions or an attempted BDM that didn\u2019t quite pan out leading to premature death! We round robbin through the 10s, \u201920s, \u201930s, and \u201940s of presidential eras, putting our own unique spin on what four different presidents brought to the table, and the crumbs they may have left behind. \n\n\n\nListen Here \n\n\n\nFull Episode Transcript Below: \n\n\n\nKalvin 0:07 Each week we dive deep into whatever it is we find interesting. I\u2019m your host, Calvin and joining me. I don\u2019t really want to say Washington, Washington DC right now because I could have a bad connotation. I don\u2019t know. Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. It\u2019s your co host, Nick Richardson. \n\n\n\nNick 0:26 I mean, that\u2019s tie with me, dude. It\u2019s \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKalvin 0:28 the original capital. \n\n\n\nNick 0:30 Right? And it\u2019s, it\u2019s the City of Brotherly Love. But people can be kind of dicks and mildly aggressive. But the food here is, \n\n\n\nKalvin 0:39 it\u2019s always sunny there, \n\n\n\nNick 0:40 too. It\u2019s Always Sunny there. And I mean, it\u2019s been for at least 15 seasons. \n\n\n\nKalvin 0:46 Yeah. At least. We The reason that Nick is in our nation\u2019s capital, and not current capitals, because it\u2019s a little dangerous in the current capital. So we went with the closest one, but we\u2019re gonna attempt to do a roast of some former presidents. \n\n\n\nNick 1:04 Yeah, a little levity in this time of depravity. \n\n\n\nKalvin 1:08 Yeah, we\u2019re gonna we\u2019re gonna try to keep it light. We\u2019ve each chosen two presidents. And we\u2019re going to kind of discuss first who they are. Maybe some of their accomplishments, and then we\u2019ll just proceed to roast the shit out of them as well as we can. \n\n\n\nNick 1:23 And just so you folks are aware, we will not be roasting Donald J. Trump. \n\n\n\nKalvin 1:28 Yes, I will. Try again, not to say his name. But I was getting there. \n\n\n\nNick 1:34 I mean, I think I\u2019ll just say he\u2019s not the Boogey Man. And the orange fella has lost its flavor. \n\n\n\nKalvin 1:43 Perhaps the most Roseville president ever we\u2019re not \n\n\n\nNick 1:48 thinking about these literally every, every time it\u2019s like, Fuck, I backed myself into a corner here. I just oh, \n\n\n\nKalvin 1:55 there may be some sideways jabs at him though. But I in my feeling, there\u2019s just enough controversy surrounding him right now that we\u2019re just gonna steer all the way clear of it. Because more than anything, we\u2019re trying to make this fun. And if we piled it on now, it would just kind of border on sad and angry. And that\u2019s not what we\u2019re here for. By the time this is releases, we will be on the verge of the inauguration. It\u2019s gonna release two days before the inauguration of President Elect Joe Biden. So we wanted to do something fun around that idea and not just sit here for an hour bashing the current incumbent. For that, check out like literally 67% of political podcast. \n\n\n\nNick 2:42 Oh, yeah. No doubt. No doubt. It\u2019s it\u2019s getting a little old. Plus, all these guys are dead, and they can\u2019t wield the long dick of the law to come after you. \n\n\n\nKalvin 2:52 Yeah. And so one person that talked about is not gonna be dead, because we will be doing a slight roast on Joe Biden at the end. \n\n\n\nNick 2:59 Yeah. \n\n\n\nKalvin 3:01 Yeah, gotta include the new incoming president here. He\u2019s the only one that\u2019s alive. You know how alive he is is debatable. But we\u2019ll get to that when we get to. \n\n\n\nNick 3:12 Fucking sleepy Joe. That is one of the best nicknames of all time. I\u2019m sorry. Yeah. \n\n\n\nKalvin 3:20 I mean, it\u2019s it\u2019s solid. And \n\n\n\nNick 3:23 it\u2019s solid. It\u2019s solid, Nick. \n\n\n\nKalvin 3:26 We don\u2019t want to be too harsh on Joe. We I mean, we got a lot to look forward to with him. \n\n\n\nNick 3:31 Calvin, this is a roast. Gonna leave that shit at the door. Just let it let it flow through you. We have two bros these men. Alright. \n\n\n\nKalvin 3:41 So we went with do the voice or tried to pick the president in the zero through 10 range 10 through 2020 through 30 and 30 through 40. And then obviously 46 at the end. So we\u2019re getting all the not really decades but different generation generations presence. There we go. So my first president that I picked is our country\u2019s eighth president Martin Van Buren. He was the president from 1837 to 1841. Among his accomplishments, he founded the Democratic Party, which is interesting, \n\n\n\nNick 4:17 get the fuck out of here, but \n\n\n\nKalvin 4:18 it was kind of like a it was kind of like a break off. He kind of destroyed the democratic republican party and built it into his own image. Right. \n\n\n\nNick 4:29 So come on, I\u2019m gonna crash this car and motorcycle \n\n\n\nKalvin 4:32 and Andrew Jackson together. Yeah, basically, that\u2019s what they did is they took all leftover and we\u2019re like, no, this is a new thing. Now, we\u2019re not that other thing. \n\n\n\nNick 4:39 And you can\u2019t have it. It\u2019s mine. He this I \n\n\n\nKalvin 4:44 don\u2019t know if this is an accomplishment, but it\u2019s definitely something that happened. he presided over the Panic of 1837 which is not a great thing to be tied to. \n\n\n\nNick 4:52 I don\u2019t think as I laugh about it \n\n\n\nKalvin 4:57 in in May of 1836 Seven state banks in New York refused to convert paper money to gold or silver because their hard currency reserves are low. So several financial institutions around the nation did same thing. This led to a five year economic depression in which banks failed and unemployment reached record highs. But luckily for Martin Van Buren, my boy, we\u2019ve now had three much worse depression. So no one ever talks about the Panic of 1837 Congrats, \n\n\n\nNick 5:26 note hansy laughter Yeah, it\u2019s like, oh, you\u2019re cute panic. Get out of town. \n\n\n\nKalvin 5:32 We\u2019ve had a great depression, a great recession. And whatever the hell we\u2019re in the middle of right now. So take my whole life. Yeah. Well, I don\u2019t think you were alive during the Great Depression. \n\n\n\nNick 5:44 Well, yeah. I don\u2019t know. Was I I don\u2019t know. \n\n\n\nKalvin 5:49 He\u2019s mortal whose first language wasn\u2019t English. His first language is Dutch. \n\n\n\nNick 5:55 Shit. Yeah. \n\n\n\nIt\u2019s interesting. Why was it Dutch? \n\n\n\nKalvin 6:01 Like I read about it, but I don\u2019t fucking remember. His his parents were Dutch immigrants or something like that. \n\n\n\nNick 6:08 It\u2019s probably something like he learned his father. \n\n\n\nKalvin 6:11 Abraham will know his native language was Dutch. Yeah, so he couldn\u2019t have learned that. \n\n\n\nNick 6:16 Well, such a Manimal that he was into chicks and his homeland of America. \n\n\n\nKalvin 6:23 His father Abraham, was a descendant of Cornelius Mason, a native of bermel son Netherlands, who had emigrated to New Netherland in 1631 and purchased a plot of land on Manhattan Island. So there you go. His grandfather was from the Netherlands and the Dutch just got passed down to generations apparently \n\n\n\nNick 6:44 like my story better. \n\n\n\nKalvin 6:45 Yeah. Trying to bone a chick straight out a little. \n\n\n\nNick 6:50 Hey, I said he was five. fuckin early riser. \n\n\n\nKalvin 6:54 Here\u2019s another great thing he did great and heavy quotations here. He attempted to restore the two party system with the Federalists and the democratic Republicans. That was with the help of Andrew Jackson as well. VAN BUREN believe that these national parties helped ensure that elections were decided on national rather than sexual or local issues, as he put it party attachment, in former times furnished a complete antidote for sexual prejudices. And now, we just have a mess. So thank you, Martin. Manveer. Great job. Thanks, \n\n\n\nNick 7:24 Martin, \n\n\n\nKalvin 7:25 Marty. Marty VB. \n\n\n\nNick 7:29 Marty van butts. \n\n\n\nKalvin 7:32 election of 1836 helped establish the second party system. By the end of the election cycle, almost all political factions have been absorbed by the democratic and the Whig parties. He was pushed into the presidency by Andrew Jackson because he wanted Andrew Jackson basically just wanted to continue controlling things. So he needed a puppet. And here comes the old Sly Fox as they call Martin Van Buren. \n\n\n\nNick 7:54 As one does, too. I mean, that is politics. You know, you have to have your puppets and your fucking do gooders and your fall guys. \n\n\n\nKalvin 8:04 Yeah. Martin Van Buren was a perfect example of that. During the election cycle, the Whig Party attempted to negatively frame Van Buren as an abolitionist to try and sway votes on a bad thing to be an abolitionist. \n\n\n\nNick 8:17 Oh, my God, like it\u2019s bad thing to be anti fascist. Oh, my God. \n\n\n\nKalvin 8:21 Well, I mean, it\u2019s 1837. So So war hadn\u2019t happened yet. I just thought that was interesting. But in actuality, our good friend Marty here. He posed abolitionists and made promises to keep slavery in states where it already existed to secure Southern votes. So he was just like, yeah, whatever you guys want. I\u2019m there for I\u2019m a lying piece of shit. \n\n\n\nNick 8:41 How about that? \n\n\n\nKalvin 8:42 He thought slavery was immoral, but it was sanctioned by the Constitution so that he that\u2019s where he stood is like, yeah, you guys can do this, but you should. \n\n\n\nNick 8:50 But I don\u2019t care. I mean, the Constitution says, guys. I live and die. But \n\n\n\nKalvin 8:56 yeah, he\u2019s got some more low lights here. he presided over the Trail of Tears, which if you remember your American history, that is the Native American relocation in the 1830s. He apparently had reached 19 treaties with Indian tribes in 1838. He ordered the forcible removal of all the tribes who had not yet complied. Move them all to Oklahoma. That\u2019s where you get your trail of tears. Yeah, the Cherokee were herded violently into internment camps when the relocation was stalled by intense heat and drought. And the government was supposed to supply wagons, rations, medical doctors, just nothing. Oh, of course. 1000 people were relocated against their will and many died. \n\n\n\nNick 9:36 That is fucking terrible. \n\n\n\nKalvin 9:39 Yes, Martin Van Buren, great prep. He, he couldn\u2019t quite complete the annexation of Texas or actually sorry. He didn\u2019t try to because he wanted to avoid a war with Mexico and didn\u2019t want to deal with any slavery tensions that would arise by annex in Texas. Would it be in the south would it be non slaveholding all that stuff. He just didn\u2019t want to deal with it. So he just didn\u2019t fucking do it. \n\n\n\nNick 9:58 That\u2019s one option. So \n\n\n\nKalvin 10:00 does Right. Yeah. He opposed the Americans involvement in Canada\u2019s revolution against the British. So he didn\u2019t want anything to do with that either. And anyone he caught helping the Canadians got arrested or, you know, whatever the fuck they did back in the 1830s burned at the stake like they were which. \n\n\n\nNick 10:16 Yeah, I mean, it\u2019s only tight when we do it. Fuck Canada, they can\u2019t do it. \n\n\n\nKalvin 10:21 It so it wasn\u2019t that Canada can\u2019t do it. He just didn\u2019t want to be involved in it. That\u2019s a that\u2019s a Ryan affair with my boy, Marty Bambi is uh, he just didn\u2019t want to do anything. Anything that may have resulted in a war. He\u2019s just like, Nah, fuck it. I\u2019m good. And pretty much in the 1830s. Pretty much anything you said or did would, could potentially result in a war? \n\n\n\nNick 10:42 So what do you think of this Martin? \n\n\n\nKalvin 10:45 Not my man. The Sly Fox. He was not full of anything. He was just there. Good for him. \n\n\n\nNick 10:51 Fuck it, use that. He\u2019s like that one politician from Parks and Rec. It\u2019s like a robot. But the great smile. You know which one I\u2019m talking about? It\u2019s in the fifth season. Yeah, \n\n\n\nKalvin 11:03 I can see Oh, yeah, that Ben goes and works for his campaign. I can see it in my head. But I couldn\u2019t place him in the actual Parks and Rec office. I\u2019m like, Wait, who was that? Like that? It? That\u2019s right. It wasn\u2019t there. It was when Ben went and worked in Washington. I get this fucking Marty. That\u2019s funny. Maybe? Yep. Hello. Yes, I can do that. Is it gonna cause war? No. All right. Yeah, we can do it. Oh, will cause war. Yeah, nevermind. We\u2019re not gonna do that. That\u2019s Martin Van Buren. \n\n\n\nNick 11:29 beautiful day outside no war. \n\n\n\nKalvin 11:32 vanburen viewed abolitionism as the greatest threat to national unity. \n\n\n\nNick 11:37 The fuck is wrong with this guy? Are you serious? \n\n\n\nKalvin 11:41 Yes, he resisted even the slightest interferences with slavery in the US. He also presided over the almost odd case, which there\u2019s a movie called Alma starred with Morgan Freeman, or some other Korean actors, that that this is all based on. But basically, there was a revolt on a Spanish schooner. That\u2019s a type of naval ship named la Amistad, Spain. And the revolt that was a slave ship, slaves revolted, took over the ship, I believe landed somewhere in the United States, Spain, one of their slaves back. They wanted all those guys back, US federal district court ruled that they are now free men and could just return home which I mean, I don\u2019t know that they have How the hell are they going to get back to Africa or wherever they came from? I\u2019m confused there. But you know, that\u2019s fine. I got to watch out apparently, \n\n\n\nNick 12:34 he\u2019s still another schooner. \n\n\n\nKalvin 12:35 Yeah, it\u2019s like two hours and 40 minutes long. \n\n\n\nNick 12:37 Jesus movie. \n\n\n\nKalvin 12:38 Yeah, it\u2019s been on my list for a long time. Just like I can\u2019t. It\u2019s too much to watch like a slave movie for that long live movies. Are \n\n\n\nNick 12:44 they so our man? That\u2019s why they show everyone roots in fucking Middle School. \n\n\n\nKalvin 12:50 They\u2019re like, Yeah, really good to a glory. It\u2019s it\u2019s really good and really interesting. It\u2019s just very hard to watch, because it\u2019s just brutal throughout the 12 years of slave, same thing. It\u2019s \n\n\n\nNick 13:01 just like, never watched it. And I don\u2019t know if I will. \n\n\n\nKalvin 13:06 That\u2019s pretty good. \n\n\n\nNick 13:07 I\u2019ve I\u2019ve heard that, but I\u2019ve just heard some horrible shit that\u2019s done and said in that movie. It\u2019s like, man, I just watch that. \n\n\n\nKalvin 13:15 Yeah, it\u2019s a rough watch. So the federal district court ruled that their Freeman Van Buren steps in he appealed the case all the way to the Supreme Court because he agreed that they should still belong to Spain. He I guess he probably didn\u2019t want to go to war with Spain over the slaves. \n\n\n\nNick 13:28 He\u2019s like, no, no. I mean, he\u2019s people\u2019s sovereignty. \n\n\n\nKalvin 13:32 That\u2019s not important. They\u2019re not people. \n\n\n\nNick 13:33 Yeah, no. \n\n\n\nKalvin 13:35 He loses in the Supreme Court to one john quincy adams comm a retirement to represent the slaves. They were deemed free and allowed to return home. The homicide case drew attention to the personal tragedies of slavery and attracted new support for the growing abolition movement in the north. It also transformed transformed the courts into the principle forum for the national debate on the legal foundations of slavery. So he accomplished something. He got slavery cases escalated, basically to supreme court level just because he\u2019s a dumb ass it thought that these people should be people. Because he thought he was fucking right. And it turns out he\u2019s just a dick. Well, no, he just didn\u2019t want to go to war Spain. \n\n\n\nNick 14:17 Yeah, let\u2019s be real. Yeah, fuck. I mean, I\u2019m, \n\n\n\nKalvin 14:22 I\u2019m telling you, I read through this whole Wikipedia page. Anything that came across is that that there was half a thought that it could lead to war. He was like, Nah, whatever we can do to avoid war. I\u2019m out of it. \n\n\n\nNick 14:33 It\u2019s like, hey, Marty. So Nah. Well, I mean, I just got Nah, I mean, seriously, we listen. We got this off with that. Just \n\n\n\nKalvin 14:44 somebody you\u2019re trying to go to war with us? I don\u2019t know. \n\n\n\nNick 14:47 I don\u2019t declare. To get you fucking lost. I can\u2019t Yeah, I\u2019m sure they didn\u2019t talk like they were. Well, I was gonna say in Old English. Get the fuck out of my office. With that bullshit war stuff, I don\u2019t want any of that. No, I\u2019ve never been in a fight. Why do you ask? \n\n\n\nKalvin 15:08 Boom, roasted. He ran for reelection in 1840 1844 and 1848 lost all three. They weren\u2019t particularly close either \n\n\n\nNick 15:19 students a fucking bomb. Yeah. \n\n\n\nHe\u2019s a fucking whack. But I wonder how old john quincy adams was to come out of retirement and still wipe the floor with this. \n\n\n\nKalvin 15:30 So here\u2019s our second president right in this guy\u2019s 1980s. So that\u2019s like, 80 years later, he\u2019s \n\n\n\nNick 15:36 doing this he was old as fuck. So I mean, this guy is probably like going through all kinds of gout and renal failure and all this stuff \n\n\n\nKalvin 15:44 with the Adams Jr. or something. And I just missed that. But yeah, it made a specific point of saying, john quincy adams. \n\n\n\nNick 15:51 Yeah, I don\u2019t want to scroll \n\n\n\nKalvin 15:52 through the whole thing to find them again. But \n\n\n\nNick 15:55 I don\u2019t think he had john quincy adams, Jr. I don\u2019t know. I think john adams was the junior \n\n\n\nKalvin 16:02 potential. I didn\u2019t study him for this. I studied Martin Manveer. Jesus, in 1848. in that election, he switched sides by running an anti slavery campaign. Now he\u2019s all for letting people be people. So way to go. \n\n\n\nNick 16:17 He\u2019s like, Oh, this is what they like. Alright, \n\n\n\nKalvin 16:21 so here you go. received no electoral votes in 1848. But 10.1% of the popular vote, which was the largest margin by a third party candidate up to that point, so he was a third party in 1848. And just got no electoral and that\u2019s when they\u2019re, like, 17 electoral votes for real. \n\n\n\nNick 16:39 It\u2019s, everyone\u2019s just like, hey, Marty. No, no, I was like, dang it. You know, \n\n\n\nKalvin 16:44 I don\u2019t want to go to war with you guys about this. But seriously, he was by far the best of all the worst losers, so good job money, man. \n\n\n\nNick 16:54 I wonder what it says on his headstone. It\u2019s like literally lost at fucking everything. Mark Van Buren, Marty Phoebe, \n\n\n\nKalvin 17:00 a lot of times he didn\u2019t even try a lot. That\u2019s why he didn\u2019t you know, if you try to lose, \n\n\n\nNick 17:06 if he doesn\u2019t have like a nerf basketball hoop on the back of his headstone. I don\u2019t even know. You\u2019re right. I don\u2019t even know if I can do this. Oh, wait, wait \n\n\n\nKalvin 17:16 till we get to my next pick. Because he may have been a bigger loser than my boy MVP here. \n\n\n\nNick 17:21 I did. I think I might have you beat. \n\n\n\nKalvin 17:26 Oh, we\u2019re gonna see. But most importantly, for Van Buren was that he had a new york city street gang named after him who secret sign was eight fingers because he was a president Van Buren boys. \n\n\n\nNick 17:38 That is, that is dumb as fuck \n\n\n\nKalvin 17:41 the amount of noise and listeners who haven\u2019t seen Seinfeld, it\u2019s most likely not a real thing. There was an episode of Seinfeld, that Kramer and George both got in some trouble with the Van Buren boys. And Kramer got out of it because he was holding the holding the salt shaker. In one hand, he had eight fingers, so they thought he was a former member, but George couldn\u2019t get out of it. He had some issues with the fanboys. \n\n\n\nNick 18:03 Did they? You know, asked him to fist fight. And then when he was like, okay, they were like, Nah, man, I don\u2019t do that thing. \n\n\n\nKalvin 18:11 I hate it. \n\n\n\nNick 18:12 Alright, I\u2019ll \n\n\n\nKalvin 18:13 explain it. So George was he\u2019s in charge of this foundation, he has to give someone a scholarship. And he meets this kid. And he\u2019s like a regular kid, instead of like one of the smarty pants kids that he\u2019s been interviewing all day. And he\u2019s like, I\u2019m gonna give it to him. Because he claims to want to be an architect, which is something George always pretended to want to be. And then he changed his mind decides he wants to be a city planner. And so George takes a scholarship away from it. And so this kid, Steven corn, he goes and joins the Van Buren boys. And then they try and shake George down, because George took the scholarship away. And they want him to get the scholarship back, \n\n\n\nNick 18:53 in shakey down the beam beer invoice. \n\n\n\nKalvin 18:56 And as George George tried to say it was a forum member, and they don\u2019t believe him. So they asked him for the secret sign and can\u2019t figure it out. And he does like this weird thing. And then they asked him to bug somebody and he can\u2019t bug anybody. It\u2019s a whole thing. Eventually, Jerry\u2019s parents walked by and he tries to like, talk them into pretending to be mugged, and it doesn\u2019t work out. \n\n\n\nNick 19:13 No shit. I kind of got a little \n\n\n\nKalvin 19:16 bit away from us, George. So it all comes back to Seinfeld. That\u2019s why I had to choose Martin Van Buren just so we could go to the Van Buren boys. And more notably, I\u2019m looking at his picture now, he probably should have been called Martin Van sideburns. Like this dude has the baddest ass sideburns I\u2019ve ever seen. They\u2019re just all over the place. And he lost. He lost his reelection to the Whig Party nominee, William Henry Harrison, who we\u2019re going to talk about soon, I think. And I just kind of say how do you lose an election to someone whose entire platform is based on fake hair. These Whig Party guys, that\u2019s all they care about. VAN BUREN is a bald guy standing up tall for his bald justices. And just as his disdain for the Whig Party is so strong that he grows as much hair as possible all over his head, other than on the Top to be like, I don\u2019t need a fucking wig. Look at this shit on \n\n\n\nNick 20:02 the side of my head. See this shit? It\u2019s like a broom. I can fucking clean house \n\n\n\nKalvin 20:07 major wigs \n\n\n\nNick 20:08 will fuck dude. That\u2019s why, you know the next guy, Harry Harrison. He\u2019s just thrown in Van Buren His face is like you like them apples, bitch. There was a I\u2019m looking at a photo of Martin Van Buren as a younger man. And he\u2019s a redhead. And that makes so much sense. He looks like he\u2019s 12 and he\u2019s bald. He\u2019s already got the sideburns. But he\u2019s already bald. He looks fucking tall. \n\n\n\nKalvin 20:35 And very creepy. \n\n\n\nNick 20:38 He literally looks like a fucking Hannibal Lecter. \n\n\n\nKalvin 20:43 He\u2019s like, yeah, \n\n\n\nNick 20:44 I\u2019m fava bean. But don\u2019t try to go to war with me. \n\n\n\nKalvin 20:49 Yeah, no, no, if you\u2019re gonna fight back then just go. Yes, sir. I don\u2019t eat your face that badly. \n\n\n\nNick 20:54 I don\u2019t even I don\u2019t even want it anymore. \n\n\n\nKalvin 20:57 Also nicknamed little van, he just seemed like the biggest wimp ever. Like, that\u2019s what it felt like to me, as I\u2019m reading through this. Like I said anything on the table that may have led to war. He just do nothing or Wait, wait it out, try and figure out a way to work it out that didn\u2019t involve war, which, like, I guess that\u2019s a good thing. You want to use diplomatic relations. But it seemed like every decision he made was just like, well, if we do that, it might cause a war. So I\u2019m not going to do that. yet. No fight even like it definitely will cause war. So I\u2019m not gonna do it\u2019s like, well, that might piss somebody off. So we don\u2019t want to make anything that everyone mad. And the other thing he did a lot to appease the slaveholders who helped elect him in his first election. So he kind of had these blinders on to the growing and progressive movement of abolitionism because he didn\u2019t want to piss them off either. So it doesn\u2019t want to go to war with anyone. He doesn\u2019t want to piss off the slaveholders. It just sounds really, really familiar. Kind of like, you know, might even be recent going on. \n\n\n\nNick 21:59 Yeah, some more legacy stuff. \n\n\n\nKalvin 22:02 Let\u2019s Let\u2019s have some blinders on to anything progressive, because that\u2019s because \n\n\n\nNick 22:08 change is scary. And he felt the same way. And you know, back in the back at that time, if people called you a little van, you fucking had duels over that shit. \n\n\n\nKalvin 22:20 where a woman was five, six, so he was a little \n\n\n\nNick 22:23 Damn. \n\n\n\nWell, I mean, at least he\u2019s harder to shoot. There\u2019s that. That that could have been like his calling card his fucking saving graces. He\u2019s a mad duelist with YuGiOh cards. \n\n\n\nKalvin 22:40 There we go. \n\n\n\nNick 22:41 You want to do all bro? Little Marty VB \n\n\n\nKalvin 22:47 that\u2019s Marty VB in a nutshell, \n\n\n\nNick 22:49 Martin, \n\n\n\nKalvin 22:51 you would fit in a nutshell. \n\n\n\nLittle van. Well, \n\n\n\nNick 22:57 this guy I don\u2019t know. I can\u2019t really say much else about this guy, but he\u2019s just kind of a fucking do we eat? Yeah, it\u2019s like your bastard. \n\n\n\nKalvin 23:09 It\u2019s hard to roast somebody. That\u2019s pathetic. \n\n\n\nNick 23:11 Well, fuck, how do you how do you inspire the population as this little five foot six hobbit man who is bald? has the most wicked sideburns. But you know, at the time, I\u2019m gonna say that\u2019s he was starting to get that in vogue. Like, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if Marty Vep actually started sideburns, which fuck him for that? Because sideburns. I\u2019m looking \n\n\n\nKalvin 23:35 at them right now. And he\u2019s got some mad sideburns going on. \n\n\n\nNick 23:39 Maybe? Well, I mean, he got torn to shreds by that dude. In the fucking court. \n\n\n\nKalvin 23:45 He\u2019s like, so that\u2019s why I looked at him. He he would have been 70 ish years old at the time of that. The Amistad case that is old as fuck. \n\n\n\nNick 23:53 Oh my god. \n\n\n\nKalvin 23:56 Especially in the 1800s Jesus Christ. \n\n\n\nNick 24:02 Yeah, I mean, that\u2019s, that\u2019s probably like talking to Ozzy Osborne. And he\u2019s still fucking lost to that guy. \n\n\n\nKalvin 24:07 Yeah, it\u2019s like using a court case to \n\n\n\nNick 24:10 Ozzy Osborne, or losing a court case to sly Stallone after Expendables five. Like, you know what, john quincy, you\u2019re fucking right. My man. \n\n\n\nKalvin 24:26 Who we got next, Nick. \n\n\n\nNick 24:28 We got this fucking punk bastard. William Henry Harrison, who just, you know, not vibing with him. He was the ninth president overall. And he surprisingly, had it had it pretty much laid out for him that he was going to be a president in some regard. He\u2019s the son of a founding father, at the time in the 18, you know, early 1800s are right around the turn of that timeframe. Whatever his claim to fame was mostly as a military commander, and he was part of that to come. So it confederacy Battle of tippy canoe, which kind of got him his nickname of old tippy canoe, which is like one of the shittiest streets in the town I live in, and it sums up this fucking douchebag pretty perfect. \n\n\n\nKalvin 25:20 He\u2019s almost 70 at the time of his press, he\u2019s \n\n\n\nNick 25:21 like, 68 is nice minus one. But, you know, that\u2019s where the old phrase typically new and Tyler to if I learned anything in school, it was that phrase, I still remember that shit. And as a major general in the army of the, during the war of 1812, he led a contingent of infantry and cavalry during the Battle of the teams in Canada. So Canada, once again, being involved in the early, you know, early \n\n\n\nKalvin 25:51 was the president in 1812. Actually let him fight in Canada. That was nice. Yeah, he\u2019s like, you know, my mighty Bambi he didn\u2019t want anything to do with Canada. He\u2019s like, I\u2019m fucking Canadians. \n\n\n\nNick 26:01 It\u2019s cool to shut up there. Listen, man, I\u2019m not doing it. Which, obviously, is that kind of catapulted this douchebag I mean, military service at that time, was absolutely. \n\n\n\nKalvin 26:16 Like every good leadership skills. \n\n\n\nNick 26:18 Yeah. If you could lead men to like that killed, you know, pretty innocent people for the most part and \n\n\n\nKalvin 26:24 Redcoats \n\n\n\nNick 26:24 Yes. Well, I mean, that\u2019s, there\u2019s a lot of Indians there. That\u2019s what really he was known for is, like, I don\u2019t know, just targeting Indian folks being extremely aggressive and terrible. He was actually assigned by the president at the time, john adams, to be the governor of the new Indiana Territory. So this guy is quite similar to a former governor of Indiana. \n\n\n\nYou\u2019re right. \n\n\n\nI mean, I \n\n\n\nyou knew I meant the fly on the wall that sees everything. And by wall I mean, very stiff hairspray hair. And he proceeded to be elected to the House in 1816. And then the Senate, and he ran for president in 1836. And lost to Marty Vbi. How the bullshit lost Mr. DVB? How do you how fuckin shitty Do you have to be to lose to Marty van side? \n\n\n\nKalvin 27:27 William Henry Harrison have any street gangs named after him? I don\u2019t think so. \n\n\n\nNick 27:31 Well, I mean, he has the sickest phrase in the entirety of the whole world. Tippie canoe and Tyler to and that\u2019s snazzy. At the time that probably get bras thrown at you. \n\n\n\nKalvin 27:42 Yeah, guy. That\u2019s probably what killed him. \n\n\n\nNick 27:47 call these tickets. Oh, my God. \n\n\n\nKalvin 27:49 Somebody just dropped it. \n\n\n\nNick 27:54 That just reminds me of like a family guys get or some shit. Yeah. hits the ground hardest, you know, he died in a way worse way. So he didn\u2019t really accomplish much, like really much at all. The only thing he did was kind of change how people receive their positions in Washington, or, you know, wherever he got them from at the time. He instead of, you know, people who just gave him a shitload of money. And he\u2019d be like, Alright, here\u2019s a cabinet position. They\u2019d have to give him a shitload of money and be his friend. \n\n\n\nKalvin 28:35 Oh, nice. Yeah, \n\n\n\nNick 28:36 I mean, that\u2019s, that\u2019s a tough bar, \n\n\n\nKalvin 28:38 I\u2019ve got coming up the reversal of that reversal. And with my next guy, \n\n\n\nNick 28:44 double reverse the mythological beast. So he kind of changed the game in regards to politicians getting endorsements at the time, but he kind of stuck to, you know, relatively if they were qualified. He kind of got the job. So he had that. Well, I didn\u2019t say that phrase Exactly. That they should burn down the capital. So I\u2019m totally innocent. Yeah, you know, I mean, what this guy\u2019s major mistake, really kind of just undoes even the tiny amount that he did. And he tried to, you know, bring the big dick energy. And he failed. He did not know. I mean, I\u2019m going to tell you all about all that Big Dig. \n\n\n\nKalvin 29:30 All that big energy got that lady to flash him and then he dropped it. \n\n\n\nNick 29:35 Okay, show me your tickets. And she\u2019s like, Alright, cool. And then he fucking died. \n\n\n\nKalvin 29:42 by William Henry Harrison death voice. \n\n\n\nNick 29:44 You get to throw a fart in there. There you go. We\u2019re fucking making history right now. We\u2019re gonna get a letter from someone that\u2019s like you dick. He was my great great uncle and I\u2019m offended. \n\n\n\nKalvin 29:58 So still represent the Whig Party to this day \n\n\n\nNick 30:01 straight up William Henry Harrison life. And then I\u2019m gonna text you and just say, See, I told you you had a gang. So this guy had the bright idea. He kind of developed a like a caricature around him of being a backwoods redneck idiot. So not not too popular. So he wanted to come out and display the he was really something special. He decided that it would be super tight for his inauguration in Washington DC, which is pretty far north if you\u2019ve ever been there, gets cold on a, on a nice rainy day. He wore no coat, no hat, no gloves, gave the longest speech \n\n\n\nKalvin 30:47 about us. \n\n\n\nNick 30:48 I mean, total badass. He\u2019s like, I\u2019m gonna, I\u2019m gonna teach everyone and talk forever, about nothing. And yeah, 90 minutes, it was like, almost 9000 words, which was, you know, people that time are like, Oh my God, this guy\u2019s fuckin genius. \n\n\n\nKalvin 31:05 You know, just as naked, that we\u2019re really showing him. \n\n\n\nNick 31:09 You know, instead, he died. It\u2019s debated. It\u2019s debated whether, you know, it was the weather or the fact that he drank shitty sewage runoff living at the White House, because apparently it was kind of like a thing. \n\n\n\nKalvin 31:26 at the inauguration flashing it. \n\n\n\nNick 31:30 Just, I mean, he\u2019s getting rapid fire titties. And he\u2019s like, Fuck, it\u2019s kind of like Christian just position cannot take this is what we\u2019re saying. I mean, he was what 68 he was. \n\n\n\nKalvin 31:47 When he died. I think it said, \n\n\n\nNick 31:48 nice. \n\n\n\nHe was in office for 33 days. 33 By far, the lowest amount, \n\n\n\nKalvin 31:58 actually, in \n\n\n\nNick 32:01 office, because it took so long to travel. I mean, he fucking died there. So there\u2019s that he probably wants to shut out of it. \n\n\n\nKalvin 32:07 Well, he died at the inauguration. \n\n\n\nNick 32:08 Now he died 33 days after the inauguration. \n\n\n\nKalvin 32:11 Okay, I see. I see. I\u2019m seeing the timeline now. So he spent all of his days as president on \n\n\n\nNick 32:17 basically. So what happened is he gave this speech. And then he developed a you know, cold and flu like symptoms, and then it just, he kind of went into fucking freefall. And on the 33rd day he died. And what\u2019s debated is where they received most of their groundwater and stuff like that for water at the White House was contaminated with feces and urine, and all the other nasty shit that humanity produces. And he was drinking it all up, but he was like, This shit is dynamite. So there\u2019s that. I mean, 33 days that\u2019s it. Fucking either a cold took him or shit water. pick your poison. \n\n\n\nI \n\n\n\nKalvin 33:02 am reading through his Wikipedia a little as you\u2019re going through it. Apparently the Whigs during the election of 1840 had been van bear nicknamed van Baron van ruin, \n\n\n\nNick 33:11 which All right, that\u2019s good. That\u2019s fair. Little van ruin. That\u2019s a sweet metal band. \n\n\n\nKalvin 33:17 That\u2019s pretty good. The Democrats in turn called Harrison granny Harrison. The petticoat? Rich? That\u2019s a sick burn. \n\n\n\nNick 33:25 Yeah, you got to do all right, Harrison. If anyway, like khorasani Harrison \n\n\n\nKalvin 33:29 Van Buren never would have said that because Harrison might have wanted to go to war with him. We can\u2019t have that. \n\n\n\nNick 33:34 Seriously. I mean, Harrison is the sickest dog on the face of the earth, literally, for 33 days. So I gotta say, what what was weird, and I find it interesting after this fucking idiot died because he was trying to be hard. And everyone knows that one kid in school. I won\u2019t wear jacket. Right who I were. His name was Tory. Shoutout Tory. Tory, yeah, you were an idiot. But he would walk around like sub zero temperatures in fucking shorts, and which his legs are blue and you don\u2019t feel it? Fucking great. I feel so good. It\u2019s like, dude. \n\n\n\nKalvin 34:18 So I went to elementary school here in Florida. And we would always kind of challenge each other who could go the longest into winter without wearing shorts or without wearing having to wear pants? Like, excellent. outside? Yeah, when it gets colder, says my daughter doesn\u2019t like she doesn\u2019t ever like to wear long pants. So always go in these little skirts or whatever. But yeah, I get it coming from here. But up there. No, no. Yeah, \n\n\n\nNick 34:43 I mean, there were days where it\u2019s like minus 20. We\u2019re walking home from school and it\u2019s snowing and he\u2019s just like, yeah, \n\n\n\nKalvin 34:49 then how would people know you\u2019re a badass? \n\n\n\nNick 34:52 I don\u2019t know. He wore pink shoes a lot to secure, they\u2019re on sale. For you. Tory\u2019s \n\n\n\nKalvin 34:59 gonna own that \n\n\n\nNick 35:00 Pretty much He\u2019s a fucking goob and his parents were swingers. So yeah. \n\n\n\nKalvin 35:09 You know, we\u2019re gonna let the the short slide now. It seems like he needs some help. \n\n\n\nNick 35:17 No, he\u2019s all right. He\u2019s doing well. I think he works for Apple or some shit. \n\n\n\nKalvin 35:21 Nice. \n\n\n\nNick 35:22 Yeah. sweatiness decor from California. He\u2019s a guy\u2019s This sucks out here. Sorry for fucking cold pants all the time. This is bullshit. And that he\u2019s like, you know, I I talked to that head honcho, I talked to Mr. Cook You know, he said I could cut off all my my jeans and make them shorts. \n\n\n\nKalvin 35:40 So how did we get to roasting some random dude named boy? Because he\u2019s William Henry Harrison here. \n\n\n\nNick 35:46 We\u2019re roasting a generation. Well, it\u2019s I guess it\u2019s generational of men who just really tried. It doesn\u2019t work. You just hit me with this little dick energy and it sucks. It just sucks so much. \n\n\n\nKalvin 36:00 It works up until the point you fall ill with pneumonia and are on bed on your deathbed for 33 days and eventually die bleeding. President ever because seriously, \n\n\n\nNick 36:10 you couldn\u2019t do anything. You literally could not do anything. And afterwards. There was a there was a constitutional crisis. So it called attention to ambiguity in Article two, section one clause six of the Constitution regarding succession to the presidency. It clearly states provided for the vice president to take over the powers and duties of the presidency in the event of the President\u2019s removal, death by ship water and or pneumonia, resignation or inability because he\u2019s dying. But it was unclear whether the vice president formally became president of the united states are simpler, simply a tow. Well, \n\n\n\nKalvin 36:51 don\u2019t worry, because that never fully got worked out. \n\n\n\nNick 36:53 It did, actually. And here\u2019s how. Because it ties in. No, no, it did. Because typically wait \n\n\n\nKalvin 36:59 till I get to my guy named Well, wait, \n\n\n\nNick 37:01 let me finish the sentence. Fine. \n\n\n\nKalvin 37:03 What is john Tyler have to say? I \n\n\n\nNick 37:05 said everyone else was liars. And he\u2019s like, Yeah, no, I\u2019m super the president. And I\u2019m not that\u2019s one way to do it. Therefore I am. \n\n\n\nKalvin 37:13 And because I\u2019m the president, and I said I\u2019m the president. ipso facto I am the president. Alright, so I get where john Tyler\u2019s coming from but I\u2019m telling you that the trickle down of that did not I guess they didn\u2019t write it down well enough after this fiasco. Because it comes back to haunt you later \n\n\n\nNick 37:32 comes back to haunt you. But you know what haunts me the most Calvin \n\n\n\nKalvin 37:37 this cool like face his \n\n\n\nNick 37:38 guru like face this fucking guy has the skinniest face I\u2019ve ever seen \n\n\n\nKalvin 37:44 a dream about this face tonight? He looks like the guy not a good one. Oh, dude, he \n\n\n\nNick 37:47 looks like the congressman from the first x men who slides through goddamn bars in prison. Hey, I don\u2019t like to typically make fun of people\u2019s noses. And surprisingly, in all these wars \n\n\n\nKalvin 38:00 looks like it\u2019s dripping off his face. \n\n\n\nNick 38:02 It looks like it would have icicles hanging from it in a storm. Like you would hide under it in case of a meteor shower. And it\u2019s been broken at least twice. And at the same time, I feel like it\u2019s just an extension. This gentleman he has short hair that looks like grease slick to the top of his head with Vegeta sighs widow\u2019s peak. It\u2019s basically if you don\u2019t know Vegeta it\u2019s Dragonball Z. And he has the most wicked I \n\n\n\nKalvin 38:31 know that right? \n\n\n\nNick 38:32 You know the most wicked widow\u2019s peak on Earth. This guy is probably what inspired Akira Toriyama to create that. He looks like a fucking idiot. His eyebrows are touching. And it basically just runs into his goddamn nose, which is literally the biggest nose I\u2019ve ever seen on a human being. There\u2019s a side portrait of him. And this shit sticks out farther than his chest. This man had got a little bit \n\n\n\nKalvin 39:00 of Saul Goodman look to him in his younger days. \n\n\n\nNick 39:03 He looks like Napoleon Bonaparte got stretched on the rack. \n\n\n\nKalvin 39:09 But just his face. \n\n\n\nNick 39:10 Honestly. How the fuck did this guy get anyone to marry him? I don\u2019t understand. He\u2019s like Frankenstein\u2019s albino cousin money. Money is a good one. \n\n\n\nKalvin 39:26 Every man got married because they had money back then pretty much. \n\n\n\nNick 39:29 It\u2019s like that kid in college who is you know, gets the chick that\u2019s way out of his league. And then you\u2019re in a, you know, a party with everyone and he busts out the cocaine and you\u2019re like, yep. Now I know why. That\u2019s Martin. That\u2019s not Martin. William Henry Harrison in a nutshell. \n\n\n\nKalvin 39:47 Talking about Tory again here. No, \n\n\n\nNick 39:49 I\u2019m not actually back on him. He was handsome. He \n\n\n\nKalvin 39:56 also had a cocaine problem. Apparently, he\u2019s addicted. I\u2019m sorry now we\u2019re just defaming this Tory fellow for no reason. I don\u2019t know if you have a cocaine problem and I\u2019m sorry you do \n\n\n\nNick 40:08 if you do. So this William Henry Harrison guy, there\u2019s a picture of him and Donald Trump next to each other and like a million check marks on it. Or tally marks. Look at the same time. See, guys if you\u2019re if follow along with this, Google these people and go to Image Search. There\u2019s one of him. This motherfucker had a bun, like a full blown fun. \n\n\n\nKalvin 40:32 I\u2019m good with the man bun. \n\n\n\nNick 40:34 No, it\u2019s not a man bun. It\u2019s like a bun that takes up the entirety of the back of his head. It\u2019s like a dinner he\u2019s Targaryen braid. I bet he had significantly better acting now. \n\n\n\nKalvin 40:47 It would be hard not to. \n\n\n\nNick 40:50 I does \n\n\n\nKalvin 40:52 will kill me This is already dripping with emotion. \n\n\n\nNick 40:55 I love I love that analogy. He\u2019s just it\u2019s dripping. \n\n\n\nKalvin 41:01 just dripping. Yeah. Oh, yeah. See, there\u2019s the bread. Shit. I\u2019m \n\n\n\nNick 41:05 saying. \n\n\n\nKalvin 41:06 I might grow one of those. I kind of like it. \n\n\n\nNick 41:08 Don\u2019t you fucking dare. Calvin, don\u2019t you do it? are we \n\n\n\nKalvin 41:13 are we done with Sir William Henry Harris. \n\n\n\nNick 41:16 We\u2019re done. Fuck that Jabari. So we\u2019re moving \n\n\n\nKalvin 41:19 into the 20s we got president number 21 Chester, a Arthur \n\n\n\nNick 41:25 Chester\u2019s or Lester a Arthur. \n\n\n\nKalvin 41:28 Nana molester that we know of just kind of put that out there before we get a defamation lawsuit from the Arthur foundation. his presidency ran from 1881 to 1885. I just kind of randomly chose two single term presidents like I knew it was gonna be Van Buren because the Van Buren boys from Seinfeld. And then I was just looking through the 20s. And I\u2019m like, Chester, he seems like a guy we can make fun of. and turns out we can\u2019t Yeah, don\u2019t worry about \n\n\n\nNick 41:54 easy target, Chester. So to all you listeners, don\u2019t name your kids that \n\n\n\nKalvin 41:59 just a fair warning, Chester. How do we ever elect a guy named Chester? \n\n\n\nNick 42:05 I don\u2019t know we we get a lot of weird fucking idiots. \n\n\n\nKalvin 42:10 So it was a civil war vet, which is nice. He in he enforced the Pendleton civil service Reform Act. So this is what double reverse your reversal from your last guy here where the Pendleton civil service Reform Act mandates that most positions within the federal government should be awarded on the basis of merit instead of political patronage, which again now has been triple reversed and nobody gives a shit. \n\n\n\nUnknown Speaker 42:35 It\u2019s just a free for all. Yeah. \n\n\n\nKalvin 42:39 Oh, you tweeted something nice about me. Here you go. Here\u2019s the cabinet position. \n\n\n\nNick 42:42 Yeah, here\u2019s a cabinet. You\u2019re woefully unqualified. But this \n\n\n\nKalvin 42:45 isn\u2019t just like the cabinet and things like that. This is postal workers, you know, any federal employees even on local levels, because apparently there was some corruption going on. The one instance I read up was postal workers, that would be like Star postal routes that people get promoted to based on kissing other people\u2019s asses and not because they were good postal workers. So yeah, there\u2019s a lot of that. \n\n\n\nNick 43:12 What the fuck did they gain from being a good postal. \n\n\n\nKalvin 43:15 And I know new man was trying really hard to be a good postal worker because he wanted to get transferred to Hawaii. Because that\u2019s the mother of all postal routes is Hawaii. But in 1881, that wasn\u2019t going on because Hawaii didn\u2019t exist. I mean, it existed. It just wasn\u2019t American. probably kill you. \n\n\n\nNick 43:33 He showed up there like, Hey, I\u2019m here to deliver a pack. \n\n\n\nKalvin 43:37 Chester also presided over the rebirth of the US Navy. \n\n\n\nNick 43:43 For ships. \n\n\n\nKalvin 43:45 This is post Civil War. So that there they had a lot of these ironclad ships coming on board. There\u2019s there\u2019s a lot of stuff going on in the \n\n\n\nNick 43:50 ships. There was a shitload of stuff going on. I could talk for hours about naval battles in the Civil War. But I digress. Right, he\u2019s like, so let me stop you right there. \n\n\n\nKalvin 44:01 Yeah. He failed to alleviate the federal budget surplus. And just like what the fuck is going on in the 1880s? Like, let\u2019s get a budget surplus going nowadays. Let\u2019s get that money. Go to Burlington Coat Factory. Give us a surplus. Come \n\n\n\nNick 44:15 on, you can get so much. So you\u2019re telling me he failed to eliminate a surplus. We just didn\u2019t spend it. He was like, \n\n\n\nKalvin 44:22 No, they had the surplus leftover from the civil war that nobody since the end of the Civil War had been able to bring down foreigner. So they just kept spending and spending and well, so another one of his problems is they would there was like some river reclamation project that they that was was put over on his desk, right? And he wouldn\u2019t sign it because he thought it was to national base that didn\u2019t include enough local help or whatever. So a lot of things. He was another guy a lot of things came across his desk. He was like, Nah, I\u2019m not gonna do that. See, I\u2019m doing nothing right now. And that seems like I would have to do something. So I\u2019m gonna stick here. Do \n\n\n\nNick 45:07 you see what I\u2019m doing? It\u2019s pretty fucking tight. \n\n\n\nKalvin 45:11 He signed the Chinese Exclusion Act, which put a 10 year ban on Chinese immigration, which I guess that a lot of the issues during Reconstruction from the civil war were blamed on Chinese immigrants. So they want to crack down on Chinese immigration. Anyways, the initial bill was for a 20 year ban on Chinese immigration. he vetoed that one and they came back with a 10 year ban and that\u2019s the one he passed. So it\u2019s like \n\n\n\nNick 45:35 I\u2019ll do half Yeah, hit me with half and I\u2019ll be I want \n\n\n\nKalvin 45:39 to go check \n\n\n\nNick 45:40 that I\u2019ll be Xena. Xena phobic as fuck I don\u2019t even care. I don\u2019t even care just I don\u2019t want to go to war, \n\n\n\nKalvin 45:46 made a super weak effort to secure bid for reelection in 1884 due to his poor health and he just retired at the end of his term. So that was Chester. And like I said, How do we elect to do name Chester The truth is Chester, one of the most cornball last names you could \n\n\n\nNick 46:06 ever have the most widespread and he overcame it somehow. \n\n\n\nKalvin 46:09 Yeah, he overcame it became president but we didn\u2019t elect it. He replaced James A Garfield after Garfield was assassinated four months into his turn. \n\n\n\nNick 46:18 Damn, Garfield was on the heels of William Henry Harrison. Yeah. \n\n\n\nKalvin 46:25 They don\u2019t want any of this this Lincoln shit where they\u2019re in office for two years before they get assassinated. They\u2019re like, I\u2019m in get me now. \n\n\n\nNick 46:31 Just hit me up. Let the club go down. I mean, Chester, let me just say that right now. \n\n\n\nKalvin 46:41 So I Manchester was only the vice president because Garfield wanted a East Coast stalwart is what they\u2019re called, that was like this. As basically, you would compare it to a political action committee or a PAC nowadays. That\u2019s what they were back then. It was like a faction of the Democratic Party. I think they were Democratic Party, maybe Republican. Yeah, Republican Party, sorry. So the East Coast stalwarts or the eastern stalwarts, they were a super powerful faction within the Republican Party. And so the only reason Garfield chose him was so those people would help Garfield out so they would use their sway to get Garfield \n\n\n\nNick 47:24 sounds a little like cheating just saying this cornbread motherfucker \n\n\n\nKalvin 47:33 somewhat and so Garfield was even shot by someone who thought Arthur would then appoint him to a federal position because they had that that same stalwart affiliation. But Arthur did not appoint this guy that shot he\u2019s you know, that \n\n\n\nNick 47:49 was a weird conversation he went on I\u2019ll shoot that motherfucker right now. \n\n\n\nKalvin 47:54 Well, I\u2019m even up to the point of his trial and everything he thought he was going to be pardoned because he claimed to be affiliated with the the eastern stalwarts. Chester\u2019s late now fucking \n\n\n\nNick 48:03 seen him in my life. Yeah, my dude. Oops, sorry. He\u2019s like, Hey, are you gonna kill him? I\u2019ll fucking help you out. I got this sweet pistols. \n\n\n\nKalvin 48:15 Just re Arthur didn\u2019t do a lot. It\u2019s very hard to roast him because he was so nonplussed about everything. But luckily Wikipedia gave me some great rose from his contemporaries. Because other people were more than happy to shoot \n\n\n\nNick 48:33 me with these, you know, \n\n\n\nKalvin 48:35 this is from journalists Andrew Alexander mccluer. No man has ever no man ever entered the presidency so profoundly and widely distrusted as Chester l&r and no one ever retired, more generally generally respected alike by political friend and foe. So everyone hated him when he came in and he\u2019s respected afterwards because he did fucking nothing. He just rolled \n\n\n\nNick 48:58 whatever dude with three first names. I don\u2019t trust it. \n\n\n\nKalvin 49:02 Ricky Bobby, it\u2019s got two first names. \n\n\n\nNick 49:05 I don\u2019t trust that shit. \n\n\n\nKalvin 49:06 Yeah, three first names. Chester, \n\n\n\nNick 49:08 especially Allen Arthur. \n\n\n\nKalvin 49:10 Never trust the guy named Justin. \n\n\n\nNick 49:12 I mean, my Stranger Danger alarms are going off right now. \n\n\n\nKalvin 49:17 So at his death, the New York world which is a newspaper of the time, quoted no duty was neglected in his administration and no adventurous project alarm the nation. He signed papers that were put in front of them but did nothing else Yeah, \n\n\n\nNick 49:31 fuck this guy, is what you\u2019re saying. \n\n\n\nKalvin 49:33 Like no in. In 1935, historian George F. Howe noted that Arthur achieved and obscurity and strange contrast to a significant part in American history. \n\n\n\nNick 49:45 That\u2019s, I mean, that could be conceived as a good thing. I think. \n\n\n\nKalvin 49:50 I think there\u2019s ages nobody fucking remembers it. I didn\u2019t remember him till I read his name on the list of presidents dude. I \n\n\n\nNick 49:54 don\u2019t remember three quarters of the Presidents they just there\u2019s that\u2019s true completely. oblivious to me. \n\n\n\nKalvin 50:03 Also got some some great sideburns going on here too. And I think that is what being a president meant is you had to have the craziest side. \n\n\n\nNick 50:14 You had to have some kind of dope ass facial hair. This dude has \n\n\n\nKalvin 50:18 set you apart from your opponents. \n\n\n\nNick 50:19 Oh, fuck this dude sideburns look like a hippies pubes. Jesus on James \n\n\n\nKalvin 50:25 Corden shit here like that. He is not \n\n\n\nNick 50:29 like dragon shoulders man. The fuck? What do you \n\n\n\nKalvin 50:34 think we need to bring the sideburns back for presidents To be honest, let\u2019s let\u2019s just make that the President presidential thing. And for your four to eight years, you have to try and grow better sideburns than your predecessor. And if at the end of your first four years you haven\u2019t grown better sideburns, you\u2019re out. I don\u2019t care. \n\n\n\nNick 50:48 I mean, \n\n\n\nKalvin 50:51 if you have any more years to set the record on best side, you gotta have a we get \n\n\n\nNick 50:55 to. I mean, I think that definitely helps. That\u2019s why they grew cybers it\u2019s like damn, so my chin is weak as fuck. Let me so what let\u2019s \n\n\n\nKalvin 51:04 say out of our five most recent presidents, who do you think could have grown the best cyber? I think Obama could have had some dope sideburns. \n\n\n\nNick 51:14 I know it\u2019s easy \n\n\n\nKalvin 51:14 to just say Obama\u2019s always gonna be the coolest everything because he\u2019s one of the coolest people ever. Right and Jeff, \n\n\n\nNick 51:20 I think honestly, I think Bill Clinton would have had the dopest sideburns would have \n\n\n\nKalvin 51:26 went on like for if this was a presidential mandate Yeah. Clinton would have went for it Clinton has no shame so like he did just fucking down there with it. He he\u2019d have the Chester A Arthur mixed with the Van Buren sideburns all the way up he\u2019d go like into the the Ron Howard How the Grinch Stole Christmas like the mayor from from that movie. He\u2019d go side by side straight into like the the points up in the middle part. I like that Clinton \n\n\n\nNick 51:56 fucking back then apparently. added all you need is a weak chin and a shit name. In your fucking in like five \n\n\n\nKalvin 52:04 bad names for the presidency. \n\n\n\nNick 52:06 This guy looks like a Bowl champion. He is fucking wack. \n\n\n\nKalvin 52:12 I think we can agree that george w bush would have the worst sideburns. \n\n\n\nNick 52:15 I think they would have been all patchy and should be like, yeah, this is a victory. He \n\n\n\nKalvin 52:19 didn\u2019t say like Hey, girl phobia. \n\n\n\nNick 52:21 No, I just can\u2019t. I can\u2019t I can\u2019t Dude, I\u2019m 27 years old. I still have patches in my fucking facial hair. It\u2019s ridiculous. I can grow great mustache. But you know, no one wants to see a Payless dude with really dark hair. Have a mustache? It just looks weird. \n\n\n\nKalvin 52:39 Shout out Jay from the VCR kids. \n\n\n\nNick 52:41 J my boy. You and me both let\u2019s have a mustache growing contest. \n\n\n\nKalvin 52:47 I mean, he\u2019s already beaten you there cuz he has \n\n\n\nNick 52:49 I can grow a mustache in like three days, like a \n\n\n\nKalvin 52:54 challenge has been laid down \n\n\n\nNick 52:55 has been laid down and I they were part of the butter beer situation too. Right. \n\n\n\nKalvin 53:01 Butter. Okay. That was just no, that was my, my wife sister was the one that confirm that. \n\n\n\nNick 53:08 Okay. Well, I challenge her to a sweet mustache contest. You went? Yes. \n\n\n\nKalvin 53:15 We also had some Chester A Arthur birthers. At the time. His opponents claim that he wasn\u2019t a US citizen and did not live in the US until he was 14. This was disqualified him from being vice president. If it were true. It wasn\u2019t record keeping in the 1800s if he could guess was pretty fucking bad. And his family moved around a lot like within Vermont in New York. So he attended a lot of different schools and just check out last track. Or at least that\u2019s the story The Arthur\u2019s are going \n\n\n\nNick 53:42 well. I mean, he\u2019s the most underwhelming person I\u2019ve ever seen. So then again, he\u2019s very underwhelmed. So don\u2019t you remember me? No, I don\u2019t. \n\n\n\nKalvin 53:51 I think the best thing you could say about Chester A Arthur is that he was efficient at doing his job. He was so great at supplying armies moving through New York during the Civil War, that they just kept promoting him and promoting him higher and higher class, just because he always kept the deliveries on time. Everybody liked working with him. He was just so great at doing that shit. He was an absolute monster when raising campaign funds for his campaign or other party members. Like before he was running for president. He would help out the party and getting people elected and raising funds. He was also so good at his position in the customs office, that he was able to earn a salary higher than the president over $50,000 based on commissions that he got off of imports. So at the time, whoever these customs officials were if they were the one facilitating the import, they got a commission off of that. And he was so good at and everybody liked working with him so much that he rate that he his normal position paid 60 $500 a year he only earned over $50,000 a year doing that job \n\n\n\nNick 54:54 Jesus that does that sound okay? That sounds not good. \n\n\n\nKalvin 55:00 He\u2019s just efficient man. People \n\n\n\nNick 55:02 like working. Yeah, he\u2019s fingers. You know, he\u2019s a fishin. Yeah. And \n\n\n\nKalvin 55:07 the worst thing you could say about Chester A Arthur is also that he was efficient at doing his job. And that seems to be all that there was to him just get the job done adequate \n\n\n\nNick 55:17 and make a load of money. Yeah, \n\n\n\nKalvin 55:20 it\u2019s really great for like your accountant or if you\u2019re supplying the militia in New York, but when you\u2019re president, you gotta have a little bit more gusto. Mostly just a pencil pusher. If he was told to sign something, he\u2019d sign it Damn. And he\u2019d do it quicker than any other president. Unless \n\n\n\nNick 55:33 it was war. He\u2019d be like, No, \n\n\n\nKalvin 55:36 I was Van Buren that would avoid war. Well, I \n\n\n\nNick 55:37 mean, they I mean, they\u2019re all buddies. They have the \n\n\n\nKalvin 55:40 sideburns. That\u2019s true. sideburn Bros \n\n\n\nNick 55:43 for life. \n\n\n\nKalvin 55:45 But if something like really needed to happen, he wasn\u2019t gonna be the one to do it. Like he\u2019s not the guy you call in an emergency. \n\n\n\nNick 55:50 Most of these guys aren\u2019t. Most of them are just fucking weak chin bitches. \n\n\n\nKalvin 55:56 All right, let\u2019s go to your last. Unless you got something else on Manchester. I \n\n\n\nNick 56:00 don\u2019t other than fuck him. \n\n\n\nKalvin 56:03 And fuck jesters all over the world. Yeah. Either Chester and you\u2019re listening this unsubscribe until you change your name. \n\n\n\nNick 56:10 Why would you go through your life introducing yourself as Chester, because my first thought, which is? Yeah, surprisingly, so he had at least political experience. He, he really just grovelled a lot and sucked mad about a dick. And he he made it to the top. He he was a war vet. So this guy. You know, he had a deferment, because he was a birthright Quaker. So religious exemption. But he he volunteered for the Navy and basically just dealt with logistics. He took the easiest route he possibly could like this dude did nothing when he was overseas. But he still went overseas so he can claim war veteran status. He was elected, elected as a congressman in California\u2019s 12th district, after his opponent couldn\u2019t be defeated because of all the infighting within his party. So a group of 100 republicans got together and elected this bitch asked motherfucker, because he was handsome, and a good speaker. That\u2019s pretty much what it came down to. And he fucking hated communism. \n\n\n\nKalvin 57:23 And that\u2019s what you need to know America is \n\n\n\nNick 57:24 awesome. But communism did Oh, he was like the king of, you know, working up the anti communism fervor. He just, he dropped it all the time. So in 49, he begins to consider running for senate as a, you know, against the Democratic incumbent enters the race, and basically just has the shittiest primary Battle of his life. But he sent out this this little thing, and it was called a pink sheet.

So Nixon, of course, won in a landslide by nearly 20 percentage points, but this is where his stupid fucking nickname comes into play. He was known as tricky dick, which just makes me think of STDs. I don\u2019t know why. It\u2019s a tricky dick. \n\n\n\nKalvin 58:34 Yeah, tricky ticket. It\u2019s not a big ticket. \n\n\n\nNick 58:37 He\u2019s got that. Yeah, tricky Duke Energy. And eventually he became Eisenhower\u2019s Vice President, Vice President, mostly because he was young, like really hated communism. And that was publican, hailing from there. Surprisingly, this dude actually accomplished a decent amount of stuff that we appreciate today. He created the EPA. He signed Title Nine, banning gender based discrimination and education. He only thinks that these are all good things, but I\u2019ll get to the punchline. He he desegregated schools peacefully lowered the age of voting to 18. But he had this one major mistake and it was like a hinge point for this man. You kind of missed \n\n\n\nKalvin 59:21 something here.

                "title": "Blog: Will Brexit Be a Barrier for Retooling the Economy? \u2013 The National Interest",
                "text": "The ghost haunting the British economy is low productivity. A study covering 2007\u20132016 shows a productivity growth per year of 0.1 percent, below Germany, France and Spain and at par with Italy. In 2015, just before Brexit came on stage, productivity in France was 27 percent and in Germany 35 percent higher than in Britain. Since then, until 2019 it has risen in the eurozone with 2.4 percent, Germany 3.1, France 3.4, Spain 1.5 and Britain on a par with Italy at 0.5 percent. \nInexplicably, no one has bothered to discuss whether Brexit will enhance productivity constituting the most serious barrier for retooling the economy.\u00a0\u00a0 \nEducation is vital, but feedback from universities paint Brexit as more harmful than helpful. The Erasmus Programme, orchestrating student exchange among EU member states, has scored high marks from teachers and students. Britain has left the program, which was regarded as a boon for students and a boost for British universities.\n \nThe Galileo satellite navigation program unmask how costly it is to launch programs on the edge of high-tech. After Brexit, Britain will not participate in its operation and development. The plan to build a more or less similar national system was abandoned because of costs. An alternative is being considered, but it will be neither easy nor cheap. These kinds of programs may in the long run engineer spin-offs that benefit the economy as a whole. Inside of the EU, the cost-benefit through cost-sharing may have been profitable for Britain. Outside of the EU, the cost-benefit turns against Britain. \n \nLower regulatory framework is mentioned as an arrow in the quiver to stimulate the economy, albeit it is questionable to say the least, why Britain should be able to throw off various regulations after having left the EU. Much of the red tape is not a result of EU membership, but due to domestic pressure. The support for the protection of the environment, climate change, and safety and health are strong. The unions\u201423.5 percent of workers equal to 3.7 million are still members\u2014would certainly resist any deterioration of working conditions.\u00a0\u00a0 \nThe Christmas Eve agreement contains a clause about the level playing field. It can be taken for granted that the EU will move fast in case Britain tries to work around that commitment. Prime Minister Boris Johnson\u2019s request to business leaders on Jan. 7, barely two weeks after the agreement was struck, to help rip up regulations will lead to raised eyebrows and is more likely than not to trigger off a confrontation with the EU. It is the kind of political signals that gives rise to suspicion about duplicity. With such a policy in mind leaving without an agreement might have been preferable.\n \nThe idea of deregulation as an instrument to turn Britain into \u201cSingapore-on-Thames\u201d is alluring in the eyes of some Brexiteers, but the result is much more likely to be \u201cBangladesh-on-Thames.\u201d Cutting labor costs is the competitive parameter chosen, not higher productivity. Most economists would be immensely reluctant to recommend such a course\u2014for political, social and economic reasons. \nNor does freedom to enter into free trade agreements (FTAs) with non-EU countries, hold much promise. No clarification is at hand to impart why productivity should go up because of FTAs, why Britain outside the EU should be able to trade more with third countries than inside and why FTAs which focus on goods while Britain\u2019s competitive edge is found in services will boost the economy.\u00a0\n \nSo far, FTAs have been concluded with seventy countries, but sixty of those means that trade will continue with the country in question on exactly the same terms as the EU agreements entered into when Britain was a member\u2014a kind of rollover.\u00a0 \nThe hard nut to crack is that not only must productivity growth be achieved, but it must be higher than for competitors already in the lead.\u00a0\u00a0\n \nA big financial commitment is required. Where is the money though? The national debt is at its highest level since the early 1960s. The corporate sector looks close to a rerun of the high indebtedness in the slipstream of the Global Financial Crisis. Investment from outside is becoming less attractive without access to the Single Market. \nThe EU agreed last year on a stimulus of \u20ac1.8 trillion to rebuild a post-coronavirus Europe. The ambition is a greener, more digital and more resilient Europe. Somewhat heretically, maybe Britain should have stayed inside the EU, agreed to this program and used it to modernize the economy. Isn\u2019t it exactly what the British government would love to do? Also, the EU has not run into obstacles when looking for finance.\n \nJoergen Oerstroem Moeller is a former state-secretary for the Royal Danish Foreign Ministry and the author of\u202fThe Veil of Circumstance: Technology, Values, Dehumanization and the Future of Economics and Politics, ISEAS, Singapore, 2016.\u202f\u202f\u00a0 \nImage: Reuters",

                "text": "The English poet and story writer Rudyard Kipling passed away on 18th January in 1986. He was one of the first masters of the short story in English, and he was the first to use Cockney dialect (the manner in which natives of London, England\u2019s East End speak) in serious poetry. Early lifeJoseph Rudyard Kipling was born on December 30, 1865, in Bombay, India. His father was professor of architectural sculpture at the Bombay School of Art. In 1871 Kipling was sent to England for his education. In 1878, Rudyard entered the United Services College at Westward Ho!, a boarding school in Devon. There young \u201cGigger,\u201d as he was called, endured bullying and harsh discipline, but he also enjoyed the close friendships, practical jokes, and merry pranks he later recorded in\u00a0Stalky & Co.\u00a0(1899). Kipling\u2019s closest friend at Westward Ho!, George Beresford, described him as a short, but \u201ccheery, capering, podgy, little fellow\u201d with a thick pair of spectacles over \u201ca broad smile.\u201d When Kipling sent some of these to India, his father had them privately printed as\u00a0Schoolboy Lyrics\u00a0(1881), Kipling\u2019s first published work. SchoolingRudyard Kipling\u00a0and his sister Alice were sent to England for education. The children stayed with another British couple, Holloways for six years from1811 to 1877. Kipling and his sister were not happy during their stay at Mrs. and Mr. Holloways. The two children used to visit and stay with their maternal aunt in London during school holidays. In 1878, Kipling was admitted to United Services College at Westward. Kipling met Florence Garrard during his\u00a0stay in this college. She became a model for her in his first novel,\u00a0\u201cThe Light that Failed\u201d.  The family did not have sufficient funds to continue him in a university, without a scholarship. The family decided to find a job for Kipling in Lahore (British India). Mr. Kipling found a job in a newspaper office, The Civil and Military Gazette. His job was to assist the editor of the local newspaper. Back to IndiaImmediately on his arrival to Bombay, Rudyard Kipling found his childhood memories rushing back. On moving around among the familiar sights and sounds, native words, whose meanings he did not know, began to tumble out of his mouth. He now put up with his parents, then posted at Lahore and began his career as a copy editor for the \u2018Civil and Military Gazette.\u2019 His parents were not officially important, but still commanded certain respect. Therefore, he had access to the highest echelon of the British society. Concurrently, he moved around in the native neighborhoods, absorbing the colorful life of the native Indians. Thus he had the opportunity to observe the whole spectrum of the social fabric. With an unstoppable urge to write, he now began to fill his notebook with light verses and prose sketches. In the summer of 1883, he visited Shimla, a well-known hill station and the summer capital of India. He must have liked the place very much for from 1885 to 1888, he made yearly visit to the place. The town featured prominently in many stories he wrote for his newspaper. In 1886, he had his first work, \u2018Departmental Ditties\u2019, a book of witty verses, published. Concurrently, he continued to write short stories, among which, at least thirty-nine were published in the Gazette between November 1886 and June 1887. In November 1887, Kipling was transferred to Allahabad. Here he worked until early 1889 as an Assistant Editor at the Gazette\u2019s sister paper, \u2018The Pioneer.\u2019 The period was literarily very productive. II In January 1888, he had his first book of short stories published from Calcutta (now Kolkata). Titled, \u2018Plain Tales from the Hills\u2019, it contained forty short stories, out of which twenty-eight were pre-published in the Gazette in 1886/1887. Also in 1888, he had six other collections of short stories published. They were \u2018Soldiers Three\u2019, \u2018The Story of the Gadsbys\u2019, \u2018In Black and White\u2019, \u2018Under the Deodars\u2019, \u2018The Phantom Rickshaw\u2019, and \u2018Wee Willie Winkie\u2019. In all, they contained forty one stories, some of which were quite long. During this period, he also traveled extensively in the western region of Rajputana as the special correspondent of \u2018The Pioneer.\u2019 The sketches he wrote during this period were later included in his 1889 publication \u2018From Sea to Sea and Other Sketches, Letters of Travel\u2019. Fame in EnglandIn 1889, Kipling took a long voyage through China, Japan, and the United States. When he reached London, he found that his stories had preceded him and established him as a brilliant new author. He was readily accepted into the circle of leading writers. While there he wrote a number of stories and some of his best-remembered poems: \u201cA Ballad of East and West,\u201d \u201cMandalay,\u201d and \u201cThe English Flag.\u201d He also introduced English readers to a \u201cnew genre [type]\u201d of serious poems in Cockney dialect: \u201cDanny Deever,\u201d \u201cTommy,\u201d \u201cFuzzy-Wuzzy,\u201d and \u201cGunga Din.\u201d Kipling\u2019s first novel,\u00a0The Light That Failed\u00a0(1891), was unsuccessful. But when his stories were collected as\u00a0Life\u2019s Handicap\u00a0(1891) and poems as\u00a0Barrackroom Ballads\u00a0(1892), Kipling replaced Alfred, Lord Tennyson (1809\u20131892) as the most popular English author. The American yearsIn 1892, Kipling married Caroline Balestier. They settled on the Balestier estate near Brattleboro, Vermont, in the United States, and began four of the happiest years of Kipling\u2019s life. During this time he wrote some of his best work\u2014\u00a0Many Inventions\u00a0(1893), perhaps his best volume of short stories;\u00a0The Jungle Book\u00a0(1894) and\u00a0The Second Jungle Book\u00a0(1895), two books of animal fables that attracted readers of all ages by illustrating the larger truths of life;\u00a0The Seven Seas\u00a0(1896), a collection of poems in experimental rhythms; and\u00a0Captains Courageous\u00a0(1897), a novel-length, sea story. These works not only assured Kipling\u2019s lasting fame as a serious writer but also made him a rich man. His imperialismIn 1897, the Kiplings settled in Rottingdean, a village on the British coast near Brighton. The outbreak of the Spanish-American War (1898; a short war between Spain and the United States over lands including Cuba and the Philippines) and the Boer War (1899\u20131902; a war between Great Britain and South Africa) turned Kipling\u2019s attention to colonial affairs. He began to publish a number of solemn poems in standard English in the\u00a0London Times.\u00a0The most famous of these, \u201cRecessional\u201d (July 17, 1897), issued a warning to Englishmen to regard their accomplishments in the Diamond Jubilee (fiftieth) year of Queen Victoria\u2019s (1819\u20131901) reign with humility and awe rather than pride and arrogance. The equally well-known \u201cWhite Man\u2019s Burden\u201d (February 4, 1899) clearly expressed the attitudes toward the empire that are implied in the stories in\u00a0The Day\u2019s Work\u00a0(1898) and\u00a0A Fleet in Being\u00a0(1898). Kipling referred to less highly developed peoples as \u201clesser breeds\u201d and considered order, discipline, sacrifice, and humility to be the essential qualities of colonial rulers. These views have been denounced as racist (believing that one race is better than others), elitist (believing oneself to be a part of a superior group), and jingoistic (pertaining to a patriot who speaks in favor of an aggressive and warlike foreign policy). But for Kipling, the term \u201cwhite man\u201d indicated citizens of the more highly developed nations. He felt it was their duty to spread law, literacy, and morality throughout the world. During the Boer War, Kipling spent several months in South Africa, where he raised funds for soldiers\u2019 relief and worked on an army newspaper, the\u00a0Friend.\u00a0In 1901 Kipling published\u00a0Kim,\u00a0the last and most charming of his portrayals of Indian life. But anti-imperialist reaction following the end of the Boer War caused a decline in Kipling\u2019s popularity. When Kipling published\u00a0The Five Nations,\u00a0a book of South African verse, in 1903, he was attacked in parodies (satirical imitations), caricatures (exaggerations for comic effect), and serious protests as the opponent of a growing spirit of peace and democratic equality. Kipling retired to \u201cBateman\u2019s,\u201d a house near Burwash, a secluded village in Essex. By now, Kipling had reached the peak of his popularity. Other than \u2018Kim\u2019, \u2018Just So Stories for Little Children\u2019 (1902) and \u2018Puck of Pook\u2019s Hill\u2019 (1906) were two of his most famous works of the early 1900s. At around the same time, Kipling became involved in politics, making appeals on various issues on both sides of the Atlantic. During the First World War, he enthusiastically wrote pamphlets and poems, supporting the UK\u2019s war effort and made sure his son John was recruited in the army despite having short eye sight. In 1915, John went missing, never to be found. Kipling expressed his grief in his poem \u2018My Boy Jack\u2019 (1916). After the war he joined the Imperial War Graves Commission and described his experience in a moving story called \u2018Gardener\u2019. Kipling continued to write until the early 1930s, albeit at a slower pace. \u2018Tales of India: the Windermere Series\u2019 published in 1935, is probably the last publication during his lifetime. His autobiography, \u2018Something of Myself\u2018, was published posthumously in 1937. TriviaThe first three stories of \u2018Just So Stories for Little Children\u2019 were first published in a children\u2019s magazine. He was required to tell them, \u2018just so\u2019 (as they have been published) to little Josephine at bedtime. When after her death, he published these stories in book form, he named it \u2018Just so Stories\u2019. Awards & AchievementsIn 1907, Rudyard Kipling received the Nobel Prize in literature \u201cin consideration of the power of observation, originality of imagination, virility of ideas and remarkable talent for narration which characterize the creations of this world-famous author\u201d. In 1926, he received the Gold Medal of the Royal Society of Literature The post ON THIS DAY \u2013 18th January Death Anniversary of Rudyard Kipling is Observed appeared first on Study Falcon.",

                "text": "Although international ratings for Russian President Vladimir Putin and Chinese President Xi Jinping are overwhelmingly negative, they remain higher than those of President Trump.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWith President-elect Joe Biden set to take office this week, how does the rest of the world view the United States after four years of President Donald Trump? \n\n\n\nIt\u2019s unsurprising that in the wake of the January 6 insurrection at the US Capitol building, America\u2019s international neighbors ran articles with titles like \u201cAnarchy in the US\u201d (in the United Kingdom\u2019s Metro Newspaper) and \u201cTrump plunges US into chaos\u201d (in the Netherlands\u2019 De Telegraaf). \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to a survey from the Pew Research Center, America\u2019s reputation has steadily declined since Donald Trump\u2019s inauguration and the international community now views the US less favorably than at any point since the center began polling on the question nearly twenty years ago. \n\n\n\nJust 41% of those in the UK, 31% in France and 26% in Germany expressed a favorable opinion of the US, with German and French opinion equal to what it was in March 2003, at the start of the Iraq War.\u00a0 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe poll, which takes into account 13,273 respondents in 13 countries, reflects skepticism over the route the country has taken during Trump\u2019s four years in office. \n\n\n\nWhen did this regression begin?\n\n\n\n\u201cSeveral high-profile policy and political differences have exposed fault-lines in the bedrock of the trans-Atlantic relationship,\u201d Tommy Goodwin, an expert in international public policy and political affairs, tells TMS. \n\n\n\n\u201cStarting with various trade disputes in the Iraq War in the 2000s, the EU and its Member States came to view the US more skeptically which began to erode their collective trust in the US, its leaders, and its broader commitment to multilateralism and multilateral institutions like the EU itself,\u201d says Goodwin. \n\n\n\nIn 2017, at the annual G-7 Summit where the world\u2019s economic powers gather, leaders appeared simply relieved that the US president was even there. \n\n\n\nWhat\u2019s more, at the end of the summit, Trump refused to certify the customary joint communiqu\u00e9 delineating the group\u2019s priorities for the future. Shortly thereafter, he withdrew the US from the Paris Agreement on climate change. Trump then spent the remaining years of his term criticizing the North American Treaty Organization (NATO), calling the European Union America\u2019s \u201cfoe,\u201d withdrawing from the Iran nuclear deal and imposing tariffs on European trade. \n\n\n\nUnsurprisingly, this led to heightened tensions. The same Pew survey reveals that only a third of respondents across the EU countries hold a positive view of the US. \n\n\n\nIn fact, although international ratings for Russian President Vladimir Putin and Chinese President Xi Jinping are overwhelmingly negative, they remain higher than those of President Trump. \n\n\n\nAs for other world leaders, an average of 76% across the 13 nations have confidence in German Chancellor Angela Merkel. The majority also hold favorable views of French President Emmanuel Macron while ratings are roughly split for British Prime Minister Boris Johnson. \n\n\n\nAnalysts suggest that such views on a country generally coincide with confidence in its leadership. That would indicate that an average of only 16% of those surveyed have confidence in President Trump. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUS COVID-19 response\n\n\n\nAs for the coronavirus outbreak, favorable views of Trump\u2019s response also correspond to support for right-wing political ideology. Although ratings are still low among both groups, those who lean right are more likely to think the US has done an adequate job handling the pandemic. \n\n\n\nStill, every nation surveyed ranks the US the lowest in its response to the coronavirus. Few of the 13 nations surveyed endorse America\u2019s response and only 15% believe the country\u2019s handling of the pandemic was effective. \n\n\n\nOnly 6% in South Korea, 7% in Denmark and 9% in Germany believe the US has handled the pandemic well. \n\n\n\nAlternatively, in all 13 countries polled, nearly 80% say the US has handled the virus poorly and all but two of those say that the US has done a \u201cvery bad\u201d job dealing with the outbreak. \n\n\n\nAnother poll, this one by the European Council on Foreign Relations (ECFR), found that just 2% of Europeans surveyed believe the US was a \u201chelpful\u201d ally in the fight against the coronavirus. \n\n\n\nThis sentiment was particularly striking in France and Germany, where 46% and 42% said their opinion of the US worsened \u201ca lot\u201d during the pandemic.\u00a0 \n\n\n\n\u201cThe proportion of respondents who felt that the U.S. had been a key ally through the crisis was vanishingly small, with the largest proportion in Italy, at just 6%,\u201d the report noted. \n\n\n\nGermany\n\n\n\nAccording to the survey, Germans hold some of the most unfavorable views of the US, with only 26% maintaining a positive view of the US and a mere 10% confident in President Trump\u2019s handling of international affairs. \n\n\n\nThe polls are a glaring juxtaposition to the favorable assessments Germany had of America under President Barack Obama\u2019s administration. At that time, 84.5% of Germans reported feeling confidence in the sitting US president. \n\n\n\nBelgium\n\n\n\nTrump\u2019s least favorable assessment is in Belgium, where only 9% say they have confidence in his handling of world affairs. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDenmark\n\n\n\nDenmark holds the most prominent gender gap, with 42% of men rating the US favorably, compared to only 26% of women. \n\n\n\nSpain\n\n\n\nA larger share of Spain views the US positively in 2020 than in 2017. However, not as many Spaniards view the US as positively as did during President Obama\u2019s time in office. \n\n\n\nSpain also maintains a similarly large gap to Denmark in terms of gender, with 48% of men and only 33% of women rating the US favorably. The gender disparity in other countries polled is roughly 10%. \n\n\n\nSupporters of the Spanish Vox party, a far-right populist party, are also significantly more likely to hold favorable opinions of the US under President Trump, with 73% of Vox-voters holding a favorable opinion of the US, compared with only 29% of those who view the far-right party unfavorably.\u00a0 \n\n\n\nThose surveyed in Spain maintain the most optimistic assessment of the US response to COVID-19, with a total of 20% stating the US handled the pandemic well. \n\n\n\nThe positive effect of the Trump presidency\n\n\n\nDespite the overwhelmingly negative perception of Trump, some analysts argue his presidency has had a positive effect on nations worldwide. \n\n\n\nSuch experts point to Trump\u2019s insistence that EU leaders encourage expansion and reform, an idea Emmanuel Macron echoed in his speech at the Sorbonne in 2017. He suggested that the conditions that allowed the EU to thrive after World War II were no longer present and that further integrating other nations in the EU would benefit the union. \n\n\n\nAnalysts have also argued that Trump encouraged self-sufficiency within the EU, whether consciously or unconsciously, by showing that the union could no longer rely on America. \n\n\n\nThese critics can also point to Trump\u2019s decision to support the \u201cThree Seas Initiative,\u201d the purpose of which is to create cooperation among 12 EU nations to counter Chinese and Russian power. \n\n\n\nLikewise, President Trump effectively launched a new trade war with China, which some believe to have been beneficial for America\u2019s allies. \n\n\n\n\u201cThe election of President Trump ignited the EU-US relationship powder keg. For a region and policymaking system highly dependent on multilateral institutions, consensus building, and incrementalism, Trump\u2019s \u201cAmerica First\u201d foreign policy and impatience with global institutions stood in direct contrast to the foundational elements of the EU,\u201d Goodwin says. \n\n\n\n\u201cTrump was a shock to the European system and set the stage for the new geopolitical EU we see emerging today.\u201d \n\n\n\nStill, despite the minority who view Trump\u2019s presidency auspiciously, it\u2019s clear that the majority look toward January 20 \u2013 the day of President-elect Biden\u2019s inauguration \u2013 with optimism. \n\n\n\n\u201cIf anything, President Biden is an institutionalist,\u201d Goodwin says. \u201cHe served in the US Senate for 36 years (including as chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee) and as US vice president for eight years. During this time, he has demonstrated a deep and long-standing commitment to global and multilateral institutions. That\u2019s why the EU can expect somewhat of a return to normal service under President Biden.\u201d \n\n\n\nNevertheless, Goodwin believes that \u201cEurope is unlikely to forget that the long-standing US-EU relationship is still only an election away (in 2024) from a return to uncertainty and destabilization across Europe.\u201d \n\n\n\nHave a tip or story?

                "title": "Denial of American Fascism Has Cost Us Dearly",
                "text": "Published on\u00a0Sunday, January 17, 2021 byCommon Dreams The inconvenient truths about fascism, like learning about the climate and health crises, could lead us to actually shift our beliefs and lives.   byZolt\u00e1n Grossman\u00a013\u00a0CommentsProud Boys march in support of President Donald Trump in Washington, DC, December 12, 2020. (Photo: Evelyn Hockstein/For The Washington Post via Getty Images) For too long, our country and our communities have been in denial about the rise of far-right authoritarianism and the enabling of fascism.\u00a0 For how many months and years have anti-fascist researchers and activists been warning that an attempted coup against democracy would happen, in some form? How many times have we seen eyes glaze over, hearing only condemnations of \u201cboth sides,\u201d or dismissive comments minimizing serious fascists as merely \u201cpatriot conservatives,\u201d cosplay \u201cclowns,\u201d or stupid \u201crednecks\u201d?\u00a0 We heard it when Trump was elected, we heard it the next year when far-right militants and death threats\u00a0besieged our college, and last year when three\u00a0far-right paramilitaries\u00a0roamed and\u00a0held rallies\u00a0in Olympia.\u00a0 Our own police and city leaders hyped the threat of antiracist protesters, and turned a blind eye to three paramilitaries armed with semi-automatic rifles, bear spray, and zip ties, even\u00a0rewarding a cop\u00a0who had her photo taken with them. There was less government and media reaction to two\u00a0far-right shootings\u00a0in December than to earlier Black Lives Matter protests. There were clear cases of a biased double standard, in both Washingtons, and we saw the results last week. \"If four years ago, our country leapt from the frying pan of neoliberal corporate rule into the fire of enabling fascism, on January 20 we\u2019re leaping back from the fire into the same old frying pan. Unless we see deeper changes, we\u2019ll be back in the fire before long.\" \u00a0 \u00a0 As Olympia city council member Renata Rollins just said, \u201cLocally we\u2019ve had a collective delusion that the violent alt right would go away if the racial justice protestors would just tone it down \u2026 It was convenient to believe that right-wing violence was coming from a desire for 'law and order.' That if we didn\u2019t say anything, at least maybe they\u2019d leave us alone.\u201d In other words, if we ignore them, and decide not to counterprotest, they won\u2019t go away. \u00a0 \u00a0 Fascism Denial\u00a0 What we're now seeing is the consequences of years of \u201cFascism Denial\u201d by conservatives, liberals, and many progressives. As I\u00a0wrote\u00a0after the 2018 Pittsburgh Massacre: \u201cJust as climate change has gradually crept into our lives, and we notice it only when a major storm, drought, or flood dramatically announces its presence, fascism has gradually crept out from under its racist rocks that have long been embedded in our society, and we only notice when it erupts in violence. We try to deny the crisis, or explain it away as part of some other, more easily grasped issue, rather than facing the realities head on....\u201d\u00a0 In 2020, the Center for Strategic and International Studies found that far-rightists carried out\u00a067% of the year\u2019s domestic terror attacks, and that in the previous decade far-rightists had\u00a0killed 117 people.\u00a0Only one was killed by an anti-fascist, who then became an\u00a0American assassinated on American soil, next door to Olympia.\u00a0 There\u2019s a long historical pattern of western powers downplaying the rise of fascist movements, focusing their wrath instead on leftist movements. In the 1930s Depression, they mainly feared socialist revolutions and union strikers, and they enabled a fascist rebellion to overthrow a leftist democratic republic in Spain. Leftists from around the world, who had warned their own countries about fascism, volunteered to fight in Spain, but were defeated, paving the way for World War II. In effect, the western powers left the gates of civilization unlocked, for the fascists to take over. Only when Pearl Harbor was attacked did the U.S. finally wake up that fascism was the real global threat. Even then, the leftists who had fought in Spain were officially persecuted as \u201cpremature antifascists.\u201d\u00a0 Now the liberals and conservatives are so damned surprised by last week\u2019s far-right \u201cPearl Harbor.\u201d The police literally left the gates to the U.S. Capitol and\u00a0Governor\u2019s Mansion\u00a0unlocked and open to the fascists, and were unprepared and slow to deploy forces, in contrast to their advance overreactions to many BLM protests. The D.C. mob was so unused to police pepper spray that they used water to wash it out of their eyes, which BLM protesters know not to do.\u00a0 Our leaders may finally wake up far-right paramilitaries and QAnon cultists are a literal threat to democracy, and there\u2019s no \u201cdialogue\u201d or \u201cconversation\u201d possible with their leaders. \u00a0Even then will they continue to ignore those of us who repeatedly warned them, and dismiss us as \u201cpremature antifascists\u201d? Or will they start to listen to the fact that without deep, systemic social and economic change, the fascist cancer will continue to metastasize? It is not just enabled by Trump in the U.S., but is in the global context of the rise of right-populist authoritarianism, from Hungary and Turkey to Brazil and the Philippines. Fascism shouldn\u2019t just be a label we put on meanies we don\u2019t like, but represents a specific violent ideology, and a reaction of deep-seated local nationalisms against the impersonal placelessness of corporate globalization.\u00a0 Our wars abroad and the wars at home mirror and reinforce each other. In our foreign policy, the Pentagon and CIA under both parties have backed coups of far-right dictators and death squads, to maintain elite rule and corporate profits. In many parts of the world, this is who we are. They called any dissent from below an \u201cinsurgency\u201d or \u201cinsurrection\u201d that has to be put down, one of the reasons I don\u2019t use those terms to describe the attempted coup from above in D.C. Americans think that coups have to always involve soldiers and shooting. But there have been right-wing political coups against leftist governments, like in Honduras in 2009 and Bolivia in 2019, more successful versions of Trump\u2019s failed attempt to steal the election. On 1/6, just like on 9/11, U.S. leaders were so shocked when the goons that they backed to stop their enemies carried out a violent blowback against democracy, biting the hand that fed them.\u00a0   Not your grandparents\u2019 fascists\u00a0 If the rise of fascism is a global pandemic, then white nationalism is the main U.S. variant of the virus. But today\u2019s American fascists don\u2019t fit the old simple stereotype of Nazis and Klansmen. Their organizers often hook recruits first with legitimate grievances such as opposing corporate trade deals and Big Tech, Pentagon militarism, and even sex trafficking and pollution, and only later reveal their true agendas. Far-right conspiracy theories are not just influencing Trumpian rednecks, but our own friends and families. Most of the groups are mainly motivated by white nationalism, but others are motivated by Christian nationalism (against Muslim or Jews), so-called \u201clibertarian\u201d reactions to gun rights, health measures, and public lands, so-called \u201cPatriot\u201d opposition to immigration and Indigenous rights, or cis het supremacy and misogyny.\u00a0 Northwest far-right groups (such as Patriot Prayer) recruit token people of color through these other ideologies, and love to showcase them, or even use pro-gay rhetoric to oppose Muslim immigration. Not all fascists are white supremacists (remember that Japan was an Axis Power), and more importantly, not all white supremacists are fascists. So we can\u2019t fool ourselves that defeating far-right shock troops is all we have to do to confront the much larger and pervasive, deeply rooted institutional power of white supremacy.\u00a0 I\u2019d caution anyone who assumes last week\u2019s violence will discredit and demoralize the far-right. I did notice that they took the stickers off many of their vehicles parked near the January 10 Capitol protest in Olympia. I remember when the so-called militias declined dramatically after the Oklahoma City bombing in 1995, and it took them some years to recover. But there wasn\u2019t the QAnon cult or social media back then, so I think they\u2019ll step up their irrationality and regroup more quickly this time.\u00a0 We might also assume that the far-right and Republicans dividing or splintering from each other will make things safer. But our experience in the Midwest was the opposite--the far-right is even more dangerous when they're down to the hard core, and remember that in the Mideast, ISIS was formed in a split away from Al Qaeda, whom they saw as softies. So smaller crowds does not necessarily mean the far-right is less of a threat in the short term, but it does mean they have less of a social base to persevere in the long term (much like ISIS). The good news is that rightists usually hate and fight each other even more than leftists do.\u00a0 Some of us might also assume that the far-right threat will decline with Trump leaving office. That may be the case, but losing power could also unleash them untethered to any restraints, as we\u2019ve seen in Michigan. We cannot assume Biden will adequately meet the challenge. If we simply try to \u201creturn to normal,\u201d we forget that the normality of social and economic inequalities is what gave us Trump in the first place.\u00a0 If four years ago, our country leapt from the frying pan of neoliberal corporate rule into the fire of enabling fascism, on January 20 we\u2019re leaping back from the fire into the same old frying pan. Unless we see deeper changes, we\u2019ll be back in the fire before long.\u00a0  Instead of effectively meeting the challenge of far-right militancy, proposed federal legislation against \"domestic terrorism\" or \"extremism\u201d is so vague and broad that I fear it will be used against dissenters who are practicing and defending democracy (like Black Lives Matter protesters and water protectors blocking oil pipelines), rather than against those trying to impede and shut down democracy.\u00a0 Local responses\u00a0 What can we do at this point in our history, on a more local scale where we can make a difference?\u00a0 We can hold socially distanced rallies for a peaceful transition, as one is being held on Martin Luther King Jr. Day in Olympia, to make clear that the opposition to anti-democratic forces is broad-based in our communities, not just among highly politicized leftists.\u00a0 There is now state legislation against openly carrying arms at demonstrations, Senate Bill 5038. In Olympia for the past six years, it\u2019s almost exclusively right-wing demonstrators who have carried these weapons. I hope the bill covers not only the immediate area but also armed harassment or visible snipers farther away.\u00a0 There are also existing state laws\u00a0against unauthorized militias\u00a0and brandishing weapons to intimidate that have not been enforced.\u00a0 Many Pacific Northwest county sheriffs have been refusing to enforce mask laws or gun laws, and Oregon sheriffs enabled\u00a0rural militia checkpoints\u00a0to find ghost Antifa arsonists during the wildfires. Law enforcement is racist enough, and now we have to worry that they could de facto deputize armed paramilitaries. After the attempted coup, we have to build a firewall to \u201cseparate Cult and State.\u201d\u00a0 \u00a0 Instead of being intimidated by the recent crises, we can be encouraged by the longer-term trends in U.S. society. The future looks bright, it's just the present that sucks. In a temporal demographic shift, the U.S. is becoming more racially diverse, and younger voters back social equality and environmental sustainability. We\u2019ve also seen a spatial shift of progressive rallies emerging in smaller cities and towns, in red and purple counties, where the battle for American hearts and minds is really taking place.\u00a0 The Georgia election could be a tipping point both in time and space, starting a rollback of Nixon/Reagan\u2019s racist \u201cSouthern Strategy\u201d that solidified Republican rule in the South, so may portend deeper changes than the presidential election. We may look back on Trump and his coup as the last gasp of the dinosaurs, trying to hold back inevitable change, and the upsurge of social movements as the comet that wiped them out.\u00a0 In the longer term, white people can take responsibility to support counterrecruitment of middle and high school students who may be drawn to far-right messages, or work with fellow soldiers and veterans, or in our work and social circles. By writing off large swaths of the country as cultural-political wastelands, we\u2019re leaving a vacuum that the far-right has filled.\u00a0 Community organizers have done some amazing work in rolling back far-right harassment and violence in red and purple counties, such as the\u00a0Rural Organizing Project\u00a0in Oregon,\u00a0Love Lives Here\u00a0and\u00a0Not In Our Town\u00a0in Montana, the\u00a0Hate Free Schools Coalition\u00a0in North Carolina, and many more. \u00a0Research groups such as the\u00a0Institute for Research and Education on Human Rights\u00a0in Seattle,\u00a0Political Research Associates, \u00a0Three Way Fight\u00a0and\u00a0Southern Poverty Law Center\u00a0have provided valuable information on the far-right.\u00a0 \u00a0 Widening our circles\u00a0 No matter what our personal opinions, we spend too much time talking with people we feel are right for the right reasons, and railing against people who are wrong for the wrong reasons. We need to enlarge our discussions, that\u2019s where new connections can be made and crises can be reframed.\u00a0\u00a0 There are lots of people who are wrong for the right reasons. Their hearts in the right place but they\u2019ve been attracted to false propaganda. As I stated in my book, \"Unlikely Alliances: Native Nations and White Communities Join to Defend Rural Lands,\" some white fishers who scapegoated Native treaty fishers for declining fish stocks, started working with the tribes to protect the fish from habitat destruction.\u00a0 If you have friends really concerned about sex trafficking of kids, but are taken in by false conspiracy QAnon theories about Hollywood Satanists drinking kids\u2019 blood, tell them about the real factual crisis of trafficking, such as the Murdered and Missing Indigenous Women and Girls.\u00a0\u00a0 There are also people who are right for the wrong reasons, such as opposing billionaires like \u00a0George Soros or Bill Gates, but because they supposedly want to overwhelm the West with immigrants or track us through vaccines.\u00a0 We can redirect some of these people toward the plenty of other reasons to dislike billionaires.\u00a0 Similarly, some people dislike Big Tech for its censorship, but only objected when Trump\u2019s Twitter was shut down. There are plenty of problems we can identify with Big Tech shaping opinion, in fact facebook abetted the rise of the far right. When our friends or family have a poor information diet, we can start to fill that vacuum with more factual, nutritious information, but more importantly by connecting to their emotions of anger and hope. Like in facing the climate crisis and the pandemic, confronting the threat of fascism cannot be based on passively waiting for government action from above, or the results of the next election, but starting to form a patchwork of models from below, at the local, grassroots level. Learning the inconvenient truths about fascism, like learning about the climate and health crises, could lead us to actually shift our beliefs and lives, in order for democracy to survive, recover, and grow.

                "title": "The Governance of China in a Changing World \u2013 A Review of Xi Jinping: The Governance of China III",
                "text": "Exactly one year ago Chinese President Xi Jinping delivered a speech in which he reflected on the exercise of power in the most populated country with the world\u2019s oldest continuous culture on January 13, 2020. The speech is the last one of the 92 articles included in his work The Governance of China III. This third volume assembles President Xi\u2019s speeches and texts delivered between October 18, 2017 and January 13, 2020 preceding the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the ideas in the book are clearly still valid today. \n\n\n\nThe Tiananmen Square is a landmark of political and cultural importance in Beijing, China.\u00a0\n\n\n\nSeveral insights attract readers\u2019 attention from the start. At the national level, Xi\u2019s goal of realizing rejuvenation of the Chinese nation manifests itself in multiple ways, with the most striking one being the unleashing of the country\u2019s vitality leading to the greatest economic growth in humankind\u2019s history. During 2020, such vitality had not been subdued by the pandemic, but on the contrary, remained strong. Despite the still uncertain global economic outlook, the World Bank projected that China\u2019s GDP growth will accelerate to 7.9 percent in 2021. At the same time, the pandemic also reinforces Xi\u2019s assessment that the current world is facing changes unseen in a century. \n\n\n\nIn contrast with volatile international situations and the alarming domestic division in the United States, the world largest economy, also the representative of Western democracy, China\u2019s incredible feats unfolding before our eyes make people believe that it will not be long before the country can realize the Chinese Dream of national rejuvenation. Indeed, anyone who dispassionately observes the crisis in the U.S. Capitol, where hordes of vandals stormed the building encouraged by the sitting American president himself, against the backdrop of tens of millions of citizens who do not trust the mechanisms of their own democracy, knows that we are witnessing a major change with remarkable potential echo in international politics. U.S. democracy, seen as a model in the West for two centuries, is cracking dramatically due to internal causes. \n\n\n\nIn the West, it\u2019s usually the case that politicians trumpet short-term goals to win over voters, while statesmen who think deeply or adopt a long-term approach are hardly recognized and seem to belong to the past. In such a context, it is completely novel to read a 650-page corpus containing the ideas of a country\u2019s leader ruling a fifth of the world\u2019s population and contributing to multilateralism and to global interdependence like no other. In style and content, Xi\u2019s analysis is based on Marxism with Chinese characteristics, with clear language sometimes incorporating references to the country\u2019s philosophical wisdom dating back 5,000 years, making it a unique flowing narrative. Also, in times that call for more international cooperation, it is worth noting that The Governance of China III can help readers of different continents to understand Xi\u2019s motivations and the country\u2019s achievements directly, without intermediaries. \n\n\n\nHow does a leader of a country responsible for a third of the world\u2019s economic growth assess the course of the local and global economy? How does he evaluate the public policy mechanisms of the government that has managed to lift nearly 800 million people out of poverty in the last forty years? Which steps has China taken to achieve the status of a moderately prosperous society? What are the institutional merits of the country which can explain its successful fight against the novel coronavirus while most of the world is overwhelmed by the virus? What are the guiding principle and goals of the Belt and Road Initiative? What is the exact meaning of a community with a shared future for mankind? The answers to these and other fundamental questions are found in the book. \n\n\n\nRegarding foreign policy, the reader will find explanatory references to a series of international initiatives, with China as an important player, that include APEC, BRICS, the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, the China-Africa Cooperation Forum, the G20, and the Belt and Road Initiative. \n\n\n\nCenturies ago, some remarkable Western intellectuals studied China in search of wisdom about governance and a model of government. Over time we have learned that each country has its unique characteristics, and that, above all, it is not wise for a country to try to copy a foreign model without considering its own circumstances. China has been following its own path. Under the leadership of Xi Jinping, the country has been adjusting itself to the changing situations. \n\n\n\nToday, the world is changing at an unprecedented rate. When the world\u2019s most powerful country appears structurally divided and confused, the world needs to be reoriented. When CNN\u2019s White House correspondent reported that the incumbent U.S. president, \u201cis leaving America in a whirlwind of violence, disease, and death and more internally alienated than it has been in 150 years,\u201d as global citizens we must wake up and readjust our perspective. The ancient Greek and Chinese classics already warned us that time is flowing, and thus we need resilience. This means that inspired by great thinkers, we must remain curious and seek the truth from facts, which is also a fine tradition of the Communist Party of China (CPC), the world\u2019s largest political party. \n\n\n\nFollowing the structural guidelines outlined in Xi Jinping: The Governance of China III, the CPC, concluded the fifth plenary session of its 19th Central Committee in October. To boost its economic development, China decided to further accentuate innovation, the real economy, a strong domestic market, the invigoration of rural areas, and green and sustainable development. And the emphasis is reflected in the CPC Central Committee\u2019s proposals for the 14th Five-Year Plan for National Economic and Social Development (2021-2025) and the Long-Range Objectives Through the Year 2035. Is there anything in these wide-ranging plans (which includes a vision of China and the world by 2049), that can also inspire us within the framework of a community with a shared future? Certainly, the answer is positive, and the answer is also an invitation to read the book so as to get an insight about the CPC\u2019s guiding ideas and decision-making processes in governing the country. \n\n\n\nWhen the ancient country translates its governance vision into a modernization drive, which will meet its goal in a time span much shorter than Western modernization had taken in the 20th century, it is time to reflect on the importance of the governance of China and on the importance of continuous and deeper interaction. Recent examples, such as the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP), signed among Asia Pacific countries including China, and the EU-China investment agreement, both sealed in the last two months, demonstrate that the notion of a community with a shared future for mankind proposed by Xi is a feasible path. \n\n\n\nPractical synergies mean that China and the rest of the world have more chance of pursuing progress if they work together, than if each country pursued development decoupled from other countries. This is the central message to the world of the highly recommended Xi Jinping: The Governance of China III at the beginning of a new year. \n\n\n\n___________ \n\n\n\nAUGUSTO SOTO is director of Dialogue with China Project and representative in Spain of China Today.",

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              Passports to be required for entrance to large number of public venues, even though there's no proof yet that vaccine confers immunity.                                                        Despite repeated assurances that the coronavirus vaccine will not be  made compulsory, the government is gradually extending the limits of its  \"positive incentives\" system for promoting vaccination to the general  public, and yesterday disclosed further ways in which those people who  comply with official advice will benefit.                                                         \"To achieve herd immunity in the State of Israel, we're talking about  70 percent [of the population] vaccinated. The green passport is a  means that we want to use it to manage daily life as the number of people  who have recovered from the virus increases,\" Professor Nachman Ash, the  government's coronavirus project manager told the Knesset's  Constitution, Law, and Justice Committee.                                                         Ministry officials later expanded further on what they had in mind,  telling MKs that the passport would likely be required for entrance to  cultural and sports events, museums, hotels, restaurants and cafes,  malls, gyms, and swimming pools. However, it would not be required for  entrance to schools, workplaces, synagogues, street stores; or for using  public transportation.                                                         Although  officials stated that the purpose of the passports was to encourage  vaccination and to enable the government to reopen the economy, they  emphasized that \"restrictions on the size of public gatherings and on  occupancy of public spaces will continue \u2013 these will be dependent on  the rate of infection in the general population.\"                                                         According to Ash, certain venues will also be accessible to those who  can provide proof that they are not carrying the coronavirus, even if  they are not vaccinated. \"Whoever was vaccinated or has recovered [and  can provide an immunity certificate] will be able to enter places \u2026  whoever wasn't, can do a test instead,\" he said.                                                         However, vaccination will confer enhanced benefits such as exemption from quarantine requirements following travel abroad. The Health  Ministry stated that it plans to issue a special document for those who  have received both vaccine shots, valid for six months following the  second dose. Those who merely test negative for the virus would be able  to obtain a temporary passport valid for just 72 hours.                                                         According to the deputy director-general of the Health Ministry,  Prof. Itamar Grotto, the main factor delaying the plan to issue  passports were the necessity of ensuring that faked documents did not  begin to circulate. Green passports are likely to be in the form of a  the smartphone application, or possibly voice recognition, but there will  also, be an option to print out a document for the holder.                                                         Other countries have also begun to discuss the concept of passports  that will discriminate between those who have been vaccinated and  others, albeit more tentatively.                                                         \"We  could follow Israel's example by giving each person who gets the vaccine a green passport,\" said an MP in the French Parliament last month, quoted by Connexion France. \"This would allow them to go into cultural spaces, restaurants\u2026 basically, to resume a normal life.\"                                                         In the United Kingdom, however, senior government minister Michael  Gove insisted that, \"That's not the plan,\" when asked about issuing a  special passport. \"Let's not get ahead of ourselves,\" he said, promising  that \"of course\u2026 [businesses would] have the capacity to make decisions  about who they will admit and why.\"                                                         All the same, when questioned on the government's intentions, junior  health minister Nadhim Zahawi told the BBC that, \"We are looking at the  technology.\"                                                         He added that, \"I think you'll probably find that \u2026 the pressure will  come from both ways, from service providers who'll say, 'Look,  demonstrate to us that you have been vaccinated.'\"                                                         Nonetheless, the vaccine for coronavirus differs from others for  various other diseases such as polio, where some countries already  require proof of immunization, as there is as yet no evidence that it  prevents transmission of the disease \u2013 data provided by the  pharmaceutical companies who have rolled out vaccines so far only refer  to the suppression of symptoms.                                                         Here is an update to this story:                                                         The government said planning to roll out vaccine 'green passport' in lockdown exit                                                         The reported plan would see Israel first reopen kindergartens, some school grades, and stores, then use the document to control access to hotels, culture, and sports venues                                                         By TOI STAFF                                                         The government may roll out the proposed \"green passport\" for those vaccinated against COVID-19 when it begins easing lockdown measures, Israeli television reported Tuesday, publishing some details from the planned steps for exiting the current closure.                                                         The lockdown is set to end on January 21, but officials have warned it may be extended as Israel has in recent days recorded new records in daily confirmed infections, active cases and serious patients.                                                         According to Channel 12 news, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu held talks Tuesday to discuss how to gradually lift the lockdown and on introducing the green passport.                                                         The document, which is being spearheaded by the Health Ministry, will be granted to Israelis who have received a vaccine or recovered from the virus, allowing them to attend large gatherings and cultural venues. The ministry has said those who test negative for COVID-19 can receive a temporary green passport for 72 hours.                                                         The TV report said an initial plan for rolling back the lockdown will see kindergartens, some elementary school classes and grades 11-12 return to school in the first stage, along with some stores and service industries involving close contact if there is only one worker serving one customer at a time.                                                                                                                    No further details were given on the plan.                                                         After a record 9,665 new infections were confirmed Monday and with the death toll surging, a top Health Ministry official said planning for lifting restrictions was made \"more complex\" by the national vaccination drive, a factor not present during the previous lockdowns.                                                         \"Therefore, one of the things we'll look at is the number of sick patients. As soon as we see a decrease, we'll know it's possible to open,\" Sharon Alroy-Preis, the acting head of the ministry's public health services division, said during a briefing.                                                         She said there was no way to bring down infections without stringent restrictions.                                                                                                                    \"We need to maintain the lockdown and the guidelines to bring down the morbidity rate. We'll keep track of the infection figures and make recommendations accordingly. I believe that we cannot leave the lockdown in ten days,\" she said.                                                         Alroy-Preis said that 73% of Israelis who are over the age of 60 or who have other high-risk factors have already been vaccinated with at least one shot, but noted that inoculations were slower in the Arab and ultra-Orthodox communities.                                                         The latest number given by officials for total vaccinations was 1,910,330 \u2014 about 20% of the population \u2014 although Netanyahu on Tuesday held a ceremonial event celebrating the two-millionth person to be vaccinated.                                                         Updated figures published Tuesday evening by the Health Ministry said 9,665 new cases had been confirmed Monday, an all-time record. However, the rate of positive tests, 7.6%, was roughly half of the record reached in September. The number of daily tests has since grown dramatically and stood at 127,075 on Monday.                                                         Initial figures for Tuesday showed a similar positivity rate of 7.3% \u2014 5,399 cases out of 73,874 tests conducted by 6 p.m.                                                         The number of total cases since the pandemic began, which passed half a million earlier in the day, reached 508,604, including 75,408 active cases \u2014 a new all-time record. Of them, 1,072 people were in serious condition, including 336 listed as being in critical condition and 269 on ventilators.                                                         The death toll surged to 3,756 \u2014 an increase of more than 50 since the morning.                                                         The Health Ministry hopes to have vaccinated 5.2 million citizens against the coronavirus by the end of March.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Sheldon Adelson laid to rest in Jerusalem                                                        Businessman, philanthropist, and  Republican megadonor Sheldon Adelson brought to Mount of Olives  cemetery in Jerusalem to be laid to rest.                                                        The funeral service for American Jewish businessman and philanthropist  Sheldon Adelson was held in Jerusalem Friday afternoon, at a private  service on the Mount of Olives.                                                         The service is closed to the media, with only family present.                                                         Adelson's remains arrived in Israel Thursday evening. His coffin was flown on his private plane from Los Angeles.                                                         Friends and family came to the airport to greet Adelson's remains, including Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu.                                                         Adelson, 87, passed away on Tuesday from complications related to treatment for non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma.                                                         Adelson, the son of poor Jewish immigrants to the US, began his  business career at the age of 12 when he borrowed $200 from his uncle to  purchase a license to sell newspapers in Boston. He went on to start 50  businesses over the course of his career.                                                         Adelson was a prolific philanthropist and political donor. The  Adelson Family Foundation has donated $140 million to Birthright Israel  since 2007. He and his wife Miriam were also among the biggest donors to  US President Donald Trump's election campaign in 2016.                                                         In 2007, Adelson launched the Yisrael Hayom newspaper, a free Hebrew Israeli daily which quickly rose to become Israel's most-read newspaper.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               Blood Pressure Often Differs Widely Between Two Arms: Study                                                                                                                                                          Blood pressure readings between the two arms can be different, and that disparity can sometimes be a warning sign of heart trouble down the road.                                                                                                    By: Amy Norton                                                   Blood pressure readings between the two arms can be different, and  that disparity can sometimes be a warning sign of heart trouble down the  road.                                                   That's the finding of an analysis of 24 past studies: When people  have at least a 5-point difference in blood pressure between the two  arms, their risk of heart attack, stroke or premature death inches up.  And the greater the difference, the more those risks climb.                                                                                                                                                                                                           Experts said the findings give more support to something that's been  advocated, but not commonly done by doctors and nurses: Checking  patients' blood pressure in both arms.                                                   \"Unfortunately, blood pressure is not routinely measured in both  arms,\" said Dr. Jeffrey Berger, a cardiologist who was not involved in  the study. \"But I think it should be.\"                                                   Berger directs the Center for the Prevention of Cardiovascular  Disease at NYU Langone Health in New York City. He said he always checks  blood pressure in both arms, and thinks it should be a matter of  routine in all patients.                                                   \"It's such a simple thing to do,\" Berger said.                                                   It's not that the blood pressure difference, itself, is the problem.  But a discrepancy between arms might be a sign of early atherosclerosis  that is developing asymmetrically, Berger explained.                                                   Atherosclerosis refers to a hardening and narrowing in the arteries that, eventually, could lead to heart disease or stroke.                                                   Measuring blood pressure in both arms gives doctors \"a simple way of  noticing possible arterial stiffening,\" said Dr. Christopher Clark, lead  researcher on the new analysis.                                                   There's no way to \"fix\" between-arm discrepancies, but that's not the  point, said Clark, a clinical senior lecturer at the University of  Exeter Medical School in the United Kingdom.                                                   Instead, he explained, doctors can consider between-arm differences one \"marker\" of a patient's heart disease risk.                                                   And then what? Berger said it depends on a patient's overall health.  Eating more healthfully and getting regular exercise is always wise, he  said, but some people might need medication, like a statin, to ward off  cardiovascular trouble.                                                   The findings, published online Dec. 21 in the journal Hypertension,  are based on 24 studies from around the world, involving almost 54,000  adults in all. Over 10 years, 11% had a fatal or non-fatal heart attack  or stroke.                                                   It's normal, Clark said, to have a few points of variation in blood  pressure between the two arms \u2014 due to anatomy and the fact that one  hand is typically dominant.                                                   \"Our interest was to identify when that difference is large enough to  be regarded as signifying more than this,\" Clark said. \"When is the  difference large enough to suggest a change in the arteries that might  signify additional risk of strokes or heart attacks?\"                                                   Overall, his team found, people's risks started to climb when the two  arms showed at least a 5-point difference in systolic blood pressure  (the \"top\" number in a blood pressure reading).                                                   For each 1-point increase, the risk of dying from heart disease  causes in the next 10 years rose by 1% to 2%. Meanwhile, the odds of  suffering a first-time heart problem or stroke also crept up.                                                   Those increases were small, but the researchers said that a 10-point  difference in systolic pressure between arms should be considered the  \"upper limit of normal.\"                                                   Between-arm differences are more common in people with high blood  pressure, Clark said, but people with normal readings can have them,  too.                                                   The phenomenon matters more for someone with high blood pressure or  other risk factors, like diabetes and high cholesterol, he added.                                                   Berger said that it's not clear why so few health care providers measure blood pressure in both arms.                                                   \"This is not a new finding,\" he said of the current study. \"It's been shown many times.\"                                                   For now, Berger suggested patients ask questions the next time they  have a blood pressure check: If it's not being done in both arms, why  not?                                                   As for home blood pressure monitoring, he said, if people repeatedly  detect a significant difference between the arms, they should tell their  doctor.                                                   Clark was also in favor of doctors checking both arms, at least once \u2014  in part to get a more accurate gauge of patients' blood pressure. If  one arm has a higher reading, he said, then future measurements should  be taken on that arm.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         Tyrannical governments use lockdowns to promote evil, not health                                                  Israeli small business owners  and unemployed get stipends to keep their heads above water. We should  pity the rest of the world.                                                    The Covid pandemic will shape the outlook for years to come. In good ways and bad. At the beginning of the lockdowns, I often warned that shenanigans would follow (also see AmericanThinker: Beware of tyranny more than covid 19. Now that some countries have entered a third round, the entirety of the experiment is open to the naked eye. The sight is not so pretty.                                                   Freedom House, a think-tank in Washington, counts 80 countries under lockdown orders where democracy and human rights took a turn for the worse. The list covers dictatorships grown nastier and democracies sunk into quasi police states. Governments to the right and left have taken advantage of a general state of alarm. A journalist named H.L. Mencken wrote, long before the pandemic, \"The whole aim of practical politics is to keep the populace alarmed by an endless series of hobgoblins, most of them imaginary.\"                                                   When people have a pandemic to alarm them they will clamour to be led to safety. Some put their faith in rocky health experts, others in office holders arrogant as satraps. Both, with the help of big media, find it easy to spread panic and dread. Freedom House counted 91 countries using Covid as an excuse to harass commentary that displeases the powerful. Groupthink is fiercely enforced. Lockdown is the one correct position, and everyone must be for it.                                                   There are pandemic elections to go with. Ruling parties suspend them because of being 'afraid' of the super-spreader. In Hong Kong pro-democracy candidates were expected to do well in the September election. Citing the risk of Covid, pro-China candidates put the election back a year.                                                   Russian President Putin used the panic cunningly. First he shifted responsibility for strict lockdowns to regional governors. He then relaxed them and took the credit. A pseudo-referendum to allow Putin to stay in office until 2036 was another bright scheme. Citing public health, he extended voting to a week, and \u2013 note this well, US Democrats \u2013 he allowed voting at home, in courtyards, in playgrounds and on tree stumps. The ballot was impossible to verify and Putin declared a resounding victory \u2013 so impossible that Parliament voted to make the trial electoral system permanent.                                                   Will all this panic and string-pulling recede with the pandemic? Not if it lasts long enough to get rulers hooked on it. Here we should identify two sorts of tyranny. One is well-meant, the other is not. C S Lewis the classics scholar, author and theologian, wrote in 'God in the Dock' about tyranny of the well-meaning sort. \"A tyranny sincerely exercised for the good of its victims may be the most oppressive. It would be better to live under robber barons than under omnipotent moral busybodies. Those who torment us for our own good will torment us without end, for they do so with the approval of their own conscience.\"                                                   Clerics were among the 'moral busybodies'. Once upon a time they used unspeakable cruelty to protect the monopoly of Catholicism and the Pope in Rome. Protestants bore the brunt, to teach by example, to spare Catholics the torments of purgatory. Evil means were deployed to prevent evil.                                                   CS Lewis was a theologian, not a social scientist, and had nothing to say about the other tyranny: evil for evil sake. The masses do not suffer for their own good, or for the approval of the persecutor's conscience. They suffer in the cause of some cruel and callous scheme. The murderous maniacs of the 1900s fall in this bracket: Stalin, Hitler, Mao and Pol Pot offered neither penance nor reward, earthly or eternal. Their subjects lived through hell and died, often willingly, for some crackpot utopia.                                                   Some lords of lockdown are kith and kin of those terrible twins. Some order lockdown for our own good, to save us from Covid. Others order lockdown to exercise power, for the sheer thrill of it. Liberty gets trampled, lives and livelihoods crushed.                                                   The well-meaning tyrants come in different guises and degrees of how well they mean. The political class and attendant health advisors run the show. Who else would \u2013 God above? Who needs to? Pandemics in the 1950's and 60's equalled the killing power of Covid, but countries let pandemics play themselves out, in the way they tend to do. No government abolished freedom and demolished a country. Not so Britain's Boris Johnson who was among the first leaders to do both, starting with the slogan: \"Stay home. Protect the NHS. Save lives.\" The first edict worked all too well: town centers and public places became haunts for ghosts. The plea to protect the health system proved superfluous: as it mostly did elsewhere, the system quickly created over-capacity. No. The wrecking ball was the command, 'Stay home'. It, the lockdown, was the deadliest in all Europe.  If it saved anyone from Covid death, staying home definitely took lives and livelihoods wholesale and willy-nilly. It made the wrecked survivors, the workless, a burden to themselves and the country.                                                   Then you get the American state of Florida. Did it pay a price for giving tyranny a wider berth than New York or California, which puts residents through hell, for their own damn good! Ask fleeing New Yorkers and Californians: why flee to Florida?                                                   To spit on lockdowns, curves refuse to flatten, infection rates head where they like, and one in a few hundred of the infected continue dying with Covid. None of it stops lords of lockdown egging on their countrymen to greater vigilance, even as lockdown tallies spike taller than Covid tallies. How we hug a faulty lifejacket while we sink! The authors of The Price of Panic present graphs of infection rates from which it cannot be seen when lockdowns began and when they ended. The infection rate, we never learn, is no more dependent on lockdown than crime is dependent on jail time.                                                   There is a whole political class aware of that, and so rides on lockdown to do evil. The quest for safety, it grasps, is all-consuming, and surrenders power into the laps of those who crave it. Also the patronage at their disposal is a money-printer. Fortunes are made from milking the market for items and services that hapless subjects have to have to feel safe. Panic is obscenely profitable. Tumble people into a contagion and they'll pay through the teeth to get their hands on test kits or face shields, or even more on the long awaited vaccine.                                                   It seems too easy for adherents of lockdown to put their consciences to bed by going for broke. 'Don't let your guard down until it's all over. The goal (which began with preventing hospitals being overrun) has turned into stopping Covid deaths. Until the goal is reached, forget that selfish yearning for liberty. Co-operate!                                                   Is it the right goal? Many religious scholars are adamant it is. Saving a life comes before all else. Yes, the economy suffers, but if lockdown saves one infinitely precious human being, so be it.                                                   But what if we can show that multiple infinitely precious human beings have to lose their lives or livelihoods to save that one, who dies anyway? What then? And what is the limit to how many lives may be taken to save the one? Lockdowns, to believe the World Bank, have plunged hundreds of millions in Thirdl World countries back into dire poverty. The UN reckons that 490 million people in 70 countries will become poverty-stricken, reversing a decade of gains. How many lives saved will make it worth ruining 490 million others? Is there a barter rate of exchange? And what if those saved live in luxury, while those ruined on their behalf are dirt poor?                                                   Evidently Rabbi Lord Sacks, who was a scholar and moral philosopher, thought along similar lines. It came to him that the laws on saving our countrymen, far from being absolute, are just moral brain-teasers, for teasing and bathing in their divine glow. To try out the 'sanctity of precious life' principle on a global pandemic is to try out killing a cockroach with a bazooka.                                                   Still the sanctity principle has great beauty. The contemplation of it can let the mind of a great scholar soar. \"The fact,\" says the late rabbi, \"that nations, in the face of the pandemic chose life was a significant victory for the Torah's ethic of the sanctity of life.\"                                                   It is what it is. Many of those nations, in their heart of hearts, chose life as a token. Death and ruination they chose as inescapable facts. Choosing both, those nations set a brain-twister to beat them all. How did the life they chose to save connect to the 490 million lives they chose to let penury and death take care of?                                                   Rabbi Lord Sacks had a practical brain to go with his deeply insightful one. He saw through the tinsel curtain. We have no business playing the sanctity card to justify locking down all and sundry. The decrees of lockdown are not unlike cattle trading. The seller masks the defects by giving the animal a blinding good shine. Lockdown is no more scientific than is getting a good price for your decrepit cow.                                                   A rabbi can put it more eloquently, and delicately. 'The sanctity of life is a high value but not the only one. What matters are consequences. A ruler or government must act in the long-term interests of the people. That is why, though some will die as a result, governments are gradually easing the lockdown (as) the rate of infection falls, to ease distress and restore suspended liberty.\"                                                   Suspended? Would-be tyrants and desperados presiding over collapsed economies would disagree. Obstinate Covid is a gift heaven-sent. Strongmen fondle it with both hands, prolonging lockdowns under the pretext of fighting Covid. Did they look up Benjamin Franklin, I wonder? \"They who can give up essential liberty to obtain a little temporary safety deserve neither liberty nor safety.\"                                                   A society that divides off a privileged from a dispensable class is a paradise for control freaks. Gavin Newsom, Governor of California, is one. Angela Marsden's tearful video would send a thrill down Newsom the tyrant as he watches a 'deplorable' subject pouring out her pain. A brutal lockdown can destroy a whole class of business owners beyond hope for recovery, something which no financial crisis has done before. Persecutors in the Newsom mould create unemployment of fabulous proportions, not restricted to the working class, but seizing swathes of enterprising people like restaurateurs.                                                   Los Angeles, indeed, is in the grip of office bearers who could have stepped out of Sodom and Gomorrah. District Attorney George Gascon devised a method to get people to comply with Mayor Garcetti's malignant stay-home order. The DA will make city streets too dangerous for those who dare venture out their doors. Mr Gascon belongs to a breed of radical prosecutors who are eviscerating law and order so that not too many felons of colour get arrested.                                                   His office will not prosecute a range of offenses. They include driving without a licence, trespassing and resisting arrest. His double whammy is well thought out. On the one hand, the law-abiding will lock themselves indoors; on the other hand law-breakers get a free pass to make trouble on the almost police-free streets.                                                   Some good may rise out of the plague year. If it does, a new social contract must be forged.                                                   Steve Apfel is an economist and a cost accountant, but most of all a prolific author of non-fiction and fiction, published in many journals and sites. His books include: 'The Paymaster' (Fiction); Hadrian's Echo (Non-fiction); 'A bias thicker than faith' (non-fiction, for publication soon), and 'Balaam's curse' a WIP biblical novel.

Located around 200 km west of                                                    Georgia's capital city Tbilisi, this amazing landmark is famed for being                                                    notoriously difficult to reach. Reportedly, locals could only look up                                                    at the mysterious ruins at its summit for centuries. However, in 1944,                                                    mountaineer Alexander Japaridze led a group to the spot and made the                                                    first documented ascent of the pillar.

Nestled on  the edge of the Crimean Sea, it is likely the most unlikely place where  one would expect to find such a beautiful castle. Built in 1911, it has  even managed to survive an earthquake. Now, it is open to tourists and  even boasts of an Italian restaurant.

It is a temple built into the side of a cliff near  Mount Heng in Shanxi Province, China, which was actually constructed  without any wooden pillars that now seem to support it. It has 40 rooms  that re linked by a maze of passageways. It was originally constructed  by drilling holes into the cliff that hold up the temples.

Most of the streets and houses are built of the dark,  volcanic rock. The town once had a normal shape, which got stretched out  over a kilometre-long basalt formation due to some incredible force.  The main street of this spot winds across the entire town that are  pressed between houses on both sides, thereby pulling it to remain on  the cliff face.

To reach  the chapel, one has to climb 268 steps that have been carved into the  rock. It is a fascinating little pilgrimage chapel that is nestled on  top of a rocky needle formation that gives you a sense that you are  dramatically climbing high into the sky.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Passports to be required for entrance to large number of public venues, even though there's no proof yet that vaccine confers immunity.                                                        Despite repeated assurances that the coronavirus vaccine will not be  made compulsory, the government is gradually extending the limits of its  \"positive incentives\" system for promoting vaccination to the general  public, and yesterday disclosed further ways in which those people who  comply with official advice will benefit.                                                         \"To achieve herd immunity in the State of Israel, we're talking about  70 percent [of the population] vaccinated. The green passport is a  means that we want to use it to manage daily life as the number of people  who have recovered from the virus increases,\" Professor Nachman Ash, the  government's coronavirus project manager told the Knesset's  Constitution, Law, and Justice Committee.                                                         Ministry officials later expanded further on what they had in mind,  telling MKs that the passport would likely be required for entrance to  cultural and sports events, museums, hotels, restaurants and cafes,  malls, gyms, and swimming pools. However, it would not be required for  entrance to schools, workplaces, synagogues, street stores; or for using  public transportation.                                                         Although  officials stated that the purpose of the passports was to encourage  vaccination and to enable the government to reopen the economy, they  emphasized that \"restrictions on the size of public gatherings and on  occupancy of public spaces will continue \u2013 these will be dependent on  the rate of infection in the general population.\"                                                         According to Ash, certain venues will also be accessible to those who  can provide proof that they are not carrying the coronavirus, even if  they are not vaccinated. \"Whoever was vaccinated or has recovered [and  can provide an immunity certificate] will be able to enter places \u2026  whoever wasn't, can do a test instead,\" he said.                                                         However, vaccination will confer enhanced benefits such as exemption from quarantine requirements following travel abroad. The Health  Ministry stated that it plans to issue a special document for those who  have received both vaccine shots, valid for six months following the  second dose. Those who merely test negative for the virus would be able  to obtain a temporary passport valid for just 72 hours.                                                         According to the deputy director-general of the Health Ministry,  Prof. Itamar Grotto, the main factor delaying the plan to issue  passports were the necessity of ensuring that faked documents did not  begin to circulate. Green passports are likely to be in the form of a  the smartphone application, or possibly voice recognition, but there will  also, be an option to print out a document for the holder.                                                         Other countries have also begun to discuss the concept of passports  that will discriminate between those who have been vaccinated and  others, albeit more tentatively.                                                         \"We  could follow Israel's example by giving each person who gets the vaccine a green passport,\" said an MP in the French Parliament last month, quoted by Connexion France. \"This would allow them to go into cultural spaces, restaurants\u2026 basically, to resume a normal life.\"                                                         In the United Kingdom, however, senior government minister Michael  Gove insisted that, \"That's not the plan,\" when asked about issuing a  special passport. \"Let's not get ahead of ourselves,\" he said, promising  that \"of course\u2026 [businesses would] have the capacity to make decisions  about who they will admit and why.\"                                                         All the same, when questioned on the government's intentions, junior  health minister Nadhim Zahawi told the BBC that, \"We are looking at the  technology.\"                                                         He added that, \"I think you'll probably find that \u2026 the pressure will  come from both ways, from service providers who'll say, 'Look,  demonstrate to us that you have been vaccinated.'\"                                                         Nonetheless, the vaccine for coronavirus differs from others for  various other diseases such as polio, where some countries already  require proof of immunization, as there is as yet no evidence that it  prevents transmission of the disease \u2013 data provided by the  pharmaceutical companies who have rolled out vaccines so far only refer  to the suppression of symptoms.                                                         Here is an update to this story:                                                         The government said planning to roll out vaccine 'green passport' in lockdown exit                                                         The reported plan would see Israel first reopen kindergartens, some school grades, and stores, then use the document to control access to hotels, culture, and sports venues                                                         By TOI STAFF                                                         The government may roll out the proposed \"green passport\" for those vaccinated against COVID-19 when it begins easing lockdown measures, Israeli television reported Tuesday, publishing some details from the planned steps for exiting the current closure.                                                         The lockdown is set to end on January 21, but officials have warned it may be extended as Israel has in recent days recorded new records in daily confirmed infections, active cases and serious patients.                                                         According to Channel 12 news, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu held talks Tuesday to discuss how to gradually lift the lockdown and on introducing the green passport.                                                         The document, which is being spearheaded by the Health Ministry, will be granted to Israelis who have received a vaccine or recovered from the virus, allowing them to attend large gatherings and cultural venues. The ministry has said those who test negative for COVID-19 can receive a temporary green passport for 72 hours.                                                         The TV report said an initial plan for rolling back the lockdown will see kindergartens, some elementary school classes and grades 11-12 return to school in the first stage, along with some stores and service industries involving close contact if there is only one worker serving one customer at a time.                                                                                                                    No further details were given on the plan.                                                         After a record 9,665 new infections were confirmed Monday and with the death toll surging, a top Health Ministry official said planning for lifting restrictions was made \"more complex\" by the national vaccination drive, a factor not present during the previous lockdowns.                                                         \"Therefore, one of the things we'll look at is the number of sick patients. As soon as we see a decrease, we'll know it's possible to open,\" Sharon Alroy-Preis, the acting head of the ministry's public health services division, said during a briefing.                                                         She said there was no way to bring down infections without stringent restrictions.                                                                                                                    \"We need to maintain the lockdown and the guidelines to bring down the morbidity rate. We'll keep track of the infection figures and make recommendations accordingly. I believe that we cannot leave the lockdown in ten days,\" she said.                                                         Alroy-Preis said that 73% of Israelis who are over the age of 60 or who have other high-risk factors have already been vaccinated with at least one shot, but noted that inoculations were slower in the Arab and ultra-Orthodox communities.                                                         The latest number given by officials for total vaccinations was 1,910,330 \u2014 about 20% of the population \u2014 although Netanyahu on Tuesday held a ceremonial event celebrating the two-millionth person to be vaccinated.                                                         Updated figures published Tuesday evening by the Health Ministry said 9,665 new cases had been confirmed Monday, an all-time record. However, the rate of positive tests, 7.6%, was roughly half of the record reached in September. The number of daily tests has since grown dramatically and stood at 127,075 on Monday.                                                         Initial figures for Tuesday showed a similar positivity rate of 7.3% \u2014 5,399 cases out of 73,874 tests conducted by 6 p.m.                                                         The number of total cases since the pandemic began, which passed half a million earlier in the day, reached 508,604, including 75,408 active cases \u2014 a new all-time record. Of them, 1,072 people were in serious condition, including 336 listed as being in critical condition and 269 on ventilators.                                                         The death toll surged to 3,756 \u2014 an increase of more than 50 since the morning.                                                         The Health Ministry hopes to have vaccinated 5.2 million citizens against the coronavirus by the end of March.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Sheldon Adelson laid to rest in Jerusalem                                                        Businessman, philanthropist, and  Republican megadonor Sheldon Adelson brought to Mount of Olives  cemetery in Jerusalem to be laid to rest.                                                        The funeral service for American Jewish businessman and philanthropist  Sheldon Adelson was held in Jerusalem Friday afternoon, at a private  service on the Mount of Olives.                                                         The service is closed to the media, with only family present.                                                         Adelson's remains arrived in Israel Thursday evening. His coffin was flown on his private plane from Los Angeles.                                                         Friends and family came to the airport to greet Adelson's remains, including Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu.                                                         Adelson, 87, passed away on Tuesday from complications related to treatment for non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma.                                                         Adelson, the son of poor Jewish immigrants to the US, began his  business career at the age of 12 when he borrowed $200 from his uncle to  purchase a license to sell newspapers in Boston. He went on to start 50  businesses over the course of his career.                                                         Adelson was a prolific philanthropist and political donor. The  Adelson Family Foundation has donated $140 million to Birthright Israel  since 2007. He and his wife Miriam were also among the biggest donors to  US President Donald Trump's election campaign in 2016.                                                         In 2007, Adelson launched the Yisrael Hayom newspaper, a free Hebrew Israeli daily which quickly rose to become Israel's most-read newspaper.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               Blood Pressure Often Differs Widely Between Two Arms: Study                                                                                                                                                          Blood pressure readings between the two arms can be different, and that disparity can sometimes be a warning sign of heart trouble down the road.                                                                                                    By: Amy Norton                                                   Blood pressure readings between the two arms can be different, and  that disparity can sometimes be a warning sign of heart trouble down the  road.                                                   That's the finding of an analysis of 24 past studies: When people  have at least a 5-point difference in blood pressure between the two  arms, their risk of heart attack, stroke or premature death inches up.  And the greater the difference, the more those risks climb.                                                                                                                                                                                                           Experts said the findings give more support to something that's been  advocated, but not commonly done by doctors and nurses: Checking  patients' blood pressure in both arms.                                                   \"Unfortunately, blood pressure is not routinely measured in both  arms,\" said Dr. Jeffrey Berger, a cardiologist who was not involved in  the study. \"But I think it should be.\"                                                   Berger directs the Center for the Prevention of Cardiovascular  Disease at NYU Langone Health in New York City. He said he always checks  blood pressure in both arms, and thinks it should be a matter of  routine in all patients.                                                   \"It's such a simple thing to do,\" Berger said.                                                   It's not that the blood pressure difference, itself, is the problem.  But a discrepancy between arms might be a sign of early atherosclerosis  that is developing asymmetrically, Berger explained.                                                   Atherosclerosis refers to a hardening and narrowing in the arteries that, eventually, could lead to heart disease or stroke.                                                   Measuring blood pressure in both arms gives doctors \"a simple way of  noticing possible arterial stiffening,\" said Dr. Christopher Clark, lead  researcher on the new analysis.                                                   There's no way to \"fix\" between-arm discrepancies, but that's not the  point, said Clark, a clinical senior lecturer at the University of  Exeter Medical School in the United Kingdom.                                                   Instead, he explained, doctors can consider between-arm differences one \"marker\" of a patient's heart disease risk.                                                   And then what? Berger said it depends on a patient's overall health.  Eating more healthfully and getting regular exercise is always wise, he  said, but some people might need medication, like a statin, to ward off  cardiovascular trouble.                                                   The findings, published online Dec. 21 in the journal Hypertension,  are based on 24 studies from around the world, involving almost 54,000  adults in all. Over 10 years, 11% had a fatal or non-fatal heart attack  or stroke.                                                   It's normal, Clark said, to have a few points of variation in blood  pressure between the two arms \u2014 due to anatomy and the fact that one  hand is typically dominant.                                                   \"Our interest was to identify when that difference is large enough to  be regarded as signifying more than this,\" Clark said. \"When is the  difference large enough to suggest a change in the arteries that might  signify additional risk of strokes or heart attacks?\"                                                   Overall, his team found, people's risks started to climb when the two  arms showed at least a 5-point difference in systolic blood pressure  (the \"top\" number in a blood pressure reading).                                                   For each 1-point increase, the risk of dying from heart disease  causes in the next 10 years rose by 1% to 2%. Meanwhile, the odds of  suffering a first-time heart problem or stroke also crept up.                                                   Those increases were small, but the researchers said that a 10-point  difference in systolic pressure between arms should be considered the  \"upper limit of normal.\"                                                   Between-arm differences are more common in people with high blood  pressure, Clark said, but people with normal readings can have them,  too.                                                   The phenomenon matters more for someone with high blood pressure or  other risk factors, like diabetes and high cholesterol, he added.                                                   Berger said that it's not clear why so few health care providers measure blood pressure in both arms.                                                   \"This is not a new finding,\" he said of the current study. \"It's been shown many times.\"                                                   For now, Berger suggested patients ask questions the next time they  have a blood pressure check: If it's not being done in both arms, why  not?                                                   As for home blood pressure monitoring, he said, if people repeatedly  detect a significant difference between the arms, they should tell their  doctor.                                                   Clark was also in favor of doctors checking both arms, at least once \u2014  in part to get a more accurate gauge of patients' blood pressure. If  one arm has a higher reading, he said, then future measurements should  be taken on that arm.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         Tyrannical governments use lockdowns to promote evil, not health                                                  Israeli small business owners  and unemployed get stipends to keep their heads above water. We should  pity the rest of the world.                                                    The Covid pandemic will shape the outlook for years to come. In good ways and bad. At the beginning of the lockdowns, I often warned that shenanigans would follow (also see AmericanThinker: Beware of tyranny more than covid 19. Now that some countries have entered a third round, the entirety of the experiment is open to the naked eye. The sight is not so pretty.                                                   Freedom House, a think-tank in Washington, counts 80 countries under lockdown orders where democracy and human rights took a turn for the worse. The list covers dictatorships grown nastier and democracies sunk into quasi police states. Governments to the right and left have taken advantage of a general state of alarm. A journalist named H.L. Mencken wrote, long before the pandemic, \"The whole aim of practical politics is to keep the populace alarmed by an endless series of hobgoblins, most of them imaginary.\"                                                   When people have a pandemic to alarm them they will clamour to be led to safety. Some put their faith in rocky health experts, others in office holders arrogant as satraps. Both, with the help of big media, find it easy to spread panic and dread. Freedom House counted 91 countries using Covid as an excuse to harass commentary that displeases the powerful. Groupthink is fiercely enforced. Lockdown is the one correct position, and everyone must be for it.                                                   There are pandemic elections to go with. Ruling parties suspend them because of being 'afraid' of the super-spreader. In Hong Kong pro-democracy candidates were expected to do well in the September election. Citing the risk of Covid, pro-China candidates put the election back a year.                                                   Russian President Putin used the panic cunningly. First he shifted responsibility for strict lockdowns to regional governors. He then relaxed them and took the credit. A pseudo-referendum to allow Putin to stay in office until 2036 was another bright scheme. Citing public health, he extended voting to a week, and \u2013 note this well, US Democrats \u2013 he allowed voting at home, in courtyards, in playgrounds and on tree stumps. The ballot was impossible to verify and Putin declared a resounding victory \u2013 so impossible that Parliament voted to make the trial electoral system permanent.                                                   Will all this panic and string-pulling recede with the pandemic? Not if it lasts long enough to get rulers hooked on it. Here we should identify two sorts of tyranny. One is well-meant, the other is not. C S Lewis the classics scholar, author and theologian, wrote in 'God in the Dock' about tyranny of the well-meaning sort. \"A tyranny sincerely exercised for the good of its victims may be the most oppressive. It would be better to live under robber barons than under omnipotent moral busybodies. Those who torment us for our own good will torment us without end, for they do so with the approval of their own conscience.\"                                                   Clerics were among the 'moral busybodies'. Once upon a time they used unspeakable cruelty to protect the monopoly of Catholicism and the Pope in Rome. Protestants bore the brunt, to teach by example, to spare Catholics the torments of purgatory. Evil means were deployed to prevent evil.                                                   CS Lewis was a theologian, not a social scientist, and had nothing to say about the other tyranny: evil for evil sake. The masses do not suffer for their own good, or for the approval of the persecutor's conscience. They suffer in the cause of some cruel and callous scheme. The murderous maniacs of the 1900s fall in this bracket: Stalin, Hitler, Mao and Pol Pot offered neither penance nor reward, earthly or eternal. Their subjects lived through hell and died, often willingly, for some crackpot utopia.                                                   Some lords of lockdown are kith and kin of those terrible twins. Some order lockdown for our own good, to save us from Covid. Others order lockdown to exercise power, for the sheer thrill of it. Liberty gets trampled, lives and livelihoods crushed.                                                   The well-meaning tyrants come in different guises and degrees of how well they mean. The political class and attendant health advisors run the show. Who else would \u2013 God above? Who needs to? Pandemics in the 1950's and 60's equalled the killing power of Covid, but countries let pandemics play themselves out, in the way they tend to do. No government abolished freedom and demolished a country. Not so Britain's Boris Johnson who was among the first leaders to do both, starting with the slogan: \"Stay home. Protect the NHS. Save lives.\" The first edict worked all too well: town centers and public places became haunts for ghosts. The plea to protect the health system proved superfluous: as it mostly did elsewhere, the system quickly created over-capacity. No. The wrecking ball was the command, 'Stay home'. It, the lockdown, was the deadliest in all Europe.  If it saved anyone from Covid death, staying home definitely took lives and livelihoods wholesale and willy-nilly. It made the wrecked survivors, the workless, a burden to themselves and the country.                                                   Then you get the American state of Florida. Did it pay a price for giving tyranny a wider berth than New York or California, which puts residents through hell, for their own damn good! Ask fleeing New Yorkers and Californians: why flee to Florida?                                                   To spit on lockdowns, curves refuse to flatten, infection rates head where they like, and one in a few hundred of the infected continue dying with Covid. None of it stops lords of lockdown egging on their countrymen to greater vigilance, even as lockdown tallies spike taller than Covid tallies. How we hug a faulty lifejacket while we sink! The authors of The Price of Panic present graphs of infection rates from which it cannot be seen when lockdowns began and when they ended. The infection rate, we never learn, is no more dependent on lockdown than crime is dependent on jail time.                                                   There is a whole political class aware of that, and so rides on lockdown to do evil. The quest for safety, it grasps, is all-consuming, and surrenders power into the laps of those who crave it. Also the patronage at their disposal is a money-printer. Fortunes are made from milking the market for items and services that hapless subjects have to have to feel safe. Panic is obscenely profitable. Tumble people into a contagion and they'll pay through the teeth to get their hands on test kits or face shields, or even more on the long awaited vaccine.                                                   It seems too easy for adherents of lockdown to put their consciences to bed by going for broke. 'Don't let your guard down until it's all over. The goal (which began with preventing hospitals being overrun) has turned into stopping Covid deaths. Until the goal is reached, forget that selfish yearning for liberty. Co-operate!                                                   Is it the right goal? Many religious scholars are adamant it is. Saving a life comes before all else. Yes, the economy suffers, but if lockdown saves one infinitely precious human being, so be it.                                                   But what if we can show that multiple infinitely precious human beings have to lose their lives or livelihoods to save that one, who dies anyway? What then? And what is the limit to how many lives may be taken to save the one? Lockdowns, to believe the World Bank, have plunged hundreds of millions in Thirdl World countries back into dire poverty. The UN reckons that 490 million people in 70 countries will become poverty-stricken, reversing a decade of gains. How many lives saved will make it worth ruining 490 million others? Is there a barter rate of exchange? And what if those saved live in luxury, while those ruined on their behalf are dirt poor?                                                   Evidently Rabbi Lord Sacks, who was a scholar and moral philosopher, thought along similar lines. It came to him that the laws on saving our countrymen, far from being absolute, are just moral brain-teasers, for teasing and bathing in their divine glow. To try out the 'sanctity of precious life' principle on a global pandemic is to try out killing a cockroach with a bazooka.                                                   Still the sanctity principle has great beauty. The contemplation of it can let the mind of a great scholar soar. \"The fact,\" says the late rabbi, \"that nations, in the face of the pandemic chose life was a significant victory for the Torah's ethic of the sanctity of life.\"                                                   It is what it is. Many of those nations, in their heart of hearts, chose life as a token. Death and ruination they chose as inescapable facts. Choosing both, those nations set a brain-twister to beat them all. How did the life they chose to save connect to the 490 million lives they chose to let penury and death take care of?                                                   Rabbi Lord Sacks had a practical brain to go with his deeply insightful one. He saw through the tinsel curtain. We have no business playing the sanctity card to justify locking down all and sundry. The decrees of lockdown are not unlike cattle trading. The seller masks the defects by giving the animal a blinding good shine. Lockdown is no more scientific than is getting a good price for your decrepit cow.                                                   A rabbi can put it more eloquently, and delicately. 'The sanctity of life is a high value but not the only one. What matters are consequences. A ruler or government must act in the long-term interests of the people. That is why, though some will die as a result, governments are gradually easing the lockdown (as) the rate of infection falls, to ease distress and restore suspended liberty.\"                                                   Suspended? Would-be tyrants and desperados presiding over collapsed economies would disagree. Obstinate Covid is a gift heaven-sent. Strongmen fondle it with both hands, prolonging lockdowns under the pretext of fighting Covid. Did they look up Benjamin Franklin, I wonder? \"They who can give up essential liberty to obtain a little temporary safety deserve neither liberty nor safety.\"                                                   A society that divides off a privileged from a dispensable class is a paradise for control freaks. Gavin Newsom, Governor of California, is one. Angela Marsden's tearful video would send a thrill down Newsom the tyrant as he watches a 'deplorable' subject pouring out her pain. A brutal lockdown can destroy a whole class of business owners beyond hope for recovery, something which no financial crisis has done before. Persecutors in the Newsom mould create unemployment of fabulous proportions, not restricted to the working class, but seizing swathes of enterprising people like restaurateurs.                                                   Los Angeles, indeed, is in the grip of office bearers who could have stepped out of Sodom and Gomorrah. District Attorney George Gascon devised a method to get people to comply with Mayor Garcetti's malignant stay-home order. The DA will make city streets too dangerous for those who dare venture out their doors. Mr Gascon belongs to a breed of radical prosecutors who are eviscerating law and order so that not too many felons of colour get arrested.                                                   His office will not prosecute a range of offenses. They include driving without a licence, trespassing and resisting arrest. His double whammy is well thought out. On the one hand, the law-abiding will lock themselves indoors; on the other hand law-breakers get a free pass to make trouble on the almost police-free streets.                                                   Some good may rise out of the plague year. If it does, a new social contract must be forged.                                                   Steve Apfel is an economist and a cost accountant, but most of all a prolific author of non-fiction and fiction, published in many journals and sites. His books include: 'The Paymaster' (Fiction); Hadrian's Echo (Non-fiction); 'A bias thicker than faith' (non-fiction, for publication soon), and 'Balaam's curse' a WIP biblical novel.

Located around 200 km west of                                                    Georgia's capital city Tbilisi, this amazing landmark is famed for being                                                    notoriously difficult to reach. Reportedly, locals could only look up                                                    at the mysterious ruins at its summit for centuries. However, in 1944,                                                    mountaineer Alexander Japaridze led a group to the spot and made the                                                    first documented ascent of the pillar.

Nestled on  the edge of the Crimean Sea, it is likely the most unlikely place where  one would expect to find such a beautiful castle. Built in 1911, it has  even managed to survive an earthquake. Now, it is open to tourists and  even boasts of an Italian restaurant.

It is a temple built into the side of a cliff near  Mount Heng in Shanxi Province, China, which was actually constructed  without any wooden pillars that now seem to support it. It has 40 rooms  that re linked by a maze of passageways. It was originally constructed  by drilling holes into the cliff that hold up the temples.

Most of the streets and houses are built of the dark,  volcanic rock. The town once had a normal shape, which got stretched out  over a kilometre-long basalt formation due to some incredible force.  The main street of this spot winds across the entire town that are  pressed between houses on both sides, thereby pulling it to remain on  the cliff face.

To reach  the chapel, one has to climb 268 steps that have been carved into the  rock. It is a fascinating little pilgrimage chapel that is nestled on  top of a rocky needle formation that gives you a sense that you are  dramatically climbing high into the sky.

                "text": "If American politics shows anything, it is that enmity, not necessity is the mother of invention. \nMany continue to feel rage over the Capitol riot on Jan. 6. I condemned the speech of\u00a0President Donald Trump\u00a0when it was still being given and opposed the challenge to the electoral votes. However, it is the future of the\u00a0Constitution, not Donald Trump, that most concerns me as the Senate is about to try to remove a president who has already left office. \nOn its face, the planned\u00a0impeachment trial\u00a0is at odds with the language of the Constitution, which expressly states that removal of a president is the primary purpose of such a trial. At the time, Trump will be neither a president nor in office. He will be a citizen and would be best served legally to forgo the trial entirely as extraconstitutional and invalid. \nThe Trump trial could prove the tale of two cases with strikingly different precedents.\u00a0The Democrats are likely to rely on the case of William Belknap rather than William Blount. For Trump, it is Blount who should be the focus of the Senate. \nBlount was a senator from Tennessee who was alarmed by a plan for Spain to cede what is now Louisiana to France. Blount was a land speculator and he sought to have Great Britain take the land instead. That led to a call for impeachment but Blount was expelled in 1797 from the Senate before he could be tried there. \nBlount went back to Tennessee and refused to appear before the Senate on the grounds that he was not subject to an impeachment trial after leaving office. He also contested the application of the impeachment provision to a legislative officer. The Senate apparently agreed and dismissed the case. \nNo other member of Congress has ever been subjected to such an impeachment trial. \nThe Belknap case is free of one of the threshold issues in the Blount case. He was not a member of Congress. However, one issue remained: he was no longer in office. Yet, as a former executive officer who had a full trial, it is the more relevant case. \nIn 1876, Belknap resigned as secretary of war after allegations were raised that he had accepted bribes and engaged in other corruption in the Indian territories. Again, there was a vote on whether the Senate could even try someone no longer in office.\u00a0Twenty-nine of 66 voting senators disagreed with even holding a trial and voted against the proposition that Belknap was \u201camenable to trial by impeachment \u2026 notwithstanding his resignation.\u201d \nNot surprisingly given that vote, Belknap was acquitted. \nThis is one time when Trump\u2019s natural inclination to be blunt would be better served to be Blount. By declining to appear, the Senate would be faced with the glaring problem of holding a trial of a citizen to decide, under Article I, Section 4, whether he \u00a0\u201cshall be removed from office\u201d \u2013 after he already left office. \nThat is not an individual but an institutional issue to be raised before any trial. Each senator must decide whether such a trial is constitutional before deciding whether an accused can be retroactively removed for a high crime and misdemeanor. \nThis is an issue reasonable people can disagree upon. Many of us have struggled with this question for years without resolution. \nThere are good-faith arguments for the constitutional authority to render judgment on such acts and to impose the future disqualification from federal office. However, under this theory, any prior president could be barred from running again by the shifting balance of Congress. Impeachments can thus be used to even long-standing scores or curry favor with some voters. \nIf the Senate proceeds to a trial despite a lack of constitutional authority, Trump can sit in Mar-a-Lago and promise to challenge any effort to disqualify him from future office. Indeed, the political miscalculation may be greater than the constitutional miscalculation. \nA trial with an empty defense table would magnify the view of many that this is an improper or, at a minimum, unnecessary exercise. Moreover, if a court were to later declare the trial unconstitutional, it would be seen as a vindication of Trump, who has long maintained that the Washington establishment has been using any means to\u00a0keep\u00a0him from office. \nIf an effort to bar his candidacy in 2024 were to fail in the courts, it could resuscitate his standing, which is currently at an all-time low.\u00a0Indeed, Blount again should be a cautionary tale. Blount remained popular back in Tennessee and spent\u00a0the rest of his life holding an elected state\u00a0office. (He died two years later during a lethal epidemic \u2013\u00a0yet another similarity to our present times.) \nAs I have previously suggested, the Senate could show institutional restraint despite the legitimate anger over Trump\u2019s Jan.\u00a06\u00a0speech before the Capitol riot. Trump\u2019s legacy already includes the inglorious distinction of two impeachments. The Senate would not compound, but undermine, that ignoble legacy with an arguably extraconstitutional act. \nThe desire to add this added condemnation to Trump would come at too high a price for the Constitution and, ultimately, the country. \nNOTE: This column also appeared on Fox.com \nBeing Blount: The First Impeachment May Offer The Best Defense For Trump published first on https://immigrationlawyerto.tumblr.com/",

The reporter is an airhead, moaning about the usual social justice virtue signalling garbage leftist idiots cry about to score social points. This hack is your usual \u201cwoke\u201d socialised idiot that splutters from the usual social justice script, despite scientific evidence proving otherwise! Glasgow Eyes Magazine don\u2019t care about facts, it\u2019s all about virtue-signalling the latest activism trend for discriminatory morons like them. \nGlasgow Eyes Magazine\u00a0doesn\u2019t report truth or have any originality at all \u2013 even the journalists are nameless, faceless cowards! One particular coward wrote articles about Adnan Ahmed\u2019s wrongful conviction / show-trial by the media and the complete miscarriage of justice he experienced (Adnan Ahmed aka Addy Agame won his appeal to overturn the wrongful conviction and sentence due to a miscarriage of justice and no actual crime to answer to in September 2020). The reporter is most likely a low-life bitter media hack, too spineless to reveal their actual identity, in pathetic fear that Red Pill groups will expose them for the seedy scumbag liars they are. Men\u2019s rights are human rights; hence why we represent the truth without succumbing to what mainstream media propaganda wants to brain-wash the masses to think. \nThe obvious problem with leftist SJW reporters and press is that they are trained to be deceitful and to sensationalise the truth by reporting inaccurate falsehoods that allow them to just about get away with telling lies because of how the misinformation is presented to simply imply something false as true. For a sneaky reporter it is a tactic used to be a creepy stalker and to attack others, whilst keeping their filthy laundry private! \nGlasgow Eyes Magazine\u00a0is an outlet set-up for coward reporters to spam their fake news (whilst pretending it\u2019s by another journalist). Scummy journalists basically just spam the same lies and inaccuracies in as many pages as possible in order to make it look like different people are talking about the same thing. This (they think) gives their stories weight as it tricks the public into believing a story because it looks like it is coming from various sources! Read Ryan Holiday\u2019s book \u201cTrust me, I\u2019m lying\u201d for a full understanding of how the media manipulate the public and destroy reputations without facing any repercussions. \nYep, we have another woke, radical social justice moron and self-proclaimed man-hater. There seems to be a direct correlation between social justice moron journalists that write garbage and that are borderline sociopaths. Que bad haircut, even worse dress-sense and below average looks and we have our latest social justice moron hate-pusher. \nThe rancid reporter doesn\u2019t have a personality or an original thought in their head. The hack is the epitome of a constructed fake person attempting to tick certain socially acceptable boxes because they are an approval chasing loser with low self-esteem. They comes across as a child desperately wanting people to like them, which in turn makes people dislike them! \nThe horrendous hack writes for scummy virtue signalling fake news rag Glasgow Eyes Magazine. Amongst Glasgow Eyes Magazine\u2019s creepy articles about man-hating and petty gossip is a sea of radical social justice moron / simp / man-hating / woke brainwashing drivel! Don\u2019t read Glasgow Eyes Magazine, it\u2019s written by bitter idiots for bitter idiots. It will only serve to ruin balanced feminine women and grounded masculine men. Glasgow Eyes Magazine is propaganda for idiots too stupid and conditioned to see through the disgusting social justice moron narrative! \nEPISODE 1-\u00a0 \u201dMainstream Media Demonisation Of Addy Agame\u201d \u2013\u00a0https://youtu.be/EUbs7CozXyI \nEPISODE 2 \u2013 \u201dThe BBC\u2019s Manipulation / Defamation Of Street Attraction\u201d \u2013\u00a0https://youtu.be/fTxL7T_Kh1w \nEPISODE 3 \u2013\u00a0 \u201dInfield Videos & False Allegations\u201d \u2013\u00a0https://youtu.be/ztKtdE33vFU \nEPISODE 4 \u2013 \u201dHistory, Society, Politics & Feminazis\u201d \u2013\u00a0https://youtu.be/BLJK1TKK5TQ \nAdnan Ahmed Acquitted And Cleared Of All False Allegation Of Acting In Threatening Or Abusive Manner (Which Is Basically Just Section 38 Breach Of The Peace)\u00a0\nGlasgow Eyes Magazine\u00a0are morons who lie to sensationalise nonsense in order to push articles via their pathetic news outlet, as well as influence unsuspecting members of the public. These idiots don\u2019t fact check at all, as is evident via their stupid hit-piece article by cowardly \u201ccourt reporter\u201d on October 22nd, 2019 regarding Addy Agame. \nTurns out Addy was right all along as all false allegations were dropped, all charges were reversed, and all wrongful convictions were overturned. Looks like scummy Glasgow Eyes Magazine got it totally wrong as usual! The fake news slime-balls even called Addy a \u201cpick-up artist.\u201d Again misinformation, as Adnan Ahmed has said on many occasions, \u201cI am not a pick-up artist, I\u2019m a dating and life coach, we help people using scientific self-help \u2013 not tricks, techniques, lines and tactics.\u201d Addy\u2019s innocence was so clear cut that despite the underhanded tactics the sleazy Scottish press employed, he was found not guilty and defeated them! \nThe spineless creep journo has a slimy bitter bratty writing manner that reflects his poncey geek personality. The sleazy reporter lacked the back-bone to make their wasted education count for anything and ended up writing for fake news rag, Glasgow Eyes Magazine. The creepy sleaze is a charmless bore, this is evident via this lame article\u00a0 about monotonous drivel. The perv loser will forever be mad at alpha males who go out and win in life! \nThe hack is most likely unattractive, overweight, has below average looks and a horrible personality. This horrible evil deviant mutant specialises in fraud journalism. Clown bums at Glasgow Eyes Magazine are professional seedy stalkers, whose job entails hounding people and desperately begging for stories for less than minimum wage. Vultures at Glasgow Eyes Magazine invent entire scenarios, casts of characters and reams of dialogue in their article about wrongfully convicted dating coach Addy Agame. \nShady creeps at Glasgow Eyes Magazine make a measly living out of corrupting an already self-indulgent / predominately white leftist media field that fakes diversity and equality. In reality they are just idiot low-IQ slime-bags that write garbage. \nDog-hacks at Glasgow Eyes Magazine are at again. The try-hard, bitter joke of a reporter wrote a crappy article in October 2019 celebrating Ahmed\u2019s wrongful conviction / imprisonment \u2013 which has now been completely reversed and quashed! The reporters track record of corny and disgusting articles that are spewed out as some sort of alarmist warped trash is evident from their past work. The sickening clown reporter doesn\u2019t care about helping people, the chubby journo only cares about pushing fake news down the throats of anyone unfortunate enough to come across their crazed ramblings. The hack gives off the air of a deranged person with \u201cwoke\u201d perspectives gathered from confused social media posts and from the sinister shallow masks of gaping insecurities and an inferiority complex. \nThe fraudster hack mentions Addy Agame in order to dirty his name further by associating him with issues that have nothing to do with him and that are not even issues in the first place. This is a disgusting abuse of journalistic responsibility, ridiculously predatory reporting and sham news \u2013 well we expect nothing less from this hack to make up a pointless story just to try to hurt someone\u2019s reputation, at least Ahmed punished slimy reporter hacks by winning his appeal to prove his innocence and expose Glasgow Eyes Magazine\u2019s pathetic poisonous tactics! Ahmed\u2019s wrongful conviction being quashed basically proves the hack wrong and Addy right \u2013 the cry baby doesn\u2019t seem to be handling it too well. \nThe sleazy scumbag stated; \u201cfound guilty of 5 offences.\u201d In reality Ahmed was wrongfully convicted by a biased jury who were influenced by an online social media campaign and horrible selective press reporting during every turn of his trial (by Scottish media scum). Even though it was clearly stated in court; \u201cthis is not a crime; being confident is not a crime, having a conversation is not a crime, witness is unreliable, asking someone out is not a crime, if you have any inclination of reasonable doubt \u2013 he\u2019s innocent, people\u2019s perspectives were skewed by how Ahmed was portrayed in a online/ media hate campaign.\u201d Ahmed was actually wrongfully convicted of section 38 breach of the peace which is equivalent to raising one\u2019s voice too loud outdoors, complete madness! Here\u2019s how the jury process works in Scotland, there is no screening for racist, feminist, prejudice or psychiatric deficiencies (unlike the USA). 15 members of the public are selected at random and simply told, \u201cdon\u2019t go on social media or media\u201d without any enforcement or checks conducted during the trial. Ahmed\u2019s jury was made up of 9 females and 6 males (some of which were programmed by the media to hate him, some pudgy beta males and some angry underweight feminists), the wrongful non-majority \u201cguilty\u201d verdict was appealed and overturned in September 2020 as no crime was actually committed! Ahmed maintained his innocence, all 18 of the fake charges were dropped due to all allegations being false! Adnan Ahmed did not receive a fair trial and is not guilty of any criminal conduct \u2013 that is the official legal outcome of this bizarre Glasgow Eyes Magazine witch-hunt! Addy won; the media, the trolls and his false accusers were defeated by him! \nThe jury and accusers are asked to take an \u201coath to God\u201d to ensure an unbiased testimony, without individuals even being screened to see if they even believe in God (in an age of rampant atheist beliefs). It\u2019s a ridiculous board-game style set-up, the initial Sheriff court case was not justice, it was a farce! It was the aim of the clowns in the Scottish press to dehumanise Adnan Ahmed, objectify him, troll him and discredit his reputation in order to write scandalised, sensationalised lies as news stories. They did not write about his girlfriend and his mother being present to support him during the trial, as well as various male and female well-wishers and supporters dropping in and out during the proceedings. They did not report whole testimonials, only select words to demonise Ahmed further. The press even reported incidents Ahmed was found \u201cnot guilty\u201d of after the kangaroo-court show-trial finished. This is further grounds for him to sue for defamation, which he is in the process of doing! \nThe toilet paper news outlet made up fake charges of \u201ctargeting.\u201d Typical tabloid press style trash. Ahmed faced no charges of \u201ctargeting\u201d anyone, he was wrongfully convicted of section 38 breach of the peace. He won his appeal to overturn all false allegations and will sue the hounds at Glasgow Eyes Magazine for targeting him with their lies and filth! \nThese creeps have the cheek to accuse Addy Agame (an innocent man, proven not guilty and totally vindicated in the highest court in the country) of \u201ctargeting\u201d \u2013 really! This is an absolute lie, Addy was not found guilty of \u201ctargeting\u201d anyone, there were no charges of \u201ctargeting\u201d even lodged against him. \nHow does it feel to the scumbags at Glasgow Eyes Magazine to know they were disgustingly wrong and that Ahmed fought them all they way and embarrassed them by winning; maybe that\u2019s why they\u2019re so desperate to still demonise him, well cry a river you reptiles because you were well and truly defeated! \nAddy gave a statement at the trial also telling the court; \u201cno one involved (the women) thought anything untoward was going on until their perception was changed by how I was portrayed in the online and media smear campaign in January 2019 (referring to BBC Social\u2019s cyber-hate video). All of a sudden, a few warped people said I spoke to them like it was not just a quick chat. I could have asked someone the time and they would have reported it as being uncomfortable or intimidating.\u201d Many legal experts also agreed and re-iterated this throughout the trial. \nFollowing are links to Addy\u2019s actual statement to the press in January 2019 and the actual details of his appeal victory. \nBBC Social Reporter Myles Bonnar Set Up Adnan Ahmed a.k.a Addy Agame \u2013http://redpillrights.com/bbc-social-reporter-myles-bonnar-set-up-adnan-ahmed-a-k-a-addy-agame/ \nAdnan Ahmed aka Addy Agame Wins Appeal To Overturn Wrongful Conviction / Sentence Due To Miscarriage Of Justice And No Actual Crime To Answer To \u2013http://redpillrights.com/adnan-ahmed-aka-addy-agame-wins-appeal-to-overturn-wrongful-conviction-sentence-due-to-miscarriage-of-justice-and-no-actual-crime-to-answer-to/ \nThe bitter bum hack continued; \u201cnumber of women had been targeted.\u201d Well turns out they were lying because Ahmed was acquitted of all charges due to no crime to answer to, he should have them imprisoned for perjury! \nGlasgow Eyes Magazine are just butt-hurt because Ahmed proved them wrong, exposed them as liars and is now suing them!

One thing\u2019s for sure, they are fake news dirt-bags making false accusations because Ahmed was proven innocent in a court of law and \u201dall 5 women\u201d were proven to be lying perjurers, so no \u201doffences\u201d took place apart from by the women who lied under oath! \nThe sleazy hack sensationalised more stating; \u201cnumber of women targeted,\u201d no it was 5 liars who were proven to be perjurers, Ahmed was proven innocent \u2013 get that through your hollow head you idiot hack moron! \nThe sicko perv hack does what most creepy leftist hacks do, write \u201ctargeted\u201d and leave it open for negative, out-of-context, misinterpretation! \u201cTargeted\u201d via a polite fun conversation and planning a potential date \u2013 well, that would mean every one who practices any type of dating (online or otherwise) are \u201ctargeted\u201d one another \u2013 what an absolute classless pathetic reptile you are! \nOK you\u2019re doing that thing again where you make idiotic claims that are lies and leave it open to negative misinterpretation. Again \u201ctargeted\u201d after having a light chat consisting of passing polite remarks, because that\u2019s all it was, but you conveniently left that out you journalist dirt-bag! Also 3 top judges agreed that Ahmed was innocent and that \u201che didn\u2019t target anyone,\u201d as well as proving the 5 moron women making false allegations (of feeling uncomfortable despite giving positive feedback, before BBC Social made a hit-piece) as lying perjurers! Plus the hack took the quote \u201ctargeted\u201d from the disgraced judge from Ahmed\u2019s show-trial, the judge was disciplined and ridiculed by superior law chiefs for this corruption in dealing with Ahmed\u2019s case! This is a common press tactic, putting quotes from idiots into inverted commas to name-call the people they write about, isn\u2019t that right you \u201cpredator.\u201d \nThis idiot hack is full of it, what was \u201che caught\u201d for, \u201cbehaviour\u201d that is not legally a crime under Scottish law \u2013 and now it\u2019s official, so burn in hell you over-the-hill, has-been swine! Well actually, \u201cAhmed\u2019s behaviour\u201d has officially been described as \u201ctotally legal\u201d by 3 respected top judges in the highest court in Scotland thus Ahmed is officially \u201cnot a risk to women\u201d, the Scottish legal system and law books say so. \nHere are some more legal facts that brilliant senior judge Lord Turnbull stated; \u201cthere was nothing in the appellant\u2019s behaviour as spoken by complainers which was overly threatening or which could be construed as threatening. There was nothing in the appellant\u2019s conduct spoken by complainers which constituted threatening behaviour, witness described a compliment. Accordingly, the Sheriff erred in failing to give affect to no case to answer submissions presented on the appellants behalf in respect to these charges also. The exercise the Sheriff was engaged in had already lacked any element of clarification, the Sheriff appeared to be in the process of arguing with the appellant. Since the appeal against conviction is upheld on both grounds in all charges, the appeal against sentence flies off.\u201d \nCounsel for the appellant, Claire Mitchell QC, said that Sheriff Lindsay Wood\u2019s questions \u201cwould have led the independent observer to reach the view that the sheriff had formed an adverse view of his credibility\u201d. \nThe judges said the evidence did not indicate that Mr Ahmed was guilty of threatening behaviour. \nLord Turnbull wrote: \u201cIt does not seem to us that a polite conversational request or compliment can be construed as threatening merely because it is uninvited or unwelcome.\u201d \nSheriff Wood was also criticised by the judges for his \u201ccross-examination\u201d. \nLord Turnbull wrote: \u201cThe trial sheriff engaged in an exercise which could only be described as cross-examination. \n\u201cThe informed and impartial observer would readily have concluded that the sheriff had formed an adverse view on the credibility of the appellant\u2019s evidence. \n\u201cThe result was a miscarriage of justice and the appeal against conviction on each charge must be upheld on this ground.\u201d \nThe judges also found that Sheriff Wood\u2019s behaviour in telling advocate Donna Armstrong to sit down was \u201cunacceptable\u201d. \nLord Turnbull wrote: \u201cIn the present case counsel was correct to object to the sheriff\u2019s questioning when she did. \n\u201cIt is unacceptable for a judicial office holder to address a responsible practitioner by telling her to sit down. \n\u201cSuch behaviour carries the risk of demeaning the standing of the judiciary in the eyes of both the legal profession and of the public.\u201d \nAnd yes Addy has gained positive notoriety in men\u2019s rights political circles in which he is working and helping other men in similar circumstances who have been wronged by biased criminal and family courts. Ahmed is speaking at many public men\u2019s rights events as well as suing the state and media for compensation. Turns out his behaviour wasn\u2019t \u201cinappropriate\u201d and that is now official under Scottish law! Nothing was revealed except that the BBC are corrupt liars getting sued for defamation by Ahmed after he proved his innocence and proved them to be lying scumbags! \nYou idiots should at least learn to lie convincingly if that\u2019s how you\u2019re going to report fake news! The BBC flop-umentary they refer to is by creep Myles Bonnar, a low status creep trying to make a name for himself, by literally being a lying snitch. Cowardly racist Myles Bonnar has disappeared into nothingness again after selling himself out for fame (he has no actual skills / talent) by trying to destroy innocent men\u2019s lives because he\u2019s a spineless weasel who women find repulsive. \nBBC The Social hounded the Glasgow dating coach for months, he reached out to them and responded with a detailed explanation of his business model and background to his client base as well as the scientific reasoning behind this method of face-to-face daytime speed dating, which was in large ignored. Instead, they used choice sentences to turn up the controversy in order to create a story and demonise an innocent man. The police didn\u2019t act because of online videos, they were aware of them for years, they crumbled because of media pressure because Police Scotland is a Mickey Mouse force of hick villagers. \nIn all reality it was media rats like Glasgow Eyes Magazine that lost the public and taxpayers \u00a3100,000 plus in costs because they caused the fake hype around Addy Agame\u2019s \u201cno crime to answer\u201d case. A corrupt judge fell for it, as well as some less than intelligent police officers. However when Adnan Ahmed took his case to the highest court in Scotland \u2013 3 of the top judges in the country saw it for the \u201ctrial by media\u201d rubbish it was and quashed all the false convictions! \nIt\u2019s totally bizarre and shockingly worrying that a country\u2019s police force can\u2019t withstand pressure from online trolls and can be manipulated so easily by faceless crazies on the internet. Yes, Scotland is a very small country, but that does not excuse the stupid backward policing tactics used for this matter. There should never have been an arrest in the first place. The police were aware of Ahmed\u2019s dating business 3 years prior to BBC The Social\u2019s hate fuelled video falsely demonising him. They spoke to Mr Ahmed about it on a number of occasions in casual conversation. Both male and female officers approved of it. There are phone calls and written police reports to confirm this. \nPolice Scotland are supposed to investigate matters neutrally and without prejudice. Instead they contributed to the media mayhem by making comments defaming a man who is \u201dnot guilty\u201d of an actual crime, but was charged, indicted and remanded regardless. The police tried to fish for a conviction to cover their mistakes and to not face legal action themselves. \nThe creepy reporter stated\u00a0 more lies in the crappy article by quoting a random policeman \u2013 Mark McLennan who supposedly said; \u201cthe women approached were subjected to harassment and were frightened by his unwanted attention.\u201d This is false! Ahmed wasn\u2019t charged or tried for \u201charassment\u201d and no woman claimed to be \u201cfrightened\u201d and why does Mark McLennan feel it appropriate to talk in the media, he\u2019s supposed to be an impartial/ neutral officer of the law, not a media commentator. The lewd reporter continued to quote Mark McLennan; \u201cI pay tribute to the courage of these women coming forward giving evidence in order to bring Ahmed to justice, particularly as he appears to have expected them to tolerate his behaviour.\u201d Well Mr McLennan; firstly if they didn\u2019t come forward the police would have issued a warrant for their arrest, that\u2019s a fact. One witness who didn\u2019t want to come forward said the police harassed her and there were many like her who got caught in the social media hype in January 2019, but didn\u2019t want to go to court in September 2019 but felt forced by the police. \nSecondly Mr McLennan, Ahmed didn\u2019t commit a crime actually recognised under Scottish Law, this is the first time in human history a non-sense case like this has been tried in a Scottish Court. It\u2019s a shameful day when the police are run by Twitter trolls dictating their actions. What is a crime is Adnan Ahmed reporting Rita Bruce in early 2019 for sexually assaulting him numerous times \u2013 Police Scotland did nothing about this! The police need to get out of the news to get flimsy praise for convicting an innocent man for actions that are not a crime and actually go out there and fight / solve real crimes! Again Twitter should never have more power over justice than the actual police, apparently in Scotland they do! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQwbf_vB0qU \nAnd Mr McLennan, you said \u201cAhmed appears to have expected them to tolerate his unwarranted and unwelcome behaviour,\u201d when the majority of the women involved in the case admittedly gave Ahmed their mobile numbers and social media details! \nWhat is ironic is that days after Ahmed was wrongfully convicted, Police Scotland male officers were accused by Scottish women (and female officers) of \u201cthreatening and abusive behaviour.\u201d A group of Police Scotland officers called \u201cthe boys club\u201d are accused of sexual harassment/acts. One officer actually had sex with a \u201cvulnerable\u201d woman after she\u2019d just reported a crime, then proceeded to stalk her. She accused him of calling her \u201cpretty\u201d and \u201cintimidating\u201d her! Hopefully Mark McLennan is not involved in any of this controversy. Check it out; https://stv.tv/news/highlands-islands/1441340-police-boys-club-accused-of-targeting-crime-victims-for-sex/ \nThe scammers continued; \u201cfound guilty and held to account for his actions.\u201d Wrong, morons! All false accusers were proven to be lying perjurers because Ahmed was acquitted and found innocent in the high court! The false accusing witches were \u201cfortified\u201d as full-blown lying, racist, #MeToo, Karen, white women that made false allegations whilst giving evidence against a brown man because of his skin colour and to get pathetic attention via a media induced scandal! \nIf you mean Adnan Ahmed would emerge victorious and defeat everyone involved in his attempted demise by \u201cheld to account\u201d then ok, but the ironic fact is Sheriff Wood was the one \u201cheld to account\u201d by higher legal authorities for being a useless judge that is unable to do his job or serve justice via the actual law! Addy won, you lost, hope your idiotic press rant was worth your career being ended pal! Ahmed did nothing wrong and proved it in a high court in front of 3 real judges, not a donkey Sheriff who was trying to be a hero for the slimy Scottish press in a kangaroo-court show-trial! \nAhmed \u201cgave evidence\u201d the accusers were \u201clying or mistaken\u201d and was proven to be telling the truth in the high court (another L for you Sheriff Wood). The jury could think what they want \u2013 Ahmed got a \u201cnot guilty\u201d verdict for all charges in the high court (plus the jury were not impartial as they were brain-washed by the scumbags in the Scottish media). It wasn\u2019t \u201cobvious how they were affected\u201d as this was a witch-hunt created by the media, there was no crime in the first place \u2013 what\u2019s next the media will hype eating vegetables as misogynistic and a trial will be held hosting a bunch of idiots saying a man eating a carrot made them feel uncomfortable?! Get a grip on reality! \nAhmed\u2019s reputation is that he was acquitted, vindicated, found not guilty, proved his innocence and was right all along \u2013 while Sheriff Wood is now a laughing stock in Scottish Legal circles. \nThe most important fact is justice was done and Adnan Ahmed aka Addy Agame won his appeal to overturn the wrongful convictions and sentence due to a miscarriage of justice and no actual crime to answer to in September 2020!\u00a0 \nThe post Fake News Scumbag Amateurs \u201cGlasgow Eyes Magazine\u201d Promoted Wrongful Conviction Of Adnan Ahmed; He Then Exposed Them As Liars By Proving His Innocence In The High Court And The Sham Conviction Was Overturned! appeared first on red pill truth.",

                "text": "Joergen Oerstroem Moeller \neconomy, Europe \n \nBritain\u2019s problem is low productivity. EU membership could have helped.\nThe ghost haunting the British economy is low productivity. A study covering 2007\u20132016 shows a productivity growth per year of 0.1 percent, below Germany, France and Spain and at par with Italy. In 2015, just before Brexit came on stage, productivity in France was 27 percent and in Germany 35 percent higher than in Britain. Since then, until 2019 it has risen in the eurozone with 2.4 percent, Germany 3.1, France 3.4, Spain 1.5 and Britain on a par with Italy at 0.5 percent. \nInexplicably, no one has bothered to discuss whether Brexit will enhance productivity constituting the most serious barrier for retooling the economy.\u00a0\u00a0 \nEducation is vital, but feedback from universities paint Brexit as more harmful than helpful. The Erasmus Programme, orchestrating student exchange among EU member states, has scored high marks from teachers and students. Britain has left the program, which was regarded as a boon for students and a boost for British universities. \nThe Galileo satellite navigation program unmask how costly it is to launch programs on the edge of high-tech. After Brexit, Britain will not participate in its operation and development. The plan to build a more or less similar national system was abandoned because of costs. An alternative is being considered, but it will be neither easy nor cheap. These kinds of programs may in the long run engineer spin-offs that benefit the economy as a whole. Inside of the EU, the cost-benefit through cost-sharing may have been profitable for Britain. Outside of the EU, the cost-benefit turns against Britain. \nLower regulatory framework is mentioned as an arrow in the quiver to stimulate the economy, albeit it is questionable to say the least, why Britain should be able to throw off various regulations after having left the EU. Much of the red tape is not a result of EU membership, but due to domestic pressure. The support for the protection of the environment, climate change, and safety and health are strong. The unions\u201423.5 percent of workers equal to 3.7 million are still members\u2014would certainly resist any deterioration of working conditions.\u00a0\u00a0 \nThe Christmas Eve agreement contains a clause about the level playing field. It can be taken for granted that the EU will move fast in case Britain tries to work around that commitment. Prime Minister Boris Johnson\u2019s request to business leaders on Jan. 7, barely two weeks after the agreement was struck, to help rip up regulations will lead to raised eyebrows and is more likely than not to trigger off a confrontation with the EU. It is the kind of political signals that gives rise to suspicion about duplicity. With such a policy in mind leaving without an agreement might have been preferable. \nThe idea of deregulation as an instrument to turn Britain into \u201cSingapore-on-Thames\u201d is alluring in the eyes of some Brexiteers, but the result is much more likely to be \u201cBangladesh-on-Thames.\u201d Cutting labor costs is the competitive parameter chosen, not higher productivity. Most economists would be immensely reluctant to recommend such a course\u2014for political, social and economic reasons. \nNor does freedom to enter into free trade agreements (FTAs) with non-EU countries, hold much promise. No clarification is at hand to impart why productivity should go up because of FTAs, why Britain outside the EU should be able to trade more with third countries than inside and why FTAs which focus on goods while Britain\u2019s competitive edge is found in services will boost the economy.\u00a0 \nSo far, FTAs have been concluded with seventy countries, but sixty of those means that trade will continue with the country in question on exactly the same terms as the EU agreements entered into when Britain was a member\u2014a kind of rollover.\u00a0 \nThe hard nut to crack is that not only must productivity growth be achieved, but it must be higher than for competitors already in the lead.\u00a0\u00a0 \nA big financial commitment is required. Where is the money though? The national debt is at its highest level since the early 1960s. The corporate sector looks close to a rerun of the high indebtedness in the slipstream of the Global Financial Crisis. Investment from outside is becoming less attractive without access to the Single Market. \nThe EU agreed last year on a stimulus of \u20ac1.8 trillion to rebuild a post-coronavirus Europe. The ambition is a greener, more digital and more resilient Europe. Somewhat heretically, maybe Britain should have stayed inside the EU, agreed to this program and used it to modernize the economy. Isn\u2019t it exactly what the British government would love to do? Also, the EU has not run into obstacles when looking for finance. \nJoergen Oerstroem Moeller is a former state-secretary for the Royal Danish Foreign Ministry and the author of\u202fThe Veil of Circumstance: Technology, Values, Dehumanization and the Future of Economics and Politics, ISEAS, Singapore, 2016.\u202f\u202f\u00a0 \nImage: Reuters",

You would be correct to ask this. They claim to be a news site but they report blatant lies mostly. These wannabe reporters claim to bring their very few readers news from Pakistan \u2013 they are full of sh*t. They just steal articles from feminist, white-supremacist, left-wing racists like \u201cThe Scottish Media\u201d and pretend it\u2019s their own. \nAdd the horribly amateur look of the thenation.org.uk website to this pile of crap and you\u2019ve got a joke of a news provider (quite like the Scottish Media as a whole). A tip for our readers, seek out real news on Pakistan through trusted objective news outlets, not sell-out sites like thenation.org.uk who push the poison of the very scum (The Scottish Media) who colonised and enslaved them. \nKashmir News Are Well Known For Lying And Having To Make Corrections And Apologies For The Fake News Garbage They Publish\nThe dirty, creepy, twisted journo who wrote the article is a scummy liar that attempts to make a pathetic living off demonising masculine men because the hack is a spineless moron! The seedy sleaze-ball hack calls Addy \u201cthreatening and abusive\u201d in the trash article dated 22nd Oct 2019 for embarrassing joke news scum thenation.org.uk! \nAhmed is not threatening or abusive \u2013 that is a proven fact under Scottish law as Addy was acquitted, cleared and proven innocent of all false allegations in the high court! What is threatening and abusive is writing shameless virtue-signalling crap in a social justice moron fashion to trick women into thinking you are an ally, when in reality you are trying to friend-zone your way into sleeping with them if you\u2019re a simp mangina beta male; or simply hate and envy men because you are too irresponsible / delusional to take responsibility for your own failed life if you\u2019re a feminazi \u2013 sound familiar?! Also making up fake sexually suggestive accusations of \u201cthreats and abuse\u201d should be a sexual offence and any journo hack doing so should be labelled a life-long sex offender \u2013 do you agree?! \nThe sicko perv hack does what most creepy leftist hacks do, write \u201cthreatening and abusive\u201d and leave it open for negative, out-of-context, misinterpretation! \u201cThreatening and abusive\u201d via a polite fun conversation and planning a potential date \u2013 well, that would mean every one who practices any type of dating (YouTube or otherwise) are \u201cthreatening and abusing\u201d one another \u2013 what an absolute classless pathetic reptile you are! \nThe rancid hack continued in this fashion stating; \u201cvictims gave evidence about how they had been alarmed and intimidated.\u201d OK you\u2019re doing that thing again where you make idiotic claims that are lies and leave it open to negative misinterpretation. Again \u201calarmed and intimidated\u201d after having a light chat consisting of passing polite remarks, because that\u2019s all it was, there was absolutely no sexual aspect whatsoever, which was proven in the high court of appeal but you conveniently left that out you journalist dirt-bag! Also 3 top judges agreed that Ahmed was innocent and that \u201che didn\u2019t alarm or intimidate anyone,\u201d as well as proving the 5 moron women making false allegations (of feeling uncomfortable despite giving positive feedback, before BBC Social made a hit-piece) as lying perjurers! Plus the hack took the quote \u201d alarmed and intimidated\u201d from the disgraced judge from Ahmed\u2019s show-trial, the judge was disciplined and ridiculed by superior law chiefs for this corruption in dealing with Ahmed\u2019s case! This is a common press tactic, putting quotes from idiots into inverted commas to name-call the people they write about, isn\u2019t that right you \u201cpredator.\u201d \nThe weirdo hack stated; \u201cwould approach female strangers\u201d \u2013 what is wrong with that, does the deviant journo only consider people he/she knows to be romantic options (i.e. family members, friends, maybe even animals, now that is totally creepy). \n\n\n2 Year Sentence Is Reversed And His Lawyers Seek Compensation For His Wrongful Imprisonment\n\n\nTaken Off The Offenders Register Due To; No Crime Taking Place, Incompetent Brainwashed Judge And Jury, And Press Corruption!\n\n\nWhistle-Blower Exposed For Creating Witch-Hunt Because She Sexually Assaulted And Racially Abused Him!\n\n\nJudge Who \u201cHit Out\u201d (At Addy Agame) Is Disciplined, Punished And Rebuked By His Superiors As Addy Wins Appeal To Have Wrongful Conviction Overturned Due To Miscarriage Of Justice Resulting From Media-Puppet Judge\u2019s Conduct\n\n\nFake News Hack Creeps Humiliated And Exposed As Dishonest Liars And Incapable Journalist Morons\n\n\nFalse Accusers Proven To Be Liars And To Be Faking \u201cMental Scarring\u201d As Nothing Happened But Passing Polite Remarks\n\n\nThe hack is a typical modern-day reporter, jumping on demonising narratives to increase page views for disgraced news site thenation.org.uk. The reporter is an airhead, moaning about the usual social justice virtue signalling garbage leftist idiots cry about to score social points. This hack is your usual \u201cwoke\u201d socialised idiot that splutters from the usual social justice script, despite scientific evidence proving otherwise! thenation.org.uk don\u2019t care about facts, it\u2019s all about virtue-signalling the latest activism trend for discriminatory morons like them. \nthenation.org.uk\u00a0doesn\u2019t report truth or have any originality at all \u2013 even the journalists are nameless, faceless cowards! One particular coward wrote articles about Adnan Ahmed\u2019s wrongful conviction / show-trial by the media and the complete miscarriage of justice he experienced (Adnan Ahmed aka Addy Agame won his appeal to overturn the wrongful conviction and sentence due to a miscarriage of justice and no actual crime to answer to in September 2020). The reporter is most likely a low-life bitter media hack, too spineless to reveal their actual identity, in pathetic fear that Red Pill groups will expose them for the seedy scumbag liars they are. Men\u2019s rights are human rights; hence why we represent the truth without succumbing to what mainstream media propaganda wants to brain-wash the masses to think. \nThe obvious problem with leftist SJW reporters and press is that they are trained to be deceitful and to sensationalise the truth by reporting inaccurate falsehoods that allow them to just about get away with telling lies because of how the misinformation is presented to simply imply something false as true. For a sneaky reporter it is a tactic used to be a creepy stalker and to attack others, whilst keeping their filthy laundry private! \nthenation.org.uk\u00a0is an outlet set-up for coward reporters to spam their fake news (whilst pretending it\u2019s by another journalist). Scummy journalists basically just spam the same lies and inaccuracies in as many pages as possible in order to make it look like different people are talking about the same thing. This (they think) gives their stories weight as it tricks the public into believing a story because it looks like it is coming from various sources! Read Ryan Holiday\u2019s book \u201cTrust me, I\u2019m lying\u201d for a full understanding of how the media manipulate the public and destroy reputations without facing any repercussions. \nYep, we have another woke, radical social justice moron and self-proclaimed man-hater. There seems to be a direct correlation between social justice moron journalists that write garbage and that are borderline sociopaths. Que bad haircut, even worse dress-sense and below average looks and we have our latest social justice moron hate-pusher. \nThe rancid reporter doesn\u2019t have a personality or an original thought in their head. The hack is the epitome of a constructed fake person attempting to tick certain socially acceptable boxes because they are an approval chasing loser with low self-esteem. They comes across as a child desperately wanting people to like them, which in turn makes people dislike them! \nThe horrendous hack writes for scummy virtue signalling fake news site thenation.org.uk. Amongst thenation.org.uk\u2019s creepy articles about man-hating and petty gossip is a sea of radical social justice moron / simp / man-hating / woke brainwashing drivel! Don\u2019t read thenation.org.uk, it\u2019s written by bitter idiots for bitter idiots. It will only serve to ruin balanced feminine women and grounded masculine men. thenation.org.uk is propaganda for idiots too stupid and conditioned to see through the disgusting social justice moron narrative! \nEPISODE 1-\u00a0 \u201dMainstream Media Demonisation Of Addy Agame\u201d \u2013\u00a0https://youtu.be/EUbs7CozXyI \nEPISODE 2 \u2013 \u201dThe BBC\u2019s Manipulation / Defamation Of Street Attraction\u201d \u2013\u00a0https://youtu.be/fTxL7T_Kh1w \nEPISODE 3 \u2013\u00a0 \u201dInfield Videos & False Allegations\u201d \u2013\u00a0https://youtu.be/ztKtdE33vFU \nEPISODE 4 \u2013 \u201dHistory, Society, Politics & Feminazis\u201d \u2013\u00a0https://youtu.be/BLJK1TKK5TQ \nAdnan Ahmed Acquitted And Cleared Of All False Allegation Of Acting In Threatening Or Abusive Manner (Which Is Basically Just Section 38 Breach Of The Peace)\u00a0\nthenation.org.uk\u00a0are morons who lie to sensationalise nonsense in order to push articles via their pathetic news outlet, as well as influence unsuspecting members of the public. These idiots don\u2019t fact check at all, as is evident via their stupid hit-piece article by cowardly \u201ccourt reporter\u201d on October 22nd, 2019 regarding Addy Agame. \nTurns out Addy was right all along as all false allegations were dropped, all charges were reversed, and all wrongful convictions were overturned. Looks like scummy thenation.org.uk got it totally wrong as usual! The fake news slime-balls even called Addy a \u201cpick-up artist.\u201d Again misinformation, as Adnan Ahmed has said on many occasions, \u201cI am not a pick-up artist, I\u2019m a dating and life coach, we help people using scientific self-help \u2013 not tricks, techniques, lines and tactics.\u201d Addy\u2019s innocence was so clear cut that despite the underhanded tactics the sleazy Scottish press employed, he was found not guilty and defeated them! \nThe spineless creep journo has a slimy bitter bratty writing manner that reflects his poncey geek personality. The sleazy reporter lacked the back-bone to make their wasted education count for anything and ended up writing for fake news site, thenation.org.uk. The creepy sleaze is a charmless bore, this is evident via this lame article\u00a0 about monotonous drivel. The perv loser will forever be mad at alpha males who go out and win in life! \nThe hack is most likely unattractive, overweight, has below average looks and a horrible personality. This horrible evil deviant mutant specialises in fraud journalism. The clowns at thenation.org.uk are professional seedy stalkers, whose job entails hounding people and desperately begging for stories for less than minimum wage. Vultures at thenation.org.uk invent entire scenarios, casts of characters and reams of dialogue in their article about wrongfully convicted dating coach Addy Agame. \nDog-hacks at thenation.org.uk are at again. The try-hard, bitter joke of a reporter wrote a crappy article in October 2019 celebrating Ahmed\u2019s wrongful conviction / imprisonment \u2013 which has now been completely reversed and quashed! The reporters track record of corny and disgusting articles that are spewed out as some sort of alarmist warped trash is evident from their past work. The sickening clown reporter doesn\u2019t care about helping people, the chubby journo only cares about pushing fake news down the throats of anyone unfortunate enough to come across their crazed ramblings. The hack gives off the air of a deranged person with \u201cwoke\u201d perspectives gathered from confused social media posts and from the sinister shallow masks of gaping insecurities and an inferiority complex. \nThe fraudster hack mentions Addy Agame in order to dirty his name further by associating him with issues that have nothing to do with him and that are not even issues in the first place. This is a disgusting abuse of journalistic responsibility, ridiculously predatory reporting and sham news \u2013 well we expect nothing less from this hack to make up a pointless story just to try to hurt someone\u2019s reputation, at least Ahmed punished slimy reporter hacks by winning his appeal to prove his innocence and expose thenation.org.uk\u2019s pathetic poisonous tactics! \nAhmed\u2019s wrongful conviction being quashed basically proves the hack wrong and Addy right \u2013 the cry baby doesn\u2019t seem to be handling it too well. thenation.org.uk pathetically tried to demonise Ahmed by saying \u201csecretly filmed videos posted on YouTube,\u201d he didn\u2019t \u201cfilm himself,\u201d plus it\u2019s not illegal to do so, it\u2019s a common press tactic. \nAgain he didn\u2019t film himself, he was being filmed you idiots! Ahmed was not charged with this because it is not a crime! It may be immoral to some, but who the hell are thenation.org.uk to talk about morality to anyone, they\u2019ve been caught with their pants down and exposed hundreds of thousands of times. Stop whining you alarmist idiots. This is no different from how media hypocrites like you and sleazy Myles Bonnar film people without their consent and post / broadcast it. What\u2019s \u201chorrific\u201d is thenation.org.uk and Bonnar don\u2019t conceal the identities of the people they demonise for personal gain \u2013 these coaches at least did protect the identities of the females they interacted with. And how are others supposed to learn if there are no video examples?! Ultimately \u2013 this is not illegal under UK law. You seem to have more of a problem with the law, rather than an actual valid issue. \nThe sleazy scumbag stated; \u201cAhmed found guilty of acting in threatening and abusive manner.\u201d In reality Ahmed was wrongfully convicted by a biased jury who were influenced by an online social media campaign and horrible selective press reporting during every turn of his trial (by Scottish media scum). Even though it was clearly stated in court; \u201cthis is not a crime; being confident is not a crime, having a conversation is not a crime, witness is unreliable, asking someone out is not a crime, if you have any inclination of reasonable doubt \u2013 he\u2019s innocent, people\u2019s perspectives were skewed by how Ahmed was portrayed in a online/ media hate campaign.\u201d Ahmed was actually wrongfully convicted of section 38 breach of the peace which is equivalent to raising one\u2019s voice too loud outdoors, complete madness! Here\u2019s how the jury process works in Scotland, there is no screening for racist, feminist, prejudice or psychiatric deficiencies (unlike the USA). 15 members of the public are selected at random and simply told, \u201cdon\u2019t go on social media or media\u201d without any enforcement or checks conducted during the trial. Ahmed\u2019s jury was made up of 9 females and 6 males (some of which were programmed by the media to hate him, some pudgy beta males and some angry underweight feminists), the wrongful non-majority \u201cguilty\u201d verdict was appealed and overturned in September 2020 as no crime was actually committed! Ahmed maintained his innocence, all 18 of the fake charges were dropped due to all allegations being false! Adnan Ahmed did not receive a fair trial and is not guilty of any criminal conduct \u2013 that is the official legal outcome of this bizarre thenation.org.uk witch-hunt! Addy won; the media, the trolls and his false accusers were defeated by him! \nThe jury and accusers are asked to take an \u201coath to God\u201d to ensure an unbiased testimony, without individuals even being screened to see if they even believe in God (in an age of rampant atheist beliefs). It\u2019s a ridiculous board-game style set-up, the initial Sheriff court case was not justice, it was a farce! It was the aim of the clowns in the Scottish press to dehumanise Adnan Ahmed, objectify him, troll him and discredit his reputation in order to write scandalised, sensationalised lies as news stories. They did not write about his girlfriend and his mother being present to support him during the trial, as well as various male and female well-wishers and supporters dropping in and out during the proceedings. They did not report whole testimonials, only select words to demonise Ahmed further. The press even reported incidents Ahmed was found \u201cnot guilty\u201d of after the kangaroo-court show-trial finished. This is further grounds for him to sue for defamation, which he is in the process of doing! \nThe toilet paper news outlet made up fake charges of \u201cfilming and posting.\u201d Typical tabloid press style trash. Ahmed faced no charges of \u201cfilming or posting\u201d anyone, he was wrongfully convicted of section 38 breach of the peace. He won his appeal to overturn all false allegations and will sue the hounds at thenation.org.uk for targeting him with their lies and filth! \nThese creeps have the cheek to accuse Addy Agame (an innocent man, proven not guilty and totally vindicated in the highest court in the country) of \u201cfilming and posting\u201d \u2013 really! This is an absolute lie, Addy was not found guilty of \u201cfilming or posting\u201d anyone, there were no charges of \u201cfilming or posting\u201d even lodged against him. \nHow does it feel to the scumbags at thenation.org.uk to know they were disgustingly wrong and that Ahmed fought them all they way and embarrassed them by winning; maybe that\u2019s why they\u2019re so desperate to still demonise him, well cry a river you reptiles because you were well and truly defeated! \nAddy gave a statement at the trial also telling the court; \u201cno one involved (the women) thought anything untoward was going on until their perception was changed by how I was portrayed in the online and media smear campaign in January 2019 (referring to BBC Social\u2019s cyber-hate video). All of a sudden, a few warped people said I spoke to them like it was not just a quick chat. I could have asked someone the time and they would have reported it as being uncomfortable or intimidating.\u201d Many legal experts also agreed and re-iterated this throughout the trial. \nFollowing are links to Addy\u2019s actual statement to the press in January 2019 and the actual details of his appeal victory. \nBBC Social Reporter Myles Bonnar Set Up Adnan Ahmed a.k.a Addy Agame \u2013http://redpillrights.com/bbc-social-reporter-myles-bonnar-set-up-adnan-ahmed-a-k-a-addy-agame/ \nAdnan Ahmed aka Addy Agame Wins Appeal To Overturn Wrongful Conviction / Sentence Due To Miscarriage Of Justice And No Actual Crime To Answer To \u2013http://redpillrights.com/adnan-ahmed-aka-addy-agame-wins-appeal-to-overturn-wrongful-conviction-sentence-due-to-miscarriage-of-justice-and-no-actual-crime-to-answer-to/ \nThe bitter bum hack continued; \u201c5 women gave evidence abut being alarmed / intimidated.\u201d Well turns out they were lying because Ahmed was acquitted of all charges due to no crime to answer to, he should have them imprisoned for perjury! \nthenation.org.uk are just butt-hurt because Ahmed proved them wrong, exposed them as liars and is now suing them! thenation.org.uk are scumbags, that make a living from spreading lies, fake news and defaming innocent people. \n\nChloe From Lenzie Discuses Her Rendezvous With Addy Agame \u2013http://redpillrights.com/chloe-from-lenzie-discuses-her-rendezvous-with-addy-agame/\nTia From Glasgow Talks About Dating Addy Agame \u2013http://redpillrights.com/tia-from-glasgow-talks-about-dating-addy-agame/\nAisha From Saudi Arabia Describes Her Holiday Romance With Adnan Ahmed (aka Addy Agame) \u2013http://redpillrights.com/aisha-from-saudi-arabia-describes-her-holiday-romance-with-adnan-ahmed-aka-addy-agame/\nJill From Sheffield Gives Honest Feedback On Her Positive Experience With Addy Agame \u2013http://redpillrights.com/jill-from-sheffield-gives-honest-feedback-on-her-positive-experience-with-addy-agame/\nChristine From China Discusses Meeting And Dating Addy Agame Truthfully-http://redpillrights.com/christine-from-china-discusses-meeting-and-dating-addy-agame-truthfully/\nCanadian Karen Describes Her \u201cLovely\u201d Chance Meeting With Addy Agame In Uddingston \u2013http://redpillrights.com/canadian-karen-describes-her-lovely-chance-meeting-with-addy-agame-in-uddingston/\nGlasgow Dating Coach Adnan Ahmed a.k.a Addy Agame Helps Football Referee In Australia With His Dating Life \u2013http://redpillrights.com/glasgow-dating-coach-adnan-ahmed-a-k-a-addy-agame-helps-football-referee-in-australia-with-his-dating-life/\nGlasgow Dating Coach Adnan Ahmed a.k.a Addy Agame Helps Personal Trainer In London With His Dating Life \u2013http://redpillrights.com/glasgow-dating-coach-adnan-ahmed-a-k-a-addy-agame-helps-personal-trainer-in-london-with-his-dating-life/\nGlasgow Dating Coach Adnan Ahmed a.k.a Addy Agame Helps Joiner In Edinburgh \u2013http://redpillrights.com/glasgow-dating-coach-adnan-ahmed-a-k-a-addy-agame-helps-joiner-in-edinburgh/\nGlasgow Dating Coach Adnan Ahmed a.k.a Addy Agame Helps IT Specialist In London \u2013http://redpillrights.com/glasgow-dating-coach-adnan-ahmed-a-k-a-addy-agame-helps-it-specialist-in-london/\nGlasgow Dating Coach Adnan Ahmed a.k.a Addy Agame Helps Video Editor In Spain \u2013http://redpillrights.com/glasgow-dating-coach-adnan-ahmed-a-k-a-addy-agame-helps-video-editor-in-spain/\nGlasgow Dating Coach Addy Agame Helps Marketing Expert In Glasgow \u2013http://redpillrights.com/glasgow-dating-coach-adnan-ahmed-a-k-a-addy-agame-helps-marketing-expert-in-glasgow/\n\nThe creeps at thenation.org.uk grasped at straws by quoting the disgraced and rebuked judge, they stated, \u201cSheriff Lindsay Wood sent Ahmed to prison for 2 years and put him on the sex offenders register for 10 years\u2026\u201d Well merely months later Ahmed appealed this corrupt judge\u2019s wrong decision and reversed the wrongful verdict, proving his innocence fully, Ahmed was removed from the register because he committed no sexual offences or crimes at all! \nThe moron Sheriff was wrong and is now viewed as a complete embarrassment to his profession as there was \u201cno sexual aspect whatsoever,\u201d look it up in the Scottish Law books, Lindsay Wood gets a grilling and is completely put in his place as being a dunce of a judge by his legal superiors! \nSo there were no offences as no convictions exist, no crime took place \u2013 are thenation.org.uk dumb or are they gas-lighting and defaming an innocent man?! One thing\u2019s for sure, they are fake news dirt-bags making false accusations because Ahmed was proven innocent in a court of law and \u201dall 5 women\u201d were proven to be lying perjurers, so no \u201doffences\u201d took place apart from by the women who lied under oath! \nReasons For Appeal; \n\nThe trial judge caused a miscarriage of justice via his bias and discriminatory misconduct, especially when he elected to cross examine the accused at the end of the defence\u2019s case\nThe judge erred in repelling the \u2018no case (crime) to answer submissions\u2018 made under Scottish law for all the charges the accused was wrongfully convicted of, causing a miscarriage of justice\nIt was impossible for the accused to receive a fair trial based on the manner the police sought out complainers\nIt was impossible for the accused to receive a fair trial because the Scottish press influenced the jury / public negatively both before and during the trial, causing a miscarriage of justice\nIt was impossible for the accused to receive a fair trial because the social worker initially allocated, and the trial judge were influenced by press propaganda during the trial causing a miscarriage of justice\nThe social workers report was prejudicial and relied on opinion from the press rather than impartiality from a professional standpoint\nThe was NO sexual element / aggravation / motivation \u2013 the accused was running a dating business for a monetary purpose not for sexual gratification\nThere was NO actual sexual offense committed and NO actual sexual convictions, hence notification requirements were the wrong outcome, causing a miscarriage of justice\n\nScotland is in an extremely regressive, backwards, violent and ugly era of criminal justice. Legal precedents and crazy laws are being made up on the spot without political clearance. How can a sheriff / judge justify wrongfully convicting a man of something that is not a crime by simply labelling it \u2018breach of the peace\u2019 or \u2018threatening / abusive behaviour?\u2019 Even so, none of the convictions were sexual offences, putting a person on the sex offenders register for 10 years despite that person not even being convicted of a sexual offence is a disgrace! Simply stating there may have been that motivation is a farcical miscarriage of justice and total lunacy \u2013 Sheriff Lindsay Wood was playing up to the press in order to be quoted so he could gain accolade and praise. He himself should face legal action for using a court of law in such a manner. Wood is a man who enabled the media\u2019s prejudicial imperative by default in his legislative actions, judgement and ruling, reflexively and emotionally driven, without genuine judicial insight. Simply put the man is an incompetent imbecile. \nIf someone hasn\u2019t committed any sexual offences at all, no register should be required. Ahmed\u2019s wrongful conviction was \u201csection 38 breach of the peace.\u201d There was no sexual element, it was chatting! A Sheriff should not be influenced by other cases or the media, they have a duty to be impartial and to do the right thing by the law! The law should always overrule the media; however, it seems to be the opposite way around in Scotland. This insanity occurring meant any man chatting up any woman in Scotland (whether it be during the day or in a nightclub) will be at risk of being put on the sex offenders register, even if no sexual offence has occurred! Luckily Ahmed\u2019s victory ensured that chatting up women in Scotland is now 100% legal! \n3 of the highest judges in Scotland agreed with Ahmed and stated the evidence did not indicate Ahmed did anything wrong! Ahmed was totally correct, he also never called himself a \u201cvictim.\u201d despite the sleazy media trying oh so hard to stop him; he beat the fake charges and the fake news media in one swift motion \u2013 wow, what a man! \nAnd the public are not wise to anything but the facts, which are \u201cAdnan Ahmed was totally acquitted, found innocent and given a not guilty verdict by 3 intelligent highly ranked judges because there was no crime to answer to and this idiot Sheriff who ran the trial caused a complete miscarriage of justice due to his SJW views and insane conduct.\u201d \nHere are some more legal facts that brilliant senior judge Lord Turnbull stated; \u201cthere was nothing in the appellant\u2019s behaviour as spoken by complainers which was overly threatening or which could be construed as threatening. There was nothing in the appellant\u2019s conduct spoken by complainers which constituted threatening behaviour, witness described a compliment. Accordingly, the Sheriff erred in failing to give affect to no case to answer submissions presented on the appellants behalf in respect to these charges also. The exercise the Sheriff was engaged in had already lacked any element of clarification, the Sheriff appeared to be in the process of arguing with the appellant. Since the appeal against conviction is upheld on both grounds in all charges, the appeal against sentence flies off.\u201d \nFirstly there were no victims because there was no crime, they were proven to be liars and Ahmed was found not guilty. Secondly, the lack of mental intellect of the Sheriff\u2019s statement will not leave \u2013 ever, because no one was \u201calarmed and intimidated\u201d by a passing conversation / remarks, as all false accusers were proven to be lying perjurers because Ahmed was acquitted and found innocent in the high court! Thirdly, the false accusing witches were \u201cfortified\u201d as full-blown lying, racist, #MeToo, Karen, white women that made false allegations whilst giving evidence against a brown man because of his skin colour and to get pathetic attention via a media induced scandal! \nLastly, if you mean Adnan Ahmed would emerge victorious and defeat everyone involved in his attempted demise by \u201cheld to account\u201d then ok, but the ironic fact is Sheriff Wood was the one \u201cheld to account\u201d by higher legal authorities for being a useless judge that is unable to do his job or serve justice via the actual law! Addy won, you lost, hope your idiotic press rant was worth your career being ended pal! \nThe hack went onto quote the disgraced media-influenced rebuked judge, stating: \u201cSheriff Wood said Ahmed had a lack of remorse.\u201d Well, that\u2019s because Ahmed did nothing wrong and proved it in a high court in front of 3 real judges, not a donkey Sheriff who was trying to be a hero for the slimy Scottish press in a kangaroo-court show-trial! The hack continued; \u201che told him: you gave evidence and said the victims were lying or mistaken; but the jury thought otherwise. It was obvious when they gave evidence how they were affected.\u201d Eh, no! Firstly \u2013 there were no \u201cvictims\u201d as no crime was committed (that\u2019s official now in the Scottish law books and legal records). Secondly, Ahmed \u201cgave evidence\u201d the accusers were \u201clying or mistaken\u201d and was proven to be telling the truth in the high court (another L for you Sheriff Wood). Thirdly, the jury could think what they want \u2013 Ahmed got a \u201cnot guilty\u201d verdict for all charges in the high court (plus the jury were not impartial as they were brain-washed by the scumbags in the Scottish media). Lastly, it wasn\u2019t \u201cobvious how they were affected\u201d as this was a witch-hunt created by the media, there was no crime in the first place \u2013 what\u2019s next the media will hype eating vegetables as misogynistic and a trial will be held hosting a bunch of idiots saying a man eating a carrot made them feel uncomfortable?! Get a grip on reality! \nThe idiots at thenation.org.uk continued to quote the shamed Sheriff trying to gain clout by co-signing social justice nonsense, they stated (quoting the shamed Sheriff); \u201cyou have acquired notoriety and an unenviable reputation, the public will be wise to such inappropriate behaviour by you and others like you.\u201d Turns out you were wrong again Sheriff. Ahmed\u2019s reputation is that he was acquitted, vindicated, found not guilty, proved his innocence and was right all along \u2013 while Sheriff Wood is now a laughing stock in Scottish Legal circles, here is what his superiors had to say about his \u201cunenviable reputation\u201d \u2013 \nThe shamed sheriff was criticised by 3 high court judges for conducting a \u201ccross-examination\u201d of a defendant and telling his representative to \u201csit down\u201d. \nCounsel for the appellant, Claire Mitchell QC, said that Sheriff Lindsay Wood\u2019s questions \u201cwould have led the independent observer to reach the view that the sheriff had formed an adverse view of his credibility\u201d. \nThe judges said the evidence did not indicate that Mr Ahmed was guilty of threatening behaviour. \nLord Turnbull wrote: \u201cIt does not seem to us that a polite conversational request or compliment can be construed as threatening merely because it is uninvited or unwelcome.\u201d \nSheriff Wood was also criticised by the judges for his \u201ccross-examination\u201d. \nLord Turnbull wrote: \u201cThe trial sheriff engaged in an exercise which could only be described as cross-examination. \n\u201cThe informed and impartial observer would readily have concluded that the sheriff had formed an adverse view on the credibility of the appellant\u2019s evidence. \n\u201cThe result was a miscarriage of justice and the appeal against conviction on each charge must be upheld on this ground.\u201d \nThe judges also found that Sheriff Wood\u2019s behaviour in telling advocate Donna Armstrong to sit down was \u201cunacceptable\u201d. \nLord Turnbull wrote: \u201cIn the present case counsel was correct to object to the sheriff\u2019s questioning when she did. \n\u201cIt is unacceptable for a judicial office holder to address a responsible practitioner by telling her to sit down. \n\u201cSuch behaviour carries the risk of demeaning the standing of the judiciary in the eyes of both the legal profession and of the public.\u201d \nAnd yes Addy has gained positive notoriety in men\u2019s rights political circles in which he is working and helping other men in similar circumstances who have been wronged by biased criminal and family courts. Ahmed is speaking at many public men\u2019s rights events as well as suing the state and media for compensation. Turns out his behaviour wasn\u2019t \u201cinappropriate\u201d and that is now official under Scottish law! \nThere were no offences as no convictions exist, no crime took place \u2013 are thenation.org.uk dumb or are they gas-lighting and defaming an innocent man?! One thing\u2019s for sure, they are fake news dirt-bags making false accusations because Ahmed was proven innocent in a court of law and the \u201d5 women\u201d were proven to be lying perjurers, so no \u201doffences\u201d took place apart from by the women who lied under oath! \nThe pathetic geek desperado hack continued; \u201dAhmed disputed his actions were unlawful\u2026accused victims of misconstruing him. His lawyer told the court he had not intended to cause fear or alarm.\u201d Ahmed and his lawyer were 100% correct, 3 of the highest judges in Scotland agreed and acquitted Ahmed accordingly, clearing him of all false accusations from the phony ambulance / attention/ fame chasing fake victims! \nNo Sheriff, you\u2019re roundabout way to disguise your clout-chasing to appease a corrupt Scottish press who manufactured a scandal out of nothing about a dating coach (because he debunked feminist dating tactics as a farce) was exposed \u2013 there was no \u201ccriminal trend\u201d except your irresponsible behaviour as a law official, hope it was worth destroying your reputation and career over.\u00a0 And shut up you idiot journo, there was no \u201coutrage\u201d and there were no \u201ccrimes\u201d \u2013 Ahmed was found \u201cnot guilty\u201d by 3 judges on the basis that his unfortunate circumstances were a \u201cmiscarriage of justice\u201d and the incidents were legally labelled \u201cno crime to answer to.\u201d \nCheck out the following links to the failed protest (under 10 people) constructed by feminist morons who work for BBC The Social (who caused this miscarriage of lies), as well as Addy\u2019s response to proving his innocent; \nMentally Ill Feminist Mandy Jones Staged Failed Rally Against Red Pill Dating Coach Addy Agame \u2013\u00a0https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjxiLbXQ8SA \nEPISODE 5 \u2013 \u201dAddy Agame Proven Innocent And Acquitted Of All Charges\u201d \u2013\u00a0https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpdrQYa8u7A \nThe horrid hack continued; \u201cpolice began an investigation after his behaviour was revealed by BBC The Social.\u201d Nothing was revealed except that the BBC are corrupt liars getting sued for defamation by Ahmed after he proved his innocence and proved them to be lying scumbags! \nYou idiots should at least learn to lie convincingly if that\u2019s how you\u2019re going to report! The BBC flop-umentary they refer to is by creep Myles Bonnar, a low status creep trying to make a name for himself, by literally being a lying snitch. Cowardly racist Myles Bonnar has disappeared into nothingness again after selling himself out for fame (he has no actual skills / talent) by trying to destroy innocent men\u2019s lives because he\u2019s a spineless weasel who women find repulsive. \nBBC The Social hounded the Glasgow dating coach for months, he reached out to them and responded with a detailed explanation of his business model and background to his client base as well as the scientific reasoning behind this method of face-to-face daytime speed dating, which was in large ignored. Instead, they used choice sentences to turn up the controversy in order to create a story and demonise an innocent man. The police didn\u2019t act because of online videos, they were aware of them for years, they crumbled because of media pressure because Police Scotland is a Mickey Mouse force of hick villagers. \nIt\u2019s totally bizarre and shockingly worrying that a country\u2019s police force can\u2019t withstand pressure from online trolls and can be manipulated so easily by faceless crazies on the internet. Yes, Scotland is a very small country, but that does not excuse the stupid backward policing tactics used for this matter. There should never have been an arrest in the first place. The police were aware of Ahmed\u2019s dating business 3 years prior to BBC The Social\u2019s hate fuelled video falsely demonising him. They spoke to Mr Ahmed about it on a number of occasions in casual conversation. Both male and female officers approved of it. There are phone calls and written police reports to confirm this. \nPolice Scotland are supposed to investigate matters neutrally and without prejudice. Instead they contributed to the media mayhem by making comments defaming a man who is \u201dnot guilty\u201d of an actual crime, but was charged, indicted and remanded regardless. The police tried to fish for a conviction to cover their mistakes and to not face legal action themselves. \nThe sour-pussed suckers at thenation.org.uk lied more; \u201cBBC investigation into his activities revealed he was part of global network of PUAs who practice game.\u201d Shut up, you idiots, that\u2019s fake news, again Ahmed. always stated I am not a PUA, I\u2019m a life coach! The clowns at thenation.org.uk stated; \u201cYouTube removed hundreds of videos and deactivated 2 channels run by Addy Agame and Street Attraction.\u201d YouTube removed videos because of pressure from the BBC, in order to avoid bad publicity, not because these videos violated any YouTube rules on nudity or sexual conduct. Thousands of these channels still exist and the dating businesses are still functioning. Ahmed\u2019s DWLF channel had been down since January 2019 through his own direction, not because it was deleted. None of Addy Agame\u2019s videos violated any of YouTube policies! \nThe fake news alarmists continued with more lies, stating; \u201coffered tips on last-minute resistance to sex. One clip included audio of a woman apparently recorded during sex.\u201d We have a quote from Adnan Ahmed aka Addy Agame\u2019s video about LMR on YouTube, Addy said; \u201cwe do not condone rape, never force yourself on anyone, hold yourself in high regard and allow space for women to come to you. If she leaves so be it, no means no, move onto someone who\u2019s into you, don\u2019t waste your time on time-wasters.\u201d \nThe video the slime balls refer to shows Ahmed saying; \u201cwe do not condone rape culture or forcing anyone sexually or otherwise, everything sexual is consented.\u201d Ahmed actually refers to \u201clast minute resistance\u201d as \u201cmaking women comfortable and creating the right mood for adult relations because too many guys either don\u2019t know what to do or are too thirsty to get laid and forget to have fun.\u201d \nThe cowards at thenation.org.uk continued; \u201cMr Ahmed also included audio apparently recorded during sex.\u201d Apparently, being the word, top reporting there you idiots! OK, so Addy had consensual sex with these women, some of which was adventurous where a couple filmed each other, again consensual, then it is used for a dating businesses YouTube channel \u2013 with all parties involved permitting it to be shown! Also, there is no actual pornographic video and the female participants\u2019 identity is protected because actual faces are not shown. Adnan Ahmed even commented on the consented video content in a statement to the BBC Social in November 2018 which was ignored in order to make a video defaming him and not showing his actual views, here is a link to what Addy actually said to the press. http://redpillrights.com/bbc-social-reporter-myles-bonnar-set-up-adnan-ahmed-a-k-a-addy-agame/. \nThe half-wit hack continued; \u201cboasting of having sex with women hours after having first met them.\u201d Typical feminazi whining crap. Anything a man says is \u201cmisogynistic,\u201d would it be better if he rambled feminazi monologues full of fake virtue signalling social justice drivel like you, to spare your paper-thin feelings?! Bugger off you little Hitler. Are you jealous he could back up what he taught, you label it \u201cbrag about his sex-life,\u201d is it because you\u2019re so toxic, you have no sex-life? Is free speech not allowed in feminazi-land? Not for men, especially ethnic men? Is that what you\u2019re saying? Here\u2019s a link to a video that shows what Addy said on YouTube about women, there is nothing \u201cmisogynistic\u201d about it (do your research!) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAVX4XHhCTk \nThe geeky hack fan-boy stated; \u201cclaiming he wanted to teach other men how to pick-up women.\u201d Looks like you could use the help, you seem like a run of the mill simp with bad posture and low confidence! What dating coaches like Addy taught clumsy social misfits is that they can learn to perceive things differently, to cut through illusions of the mind / PC society that they believe or fear, to stop seeing imaginary problems and to learn to focus on the reality of male-female dynamics. Too often clients who think like Bonnar react emotionally, get despondent and lose perspective. Their negative perceptions invade their minds and throw off their emotional compass, resulting in social anxiety. Dating is taught as a science and an art. Human brains evolved for an environment very different from the one we currently inhabit, resulting in people carrying biological baggage (as social justice ideologies clash with basic human instincts). Humans are still primed to detect threats / dangers that no longer exist, ie. stress of\u00a0 rejection or the fight-or-flight response experienced when talking to a female. Addy taught that men have a choice in how they respond to this situation; to not be led by primal feelings, to understand them and learn how to filer them in order to be attractive to the opposite sex (its not trickery, it\u2019s science and art). This hack truly doesn\u2019t get it and this, along with his bitterness led to his hate-campaign and sexually jealous lies about men who he perceives as superior. \nThe bitter hack hates men who have honed the ability to control, channel and understand primal signals because they can\u2019t access that part of themselves; They are a slave to their impulses, instincts, social justice conditioning and need for approval \u2013 they\u2019ve never even questioned why they are the way they are! If the BBC Social video or Panorama / Disclosure flop-umentary were even slightly accurate; they would have shown how Addy turned seduction into an education, skill-set and success with women. Many men from all backgrounds testify online on how they learned to control emotions, to have a positive outlook, to overcome anxiety / depression, to enjoy the present moment and to handle situations that disturb / limit others. Women benefit from this also, they can have healthy relationships (whether short-term or long-term) with men who have their sh*t together! Instead you falsely reported what your dark sordid agenda and limited mind made-up and twisted! \nAddy taught his clients a series of exposure therapy exercises in varying levels of difficulty; from simple daunting approaches, until they did it so many times that it became as second nature as breathing. Making it natural and familiar, removing uncertainty, leading to confidence through experience. Fear is relieved by authority. Training is authority, it\u2019s a release valve. With enough exposure, ordinary and innate fears are ironed out. Unfamiliarity is eliminated, which in turn increases tolerance to stress / anxiety / uncertainty. thenation.org.yk should apply this to areas of their life, they might learn something more valuable than their egoistic armchair analysing! \nThe most important fact is justice was done and Adnan Ahmed aka Addy Agame won his appeal to overturn the wrongful convictions and sentence due to a miscarriage of justice and no actual crime to answer to in September 2020!\u00a0 \nThe post Fraudsters At Pakistani Scam Site \u201cthenation.org.uk\u201d Spam Fake News Article From Vile Scottish Media About Innocent Man Adnan Ahmed Being Wrongfully Imprisoned For False Accusations Of Threatening Behaviour (Ahmed Was Proven Innocent And Cleared In The High Court) appeared first on red pill truth.",

                "title": "The Value of Everything: Adam Smith",
                "text": "This post is part of a series discussing value and economics. This post is quoted from the first chapter of The Value of Everything by Mariana Mazzucato. There is no original discussion in this post, and any typos are mine. Born in 1723 into a family of customs officials in Kirkcaldy, in the county of Fife, Scotland, Adam Smith became Professor of Moral Philosophy at the University of Glasgow before turning his mind to what we now call economic questions, although at the time such questions were deeply influenced by philosophy and political thought. With Britain well on the path to industrial capitalism, Smith's The Wealth of Nations highlighted the role of the division of labor in manufacturing. His account of pin-manufacturing continues to be cited today as one of the first examples of organizational and technological change at the center of the economic growth process. Explaining the immense increase in productivity that occurred when one worker was no longer responsible for producing an entire pin, but only for a small part of it, Smith related how the division of labor allowed an increase in specialization and hence productivity: I have seen a small manufactory of this kind where ten men only were employed, and where some of them consequently performed two or three distinct operations. But though they were very poor, and therefore but indifferently accommodated with the necessary machinery, they could, when the exerted themselves, make among them about 12 pounds of pins in a day. There are in a pound upwards of 4,000 pins of a middling size. Those ten persons, therefore, could make among them upwards of 48,000 pins in a day. Each person, therefore, making a tenth part of 48,000 pins, might be considered as making 4,800 pins in a day. But if they had all wrought separately and independently, and without any of them having been educated to this peculiar business, they certainly could not each of them have made 20, perhaps not one pin in a day; that is, certainly, not the 240th, perhaps not the 4,800th part of what they are at present capable of performing, in consequence of a proper division and combination of their different operations.These insights were original and profound. Smith was writing while the Industrial Revolution introduced machines into factories on a large scale. Then harnessed to the division of labor, mechanization would radically increase productivity\u2013 the principal engine of economic growth. But even the simple reorganization of labor, without machinery, by which each worker specialized and developed skills in a specific area, enabled Smith to make this critical point. Equally significant was Smith's analysis of how the 'market' determines the way in which consumers and producers interact. Such interaction, he contended, was now down to 'benevolence' or central planning. Rather, it was due to the 'invisible hand' of the market: Every individual is continually exerting himself to find out the most advantageous employment for whatever capital he can command. It is his own advantage, indeed, and not that of the society which he has in view. But the study of his own advantage naturally, or rather necessarily, leads him to prefer that employment which is most advantageous to society... He intends only his own gain, and his is in this, as in many other cases, led by an invisible hand to promote an end which was not part of his intention.Like Quesnay, Smith launched a more general attack on mercantilist policies which, he argued, restricted competition and trade. He also argued strongly for policies that would increase savings, and hence the amount of capital available for investment rather than unproductive consumption (say, on luxuries). But for Smith, industrial workers\u2013 not, as for Quesnay, farmers\u2013 were at the heart of the productive economy. Manufacturing labor, not land, was the source of value. The labor theory of value was born. Smith has become the figurehead of much modern economic theory because of his ideas about how capitalism is founded on supposedly immutable human behavior, notably self-interest, and competition in a market economy. His metaphor of the 'invisible hand' has been cited ad nauseam to support the current orthodoxy that markets, left to themselves, may lead to a socially optimal outcome\u2013 indeed, more beneficial than if the state intervenes. Smith's book is actually a collection of recipes for politicians and policymakers. Far from leaving everything to the market, he thinks of himself as giving guidance to 'statesmen' on how to act to 'enrich both the people and the sovereign'\u2013 how to increase the wealth of nations. This is where Smith's value theory enters the picture. He was convinced that growth depended on increasing the relative share of 'manufactuers'\u2013 factories employing formerly independent artisans or agricultural workers as dependent wage laborers\u2013 in the overall make-up of industry and believed that free trade was essential to bring this about. He felt that the enemies of growth were, first, the protectionist policies of mercantilists; second, the guilds protecting artisans' privileges; and third, a nobility that squandered its money on unproductive labor and lavish consumption. For Smith (as for Quesnay), employing an overly large portion of labor for unproductive purposes\u2013 such as the hoarding of cash, a practice that still afflicts our modern economies\u2013 prevents a nation from accumulating wealth.  Value, Smith believed, was proportional to the time spent by workers on production. For the purposes of his theory, Smith assumed a worker of average speed. Figure 5 shows how he drew a clear line (the production boundary) between productive and unproductive labor. For him, the boundary lay between material production\u2013 agriculture, manufacturing, mining in the figure's darker blob\u2013 and immaterial production in the lighter blob. The latter included all types of services (lawyers, carters, officials and so on) that were useful to manufacturers, but were not actually involved in production itself. Smith said as much: labor, he suggested, is productive when it is 'realized' in a permanent object. His positioning of government on the 'unproductive' side of the boundary set the tone for much subsequent analysis and is a recurring theme in today's debates about government's role in the economy, epitomized by the Thatcher-Reagan reassertion in the 1980s of the primacy of markets in solving economic and social issues. Figure 5: The production boundary according to Adam SmithIn Smith's view, 'how honorable, how useful, or how necessary soever' a service may be, it simply does not reproduce the value used in maintaining (feeding, clothing, housing) unproductive laborers. Smith finds that even 'the sovereign', together with 'all the officers both of justice and war who serve under him, the whole army and navy, are unproductive laborers'. Priests, lawyers, doctors and performing artists are all lumped together as unproductive too. What informs Smith's classification is his conviction that some types of labor do not 'reproduce' the value needed to keep those workers alive at a subsistence level. In other words, if all the subsistence that was needed to keep a person alive was a certain amount of grain, then anyone who does not produce as much value as that amount of grain is by definition unproductive. How, then, are those that do not produce this unit of value kept alive? Smith's answer lay in the concept of a 'surplus'. Many productive workers produce the equivalent of more grain than they need to feed themselves to survive. A manufacturer makes things that, when exchanged, will yield more grain than needed to keep the productive workers alive. The surplus then sustains unproductive laborers, including the entourages of aristocrats, who kept 'a profuse and sumptuous table' with 'a great number of menial servants, and a multitude of dogs and horses'. This is where Smith addressed head-on how the wealth of nations could grow. It was in effect his policy advice. Instead of 'wasting' the surplus on paying for unproductive labor, he argued, it should be saved and invested in more production so that the whole nation could become richer. Smith was not criticizing the wealthy per se. But he was criticizing those who wasted their wealth on lavish consumption\u2013 'collecting books, statues, pictures', or 'more frivolous, jewels, baubles, ingenious trinkets'\u2013 instead of productive investment. (This, after all, was the age of the Grand Tour, when young aristocrats traveled to the Continent to improve their education and returned laden with ancient artifacts.) Smith was particularly attracted to the prospect of investment in machines, then just beginning to be used in factories, because they improved workers' productivity. His emphasis on investment linked directly to his ideas about rent. Smith believed that there were three kinds of income: wages for labor in capitalist enterprises; profits for capitalists who owned the means of production; and rents from ownership of land. When these three sources of income are paid at their competitive level, together they determine what he called the 'competitive price'. Since land was necessary, rent from land was a 'natural' part of the economy. But that did not mean rent was productive: 'the landlords, like all other men, love to reap where they never sowed and demand a rent [from the earth] even for its natural produce'. Indeed, Smith asserted, the principle of rent from land could be extended to other monopolies, such as the right to import a particular commodity or the right to plead at the bar. Smith was well aware of the damage monopolies could do. In the 17th century, a government desperate for revenue had granted\u2013 often to well-placed courtiers\u2013 an extraordinary range of monopolies, from daily necessities such as beer and salt to mousetraps and spectacles. In 1621 there were said to be 700 monopolies, and by the late 1630s they were bringing in 100,000 pounds a year to the Exchequer. But this epidemic of rent-seeking was deeply unpopular and was choking the economy: more than that, it was one of the proximate causes of the Civil War, which led to the execution of Charles I. Many Englishmen understood what Smith meant when he said that a free market was one free of rent. Smith's penetrating analysis of how advanced capitalist economies functioned won him many followers. Equally, his staunch advocacy of free trade, in an era in which mercentilist policies were beginning to be seen as old-fashioned (Smith, indeed, believed that merchants were unproductive because they only provided the ephemeral service of moving goods around, rather than producing anything of value), made his book a hit among the 'free traders' who eventually overturned England's Corn Laws, which imposed heavy tariffs on imported corn to protect domestic landowners, and other protectionist measures. Armed with Smith's ideas, free traders showed that nations could get richer even if there was no trade surplus and no gold accumulation. Amassing gold was unnecessary and insufficient for growth. Huge amounts of gold flower to Spain from its colonies, but the kingdom did not become more productive. The victory of the free traders over the mercantilists is better understood in terms of their rival conceptions of value. Mercantilists thought gold had inherent worth and that everything else could be valued in terms of how much gold it was exchanged for. Following Smith, free traders could trace value to labor, and the logic of value was thereby inverted. Gold, like all other things, was valued by how much labor it took to produce. Smith's theory was not immune to criticism. He had actually put forward at least two theories of value, which created confusion about both the production boundary and precisely who was productive\u2013 in particular, whether the provision of services in themselves created value. In essence, Smith was confused about the distinction between material and immaterial production. For Smith, as we have seen, a servant 'adds' no value that could be used by the master on something other than, literally, keeping the servant alive. But he also argued that if a manufacturing worker ears $1 in turning a quantity of cotton, whose other inputs also cost $1, into a piece of cloth that sells for $3, then the worker will have repaid his service and the master has made a profit of $1. Here a definition of productivity irrespective of whether what is produced is a solid product or a service, emerges. Adding value in any branch of production is productive; not adding value is unproductive. Following this definition, services such as cleaning or vehicle repair can be productive\u2013 thereby invalidating Smith's own material-immaterial division of the production boundary. The debates about Smith's theories of value rumbled on for centuries. Other of Smith's ideas, such as free trade and the unproductive nature of government, have also left an enduring legacy. But he is often misconstrued. His understanding of politics and philosophy was never sidelined in his economic reasoning. His Theory of Moral Sentiments and The Wealth of Nations were not contradictory but part of his deep analysis of what drives human behavior and how societies organize themselves, and why some societies might grow in wealth more than others. Smith's analysis of 'free markets' was closely tied to his understanding of production, and the need to limit rent-seeking behavior.",

I knew exactly what he\u2019d been accused of. \n\nThe fact is the facts alone didn\u2019t matter because I\u2019d already made up my mind about him. My fellow Vassar students\u2014all liberals, of course\u2014pressed me to recant. But the more they did, the more feverish I became in my defense. I didn\u2019t want to admit I was wrong (who does?) so I dreamed up reasons to show I wasn\u2019t\u2014a classic example of cognitive dissonance in action.\u00a0 \n\nA pioneering study by social psychologist Elliot Aronson conducted in the 1950s helps explain my mental gymnastics. Young college women invited to attend a risqu\u00e9 discussion of sexuality were divided into two groups. One group was put through a preliminary ritual in which they had to read aloud a list of words like \u201cprostitute,\u201d \u201cvirgin,\u201d and \u201cpetting.\u201d The other group had to say out loud a dozen obscenities including the word \u201cfuck.\u201d Afterwards, the members of both groups were required to attend a discussion on sex, which is what had been the draw. But it turned out they had all been duped. The discussion wasn\u2019t risqu\u00e9. The subject turned out to be lower-order animal sexuality. Worse, the people leading the discussion spoke in a monotone voice so low it was hard to follow what they were saying.\u00a0 \n\nFollowing the exercise the students were asked to comment on what they had been through. You might expect the students who went through the embarrassing rite of speaking obscenities to complain the loudest about the ordeal. But that isn\u2019t what happened. Rather, they were more likely to speak positively about the experience. \n\nThe theory of cognitive dissonance explains why. While all of the subjects in the experiment felt unease at being duped, those for whom the experience was truly onerous felt a more compelling need to explain away their decision to take part. The solution was to reimagine what had happened. By rewriting history they could tell themselves that what had appeared to be a bad experience was actually a good one. Dissonance begone. \n\nThis is what I did each time one of my Vassar friends pointed to facts that showed Nixon was lying.\u00a0 \n\nNeuroscience\u00a0experiments\u00a0in the 21st century by Drew Westen show what happens in our brain when we confront information at odds with our commitments. In one study, supporters of President George W. Bush were given information that suggested he had been guilty of hypocrisy. Instead of grappling with the contradiction they ignored it. Most disturbing of all, this happened out of conscious awareness. MRI pictures showed that when they learned of Bush\u2019s hypocrisy, their brains automatically shut off the \u201cspigot of unpleasant emotion.\u201d (It\u2019s not a uniquely Republican trait; the same thing happened with supporters of John Kerry.)\u00a0 \n\nIn short, human beings want to be right and we want our team to win. But we knew all that, right? Anybody who\u2019s taken a Psych 101 class knows about confirmation bias: that humans seek out information that substantiates what they already believe; and bounded rationality: that human reason is limited to the information sources to which we are exposed; and motivated reasoning: that humans have a hard time being objective.\u00a0 \n\nBut knowing all this isn\u2019t enough to understand why Trump voters are sticking with Trump. \n\nWhat\u2019s required instead is a comprehensive way to think about the stubbornness of public opinion and when it changes. Until a few decades ago no one had much of a clue what a comprehensive approach might look like. All people had to go on was speculation. Then scientists operating in three different realms \u2014 social psychology, neuroscience, and political science \u2014 began to delve into the working of the human brain. What they wanted to know was how we learn. The answer, most agreed, was that the brain works on a dual-process system, a finding popularized by Daniel Kahneman, the Nobel prize-winning Princeton psychologist, in the book,\u00a0Thinking Fast and Slow. \n\nOne track, which came to be known as System 1, is super-fast and happens out of conscious awareness, the thinking you do without thinking. \n\nThere are two components to System 1 thinking. One involves what popularly is thought of as our animal instincts, or what social scientists refer to, with more precision, as evolved psychological mechanisms. Example: the universal human fear of snakes. The other involves ways of thinking shaped by habit. The more you perform a certain task, the more familiar it becomes and the better you get at it without having to think about it. \n\nDonald Trump likes to say that he goes with his gut. What he\u2019s saying, likely without knowing it, is that he has confidence in his System 1. This is not exceptional. Most of us trust our instincts most of the time. What\u00a0distinguishes\u00a0Trump\u00a0is that he seems to privilege instinct over reason nearly all of the time. \n\nThe second track, System 2, is slower and allows for reflection. This mode, which involves higher-order cognitive thinking, kicks in automatically when our brain\u2019s surveillance system detects a novel situation for which we aren\u2019t prepared by experience. At that moment we shift from unconscious reaction to conscious thinking. It is System 2 that we rely on when mulling over a difficult question involving multiple variables. Because our brain is in a sense lazy, as Kahneman notes, and System 2 thinking is hard, our default is System 1 thinking. \n\nOne thing that\u2019s worth noting about System 1 thinking is that our brains are essentially conservative. While humans are naturally curious about the world and we are constantly growing our knowledge by, in effect, adding books to the shelves that exist in our mind\u2019s library, only reluctantly do we decide to expand the library by adding a new shelf. And only very rarely do we think to change the system by which we organize the books on those shelves. Once we settle on the equivalent of the Dewey Decimal System in our mind, it\u2019s very hard to switch to another system. This is one of the main reasons why people are almost always reluctant to embrace change. It\u2019s why inertia wins out time and time again. \n\nBut change we do, thanks to System 2. But what exactly triggers System 2 when it\u2019s our politics that are on the line? Social scientists finally came up with a convincing explanation when they began studying the effect of emotion on political decision-making in the 1980s. \n\nOne of the pioneers in this research is George Marcus. When Marcus was starting out as a political scientist at Williams College he began to argue that the profession should be focusing more on emotion, something they\u2019d never done, mainly because emotion is hard to quantify and count and political scientists like to count things. When Marcus began writing papers about emotion he found he couldn\u2019t find editors who would publish them.\u00a0 \n\nBut it turned out his timing was perfect. Just as he was beginning to focus on emotion so were neuroscientists like Antonio Damasio. What the neuroscientists were learning was that the ancient belief that emotion is the enemy of reason is all wrong. Rather, emotion is the handmaiden of reason. What Damasio discovered was that patients with a damaged amygdala, the seat of many emotions, could not make decisions. He\u00a0concluded: The \u201cabsence of emotion appears to be at least as pernicious for rationality as excessive emotion.\u201d\u00a0 \n\nIf emotion is critical to reason, the obvious question became: which emotion triggers fresh thinking? Eventually Marcus and a handful of other political scientists who shared his assumption that emotion is important to decision making became convinced that the one that triggers reappraisals is anxiety. Why anxiety? Because it turned out that when people realize that the picture of the world in their brain doesn\u2019t match the world as it actually exists, their amygdala registers a strong reaction. This is felt in the body as anxiety. \n\nEventually, Marcus and his colleagues came up with a theory that helps us understand when people change their minds. It became known as the Theory of Affective Intelligence (later: the Theory of Affective Agency). The theory is straightforward: The more anxiety we feel the more likely we are to reconsider our beliefs. We actually change our beliefs when, as Marcus phrases it, the burden of hanging onto an opinion becomes greater than the cost of changing it. Experiments\u00a0show\u00a0that when people grow anxious they suddenly become open to new information. They follow hyperlinks promising fresh takes and they think about the new facts they encounter. \n\nHow does this help us understand Trump supporters? It doesn\u2019t, if you accept the endless assertions that Trump voters are gripped by fear and economic anxiety. In that case, they should be particularly open to change. And yet they\u2019re as stuck on Trump as I was on Nixon. \n\nThe problem isn\u2019t with the theory. It\u2019s with the fear and anxiety diagnosis.\u00a0 \n\nHumans can multiple feelings at odds with one another simultaneously, but research shows that only one emotion is likely to affect their politics. The dominant emotion characterizing so-called populist voters like those attracted to Trump is\u00a0anger, not fear. This has been found in studies of populists in\u00a0France,\u00a0Spain,\u00a0Germany\u00a0and\u00a0Britain\u00a0as well as the\u00a0United States.\u00a0 \n\nIf the researchers are right that populists are mostly angry, not anxious, their remarkable stubbornness immediately becomes explicable. One of the\u00a0findings\u00a0of social scientists who study anger is that it makes people close-minded. After reading an article that expresses a view contrary to their own, people decline to follow links to find out more information. The angrier you become, the less likely you are to welcome alternative points of view.\u00a0 \n\nThat\u2019s a powerful motive for ignoring Trump\u2019s thousands of naked lies. \n\nWhy did I finally abandon Nixon? For months and months I had been angry over Watergate. Not angry at Nixon, as you might imagine, but angry at the liberals for beating up on him. Nixon fed this anger with repeated attacks on the people he perceived as his enemies. As long as I shared his anger I wasn\u2019t prepared to reconsider my commitment to his cause.\u00a0 \n\nBut eventually there came a point when I stopped being angry and became anxious.\u00a0 \n\nI would guess that what happened is that over time Nixon\u2019s attacks came to seem shopworn and thin. Defending him became more of a burden than the cost of abandoning him. \n\nIf I am right about the circuitous path I took from Nixon supporter to Nixon-basher, there\u2019s hope that Trump supporters will have their own Road to Damascus epiphany. Like me, they may finally tire of anger, though who knows. Right-wing talk radio and Fox News have been peddling anger for years and the audience still loves it. \n\nIt took me 711 days from the time of the Watergate burglary to my break with Nixon, when I resigned from a committee defending him, to come to my senses. As this is published, it has been 812 days since Trump became president. And there\u2019s little indication that Trump voters have reached an inflection point. \n\nAny of a number of disclosures could disillusion a substantial number of them. We have yet to read the full Mueller report. Nor have we yet seen Trump\u2019s tax returns, which might prove politically fatal if they show he isn\u2019t really a billionaire or if they prove his companies depended on Russian money. (As Mitt Romney\u00a0suggested, the returns likely contain a bombshell.)\u00a0 \n\nIf Trump\u2019s disclosures suggest to his supporters that they were chumps to believe in him his popularity no doubt would begin eroding. And already there\u2019s evidence his support has weakened. In January 51 percent of GOP or GOP-leaning voters said they\u00a0considered\u00a0themselves more a supporter of Donald Trump than the Republican Party. \u00a0Two months later the number had declined to 43 percent. If this slippage is because more supporters feel they are embarrassed to come out as full-blown Trumpies he may be in trouble come election day. \n\nIn the end, politics is always about the voters. Until now, Trump has made his voters by and large feel good about themselves by validating their anger. But there remains the possibility that in the coming months disclosures may make them feel that they have been conned, severely testing their loyalty. If the anger they feel either wears off or is redirected at Trump himself their amygdala should send them a signal indicating discomfort with the mismatch between the known facts and their own commitments. \n\nThis presupposes that they can get outside the Fox News and conservative talk bubble so many have been living inside. Who knows if they will. It is worth remembering that even in Nixon\u2019s day, millions remained wedded to his lost cause even after the release of the smoking-gun tape. On the day he resigned, August 9, 1974, 50 percent of Republicans still\u00a0supported\u00a0him even as his general approval dropped to 24 percent. \n\nTo sum up: Facts finally count if enough loyalists can get past their anger to see the facts for what they are. But people have to be exposed to the facts for this to occur. And we can\u2019t be sure that this time they will be.",

                "text": "Dear America, \n\n\n\nYou\u2019ve always been this way. We\u2019ve told you time and time again, and every time you chose to ignore it. \n\n\n\nFrom taking over land that wasn\u2019t yours to begin with, and systematically isolating the Native Americans at every turn, why are you shocked by your own actions? Instead of settling in peace and working alongside the Natives, you chose genocide to claim the land. You pushed them into reserves in their own country, and began to dictate to them where they can go, what they can do, and they must do it only with your permission. It\u2019s a shame, because if you ask me what America\u2019s original name was, i couldn\u2019t tell you. We know nothing of an important people as you never dared teach us about them, and fondly referred to them as savages, even though it was you who was savage. You took it so far as to ban them from practicing their own culture in their own land, and shed your own original identities to fit the place you now want to call home. You stole their crops, murdered their children, desecrated sacred soil, use their culture as Halloween costumes, and still have the gall to proclaim \u2018This is not America\u2018. But it is. And you\u2019ve always been this way. \n\n\n\nDid you forget slavery, and the fact you had a civil war over keeping people in bondage or setting them free? Actual human beings! People with feelings, family, and bleed red just like you and I. Do you remember the civil rights movement? That was only a couple of decades ago where in many states you proudly displayed \u2018No Blacks\u2019 and \u2018Only Whites\u2019 signs at supposed reputable establishments. Many of your grandparents remember those very well, and still uphold those values and pass them down generations, like passing bread down the dinner table during family Sunday dinner. You were happy to arrange lynchings and burn Black Wall Street down gleefully like attending a amusement park. You were happy to attempt blocking children from attending school with your kids, as if blackness could be caught and was a dangerous sin. You taught African-Americans that their history begins and ends with slavery, even though we all know this to be wrong. However, if we tried to have a conversation about it now, the first thing you would say is \u2018This is not America\u2018. But it is. And you\u2019ve always been this way. \n\n\n\nRemember women that you claim to love so much? But as always, oppression is your game, and you came to win it. You dictate to women when, where and what they can do that is only acceptable to you. Whether it be dress codes or autonomy over their own bodies, you still feel the need to be in control. You\u2019ve become the abusive ex that they just can\u2019t shake off, but claim you do it for their own good. How do you know what\u2019s good for them? Do you know what its like to birth children, have a period or simply want to exist in peace? Or have you forgotten the meaning of the word you so carelessly throw around like a new phrase in an office meeting? We always hear first female this, and first female that, like we don\u2019t know that women work hard just to be seen and heard. They work twice as hard to get into spaces that they belong in, and twice as hard to avoid being killed just for not being interested in someone giving unwanted attention. But as always that same phrase is ever waiting on the tip of your tongues. \u2018This is not America\u2018. But it is. And you\u2019ve always been this way. \n\n\n\nDo you remember that time in the sixties when you preached and practiced free love? Apparently now, only you can dictate who loves who. You may have brought in same sex marriage, but can it be done in all fifty states? Or is it not safe to? We\u2019re all wondering why that is. But I guess we already know the answer to that question. You seem to have an issue with people just living. You love to dictate to people how to be, how to walk, how to talk, how to breathe. Don\u2019t you get tired? Because we\u2019re tired of having to tiptoe around you while just trying to be upstanding people and not break the laws you\u2019ve set out in someone else\u2019s land. However, in your eyes we are all criminal because we don\u2019t love how you say we must love. But as a tale as old as time, you repeat \u2018This is not America\u2018. But it is. And you\u2019ve always been this way. \n\n\n\nOr did you forget the executive orders many of you celebrated grandiosely because it banned people from Muslim countries from entering your \u2018great nation\u2019? You partied at the idea of undocumented people being deported and separated from their children, though all they wanted was a better life. You barely batted an eyelid when it was discovered that many of those children were missing and couldn\u2019t be accounted for, and quietly stopped mentioning this failure. You sold the American dream and then told them it\u2019s only for Americans. Nevertheless, when something that\u2019s none of your concern, or any of your business happens abroad, you\u2019re the first to stand up and preach about human rights, and use that as an excuse to pillage another man\u2019s land in the name of democracy. All the while forgetting your own misdeeds. It\u2019s the same democracy you bring that turns the people overseas against you and you wonder why they wish to attack everything you hold dear. Which isn\u2019t much by the way. You\u2019re no better than Britain, Spain and France that conquered the world, and still questions why they aren\u2019t liked much. But its perfectly fine, because \u2018This is not America\u2018. But it is. And you\u2019ve always been this way. \n\n\n\nYou\u2019re the only country in the world that stockpiles guns and ammunition while shouting its your right, and then turn those same guns towards your own doors. Ironic really, isn\u2019t it? You were so afraid of everyone else, that you never considered once that maybe you should be afraid of your own. You war mongered for so long, that it became inevitable that you should become your own enemy. We all saw the downward spiral, but apparently you didn\u2019t. And if you did, you in no way took it seriously enough. You actually underestimated yourself. Too focused on terrorism overseas, you didn\u2019t realize that you had already been honing your own art of terrorism right at home. Consumed with preaching hate in your own walls, that you forgot your christian ideals at the door, and used that same supposed Christianity to paint the walls with fear among your residents. And now here you are, telling us to unify, and come together for healing and singing your favorite song; \u2018This is not America\u2018. Yes it is. And you\u2019ve always been this way. \n\n\n\nIts time for you to change your ways. Because we are sick of it. It\u2019s time to wake up and stop preaching hate while being a hypocrite to your own moral code. You can do better, and you know you can be better. So stop wasting time and finally step into the \u2018Leader of The Free World\u2019 role you so proudly like to flaunt to the rest. Otherwise, step aside and let someone else take that role for a change while you start to clean up the abysmal lodgings you call home. \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nSincerely, \n\n\n\nConcerned Humanitarian.",

We\u2019ve built a world with the mindset of maximizing \u201cme,\u201d creating catastrophic results that benefit no one. But what to do? As Albert Einstein observed, \u201cWe cannot solve problems with the same kind of thinking that created them.\u201d If we want to change the way the world works, we need to update the thinking that created the systems, institutions and economies around us. Otto Scharmer has developed a framework and strategies for guiding this shift in our thinking from an ego-centric awareness to an eco-centric one \u2014 from considering what\u2019s best for me to considering what\u2019s best for the whole, including me. Tune in to find out why embracing this shift is at the core of the leadership the world needs.\u201d At the link right-click \u201cDownload MP3\u201d and select \u201cSave Link As\u201d from the pop-up menu. \n\n\n\nAI and Criminal Justice 38 mins \u2013 \u201cAs technology becomes more sophisticated, artificial intelligence (AI) is permeating into new parts of society and being used in criminal justice to assess risks for those in pre-trial or on probation. Predictive analytics raise several questions concerning bias, accuracy, and fairness. Observers worry that these tools replicate injustice and lead to unfair outcomes in pre-trial hearings, detention, and incarceration. On February 19, Governance Studies at Brookings hosted an event to address the challenges of federal risk assessment instruments in the criminal justice system. Panelists discussed the implications of AI on criminal justice and ways to improve criminal justice reform initiatives.\u201d At the link you can listen, but not download; however,a copy is included in this blog archive. \u00a0 \n\n\n\nAI Principals 39 mins \u2013 \u201cThis virtual talk features Jessica Fjeld, assistant director of the Cyberlaw Clinic and lead author on the \u201cPrincipled AI\u201d report, in conversation with Ryan Budish, an assistant research director at Berkman Klein and a member of OECD\u2019s AI Governance Expert Group, which proposed high-level AI principles.

Despite the hype and excitement surrounding AI, Mitchell argues that much of what is called \u201clearning\u201d and \u201cintelligence\u201d when done by machines is not analogous to human capabilities. The capabilities of machines are highly limited to explicit, narrow tasks with little transfer to similar but different challenges.

Foreigners come looking for spiritual enlightenment or help with mental health problems like trauma, depression, and addiction. But not everyone is happy about Peru\u2019s booming ayahuasca tourism industry. A group of indigenous healers are fighting back against what they see as the exploitation and appropriation of their cultural heritage by foreigners \u2013 who run most of the ayahuasca retreats popular with tourists. This coming together of cultures has thrown up another serious problem too: vulnerable women being sexually abused while under the influence of charismatic healers and this powerful psychedelic.\u201d At the link left-click \u201cDownload,\u201d select \u201cLessor quality\u201d then \u201cSave File\u201d and \u201cOK\u201d to get the podcast. \n\n\n\nBrown Skinned 36 mins \u2013 \u201cIn a compelling conversation, acclaimed journalist and author Kamal Al-Solaylee discusses all things brown, from the psychology of the colour, to why he says, it\u2019s always \u2018a bridesmaid,\u00a0never the bride,\u2019 in the constructed hierarchy of human skin tone.\u201d At the link right-click \u201cPlay Episode\u201d to listen; a copy of the podcast is included in this blog archive. \n\n\n\nBlack Business Devaluation..83 mins.- \u201cIn 2018, research from the Brookings Metropolitan Policy Program (Brookings Metro) and Gallup showed that homes in Black-majority neighborhoods experience devaluation due to racial bias at a rate of 23% on average, when compared to similar homes in otherwise similar white neighborhoods. Now, in a related study, the authors offer evidence for the devaluation of businesses. The report, titled \u201cFive-star reviews, one-star profits: The devaluation of businesses in Black communities\u201d, finds that highly rated businesses in Black neighborhoods (measured by Yelp ratings) experience slower revenue growth than poorly rated businesses in otherwise similar neighborhoods. This unrealized growth results in a total devaluation of more than $1.3 billion in lost revenue annually.\u201d At the link you can listen, but not download; however,a copy is included in this blog archive. \u00a0 \n\n\n\nCaffeine Use 26 mins \u2013 \u201c\u2019Omnivore\u2019s Dilemma\u2019 author Michael Pollan talks about his audiobook, \u2018Caffeine: How Coffee and Tea Created the Modern World.\u2019 He describes caffeine as the world\u2019s most widely-used psychoactive drug.\u201d At the link you can listen, but not download; however, a copy of the podcast is included in this blog archive. \n\n\n\nChernoble Trends 13 mins \u2013 \u201dNinety year old Galina is one of the last witnesses to the wild natural world that preceded the Chernobyl zone in southern Belarus. \u2018We lived with wolves\u2019 she says \u2018and moose, and elk and wild boars.\u2019 Soviet development destroyed that ecosystem. Forests and marshland were tamed and laid to farmland and industrial use. But when the Chernobyl reactor exploded in 1986, the human population was evacuated; their villages were buried beneath the earth as though they had never existed. A generation on, it seems that the animals Galina knew are returning. But how are they are affected by their radioactive environment? And what can we infer about the state of the land?

We disagree politely but profoundly. I make the case that international law is distinct from what works in cyberspace and is inconsistent with either clarity or effectiveness in deterring cyberattacks. Harriet argues that international law has been a central principle of the post-1945 international system and one that has helped to keep a kind of peace among nations.

Benjamin Wittes spoke with Anne about the themes of the book: Why are all of these authoritarian ideologies on the rise now? What is the role of social media in their rise? What are the major themes that they have in common, and how different are they location by location? How did conservative ideology come to fracture the way it has over so brief a period of time?

After reporting on an internal DHS document and publishing other documents to Twitter, Wittes learned that I&A had distributed intelligence reports about those tweets along with the tweets of New York Times reporter Mike Baker. After Shane Harris reported on I&A\u2019s activities at the Washington Post, DHS announced that it was halting the practice of collecting information on journalists and the head of the office was reassigned.

Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed, who just last year won the Nobel Peace Prize for his efforts to bring unity between Ethiopia and neighboring Eritrea, led a military battle against domestic forces in the northern Ethiopian region of Tigray. The fighting has caused the significant displacement of people living in the region and has involved reports of atrocities. In early December, the Prime Minister claimed victory, but concerns remain about how long tensions will endure\u2014or at least continue to simmer. It\u2019s a complicated situation with major implications for stability in the East Africa and Horn of Africa region. To break it all down, Jacob Schulz talked with two different experts. First, to get a sense of what\u2019s going on and how we got to this point, he spoke with Emmanuel Igunza, a reporter in East Africa for BBC News; then, he spoke with Beza Tesfaye, the director of research and learning for migration at Mercy Corps, about the humanitarian problems implicated by the crisis.\u201d At the link left-click the down-pointing arrow and select \u201cSafe File\u201d and \u201cOK\u201d from the pop-up menu. \n\n\n\nFauci Discussion 27 mins \u2013 \u201cPresident Trump\u2019s daily briefings on the COVID-19 pandemic have introduced millions of Americans to Dr. Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. At times, the specialist in infectious diseases has differed with the president during the briefings, correcting him on the seriousness of the virus or on the timeline for developing a vaccine. That\u2019s fueled speculation that Fauci\u2019s tenure might be cut short. But New Yorker writer Michael Specter doesn\u2019t think Fauci needs to worry about job security. \u201cTrump can\u2019t fire him,\u201d Specter says. \u201cHe can kick him off the coronavirus task force \u2026 but he can\u2019t fire him from his job.\u201d Specter has known Fauci for decades \u2014 covering his work and the way he\u2019s handled the role of presidential adviser through six different U.S. presidents and the AIDS epidemic.

So often when we hear news of a significant development in genomics, we reflexively ask: \u201cShouldn\u2019t there be a law against that?\u201d Bartha Knoppers, professor and director of the Centre of Genomics and Policy at McGill University, is all too familiar with this response. She refers to it as the \u2018prohibition reflex\u2019. She says it may be natural, but it isn\u2019t necessarily helpful.

They talked about why the Israelis would conduct this operation, how effective its killing of Iranian nuclear scientists has been, whether any of it is legal and what it means for the future of U.S.-Iran relations.\u201d At the link left-click the down-pointing arrow and select \u201cSafe File\u201d and \u201cOK\u201d from the pop-up menu. \n\n\n\nISIS in America 36 mins \u2013 \u201cThe Islamic State in America is a topic that once garnered front-page headlines, but it has fallen a bit out of public attention in the past year or so. Jacob Schulz sat down with Seamus Hughes, the author with Alexander Meleagrou-Hitchens and Bennett Clifford of \u201cHomegrown: ISIS in America.\u201d They talked about the book, how the Islamic State has attracted American followers, how the organization operates differently in the U.S. versus Europe, the FBI and the role it plays in countering homegrown extremism, and what Seamus is most concerned about going forward.\u201d At the link left-click the down-pointing arrow and select \u201cSafe File\u201d and \u201cOK\u201d from the pop-up menu. \n\n\n\nLonger Life 38 mins \u2013 \u201cToday, the average person in the United States lives nearly ten years longer than he or she would have 50 years ago. What does that extra decade at the end of life look like? What are the implications of a longer life span on families, the health care system, retirement planning, government benefits and more? Now that retirement lasts not just a few years but is a whole new life phase extending a decade or two (or three!), how should middle-aged adults prepare for this era of life? Companies, government agencies and individuals are making changes to adjust but there\u2019s more work to do to ensure that seniors live healthier, more enriching lives than in the past.

The term \u201cgenomics\u201d hadn\u2019t yet been coined, the tools and technologies that are the foundation of modern biotechnology were in their infancy, and methods for sequencing even a few nucleotides were barely workable.1\u201d At the link right-click \u201cDownload\u201d and select \u201cSave Link As\u201d from the pop-up menu. \n\n\n\nNazism 33 mins \u2013 \u201cThis year, 2020, sees the 75th anniversary of the end of World War Two. Its legacy remains. Nowhere more so than in Germany, where the rise of Nazism led to the war, and terrible crimes against humanity. Chris Bowlby explores how post-war Germans have faced this inheritance and discovers how a search for justice in relation to Nazi crimes has continued, despite heavy pressure to stop. Alongside that, a powerful culture of remembrance has emerged, as each new generation makes its reckoning with the past. We meet the little-known small team of Nazi crime investigators, working discreetly behind walled premises in Ludwigsburg in Southern Germany. They used to carry guns for self-protection, such was hostility to their work. Through their research they have identified more than 28,000 Nazi crime scenes. But soon those who lived through the Nazi period will all be dead. What difference will it make when there are no more victims alive to tell their stories, no more prosecutions or trials? Will this history still be remembered and understood? And we hear from a new, young and diverse generation of Germans what they think about their country\u2019s Nazi past.\u201d At the link you can listen, but not download; however, a copy is included in this blog archive.. \n\n\n\nPlanning Your Post Retirement 10 mins \u2013 \u201cMarc Freedman, founder and CEO of Civic Ventures and author of \u201cThe Big Shift: Navigating the New Stage Beyond Midlife.\u201d Retiring to go play golf in Florida isn\u2019t the draw it used to be. In a 2014 Bank of America Merrill Lynch survey, 72% of employees over age 50 reported that they\u2019d like to continue working in retirement.\u00a0Partly that\u2019s a response to the Great Recession and a need to compensate for diminished savings; a Conference Board study showed that in the past eight years, nearly two-thirds of 45-60 year-olds experienced a 20% or greater decline in their assets.\u201d At the link right-click \u201cPlay Episode\u201d to listen; a copy of the podcast is included in this blog archive. \n\n\n\nPoisoning of Alexeia Navalny 22 mins \u2013 \u201cAlexei Navalny is Russia\u2019s most prominent dissident, opposition leader and anti-corruption crusader\u2014and the latest such person to be poisoned by the Vladimir Putin regime, which, of course, it denies. When we recorded this episode, Navalny\u2019s condition was improving as he received medical treatment in Germany. To discuss Navalny\u2019s career and why Putin chose now to attack him, Benjamin Wittes sat down with Alina Polyakova, president and CEO of the Center for European Policy Analysis. They talked about how Navalny has become such a thorn in the side of the Putin regime, why Putin keeps poisoning people as opposed to killing them by other means and why the Russians are so ineffective at poisonings when they undertake them.\u201d At the link left-click the down-pointing arrow and select \u201cSafe File\u201d and \u201cOK\u201d from the pop-up menu. \n\n\n\nPresident and COVID Infection 32 mins \u2013 \u201cPresident Trump is at Walter Reed with the COVID virus. A large number of executive and legislative branch officials have also tested positive. What happens when the president is seriously ill? What happens when the president is incapacitated? And what happens when a presidential candidate falls seriously ill\u2014after people have already started voting? These are not all questions entirely answered by the law, but they are all questions on which the law has something to say.

Writing at NBCNews.com, they report on disinformation and misinformation in health and politics. Their work covers a lot of ground, but for this episode, they discussed one increasingly prominent issue on that beat: QAnon, a conspiracy theory built around anonymous posts on an internet forum claiming that Donald Trump is waging war against a deep state and a vast network of child sex traffickers. The conspiracy theory has inspired acts of violence and is becoming increasingly mainstream, with several candidates for U.S. Congress being QAnon believers. They talked about how QAnon started, why we need to take it seriously and how the internet\u2014and big technology platformpops\u2014have allowed the theory to spread.\u201d At the link left-click the down-pointing arrow and select \u201cSafe File\u201d and \u201cOK\u201d from the pop-up menu. \n\n\n\nRetaining Talented Women 12 mins \u2013 \u201cHello, and welcome to the HBR IdeaCast from Harvard Business Online.

No less than 5 presidential candidates have released plans to connect the country\u2019s rural places, and the FCC has recently announced a $20billion funding program for fixed broadband and a $9billion program for 5G deployment in rural America. Despite these initiatives and interests, however, rural America remains woefully disconnected from a digital world that the urban and wealthy take for granted. Worse yet, the digital divide is growing, not shrinking despite billions of dollars of yearly investment and dozens of legislative proposals. This talk explains the policies that help and hinder broadband deployment in rural America. Christopher Ali argues that our current policy architecture grossly over-privileges incumbent telephone companies and systematically discourages new entrants from offering broadband, and demonstrates how the largest telecommunication companies have an economic incentive to keep the digital divide alive.\u201d At the link you can listen,but not download; however, a copy of the podcast is included in this blog archive. \n\n\n\nSecondhand Goods 46 mins \u2013 \u201cJournalist and author Adam Minter talks about his book Secondhand with EconTalk host Russ Roberts.

To talk about how they do it across the pond, David Kris sat down with two experts on UK SIGINT and SIGINT regulation: Michael Drury and Tony Comer, both veterans of Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ), the British counterpart to the U.S.\u2019s National Security Agency. Michael was GCHQ\u2019s first full-time legal advisor from 1996 to 2010, when he joined the private sector, and Tony was GCHQ\u2019s historian until his retirement earlier this year. They compared and contrasted the U.S. and UK experience with SIGINT, SIGINT regulation, popular support for SIGINT and intelligence in general, and also some cutting-edge issues, including how SIGINT works today, synergies between SIGINT and cyber, GDPR encryption and online harms.\u201d At the link left-click the down-pointing arrow and select \u201cSafe File\u201d and \u201cOK\u201d from the pop-up menu. \n\n\n\nSocial Media Weaponization 38 mins \u2013 \u201cOn this episode of Lawfare\u2019s Arbiters of Truth series on disinformation, Evelyn Douek spoke with Maria Ressa, a Filipino-American journalist and co-founder of Rappler, an online news site based in Manila. Maria was included in Time\u2019s Person of the Year in 2018 for her work combating fake news, and is currently fighting a conviction for \u201ccyberlibel\u201d in the Philippines for her role at Rappler. Maria and her fight are the subject of the film, \u201cA Thousand Cuts,\u201d released in virtual cinemas this summer and to be broadcast on PBS Frontline in early next year. As a country where Facebook is the internet, the Philippines was in a lot of ways ground zero for many of the same dynamics and exploitations of social media that are currently playing out around the world. What is the warning we need to take from Maria\u2019s experience and the experience of Philippine democracy? Why is the global south both the beta test and an afterthought for companies like Facebook?

To get at these questions, David Priess sat down with Chris Whipple, a documentary filmmaker, journalist and the author of two books about the people around the president. \u201cThe Gatekeepers,\u201d based upon his documentary of the same name, examines White House chiefs of staff, and his new book, \u201cThe Spymasters: How the CIA Directors Shape History and the Future,\u201d is based on the Showtime documentary \u201cThe Spymasters: CIA in the Crosshairs,\u201d for which Whipple was the writer and executive producer.

It concerns the Turkic minority known as the Uighurs whom the Chinese government has been rounding up and putting in reeducation camps. It is an ugly story\u2014one that the Chinese government has gone to great lengths to keep from international attention, with some degree of success. To walk us through the situation in Xinjiang, Benjamin Wittes spoke with Jessica Batke, a senior editor at ChinaFile; Darren Byler, a postdoctoral fellow at the University of Colorado at Boulder whose research focuses on Uighur dispossession; and Maya Wang, a senior China researcher for Human Rights Watch, who has written extensively on the use of biometrics, artificial intelligence and big data in mass surveillance in China.\u201d At the link left-click the down-pointing arrow and select \u201cSafe File\u201d and \u201cOK\u201d from the pop-up menu. \n\n\n\nUS in China 30 mins \u2013 \u201cJordan Schneider, the host of the ChinaTalk podcast, sat down with H.

First Draft recently released a report on the information environment around the development of vaccines for COVID-19, and Claire talked about what she and her team found in terms of online discussion of the vaccine in English, Spanish and French. What kinds of misinformation should we be ready for as vaccines begin to be administered across the world? Why might fact-checking and labeling by platforms not be effective in countering that misinformation?

But Benjamin Wittes sat down with him for a different reason\u2014his substantive expertise in Eastern Europe policy, Russia matters and great power competition. They talked about the challenges the Biden administration will face as it tries to pick up the pieces the Trump administration has left it, how democracies can hang together and harden themselves against attacks from authoritarian regimes, what a good Russia policy looks like, how China fits in and how we can rebuild traditional American alliances.\u201d At the link left-click the down-pointing arrow and select \u201cSafe File\u201d and \u201cOK\u201d from the pop-up menu. \n\n\n\nVindman Conversation 2 36 mins \u2013 \u201cFollowing his appearance on Friday on the Lawfare Podcast, Lieutenant Colonel Alexander Vindman, the Pritzker Military Fellow at the Lawfare Institute, appeared on Lawfare Live for a live video conversation and audience Q&A. It was a very good conversation\u2014so good that we thought we would bring you an edited version of it as Part Two of our conversation with Alex Vindman.

In the course of doing so, she made reference to a book by Kathleen Belew, a historian at the University of Chicago: \u201cBring the War Home: The White Power Movement and Paramilitary America,\u201d a history of violent white power movements in the modern United States. Elizabeth and Kathleen joined Benjamin Wittes to discuss the interactions of policy and the history that Belew describes. Why have we underestimated this threat for so long?

                "text": "Joseph de Weck \nImagine British political headlines in 30 years. Number 10 might declare victory on achieving carbon neutrality. Westminster might pass a universal minimum income to deal with mass unemployment due to automation. But almost certainly, the country won\u2019t be debating whether to rejoin the European Union. \nInstead, Labour and the Conservatives (or their future incarnations) will compete on who is the tougher negotiator with Brussels. Remainers will have become a relic of the past; the United Kingdom will be a country of Euroskeptics of different breeds. \nHow can we possibly know this? The answer is simple: by looking at Switzerland. \nFor the Swiss, the 2016 Brexit vote was a strange d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu. In 1992, 50.3 percent of the Swiss voted against joining the EU\u2019s single market. As a basis for their economic relationship with the EU, the Swiss were left with the classic free trade agreement they had negotiated with the bloc in 1972. \nUnder that agreement, the Swiss continued to enjoy tariff- and quota-free trade in industrial goods with the EU. But compared with their EU competitors, many Swiss exporters faced restricted access to EU markets along with red-tape costs and chronic legal uncertainty that limited their competitiveness. \nThe result? A decade of low growth. Looking for easier access to EU markets, Swiss exporters outsourced production facilities\u2014first to Germany and, later, to the EU\u2019s newer member states. A real estate bubble-turned-financial crisis dealt a further blow to the Swiss economy in the begging of the 1990s. \nAlthough difficult to imagine today, wealthy Switzerland was the worst-performing economy among countries in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) between 1992 and 2002. And this despite austerity-obsessed Bern trying to compensate the hit to the Swiss export economy by running fiscal deficits of up to 3 percent of GDP. \nThis is the not-so-rosy outlook the U.K. is facing now. The final Brexit deal is a free trade agreement that is only marginally more advanced than the Swiss deal from 1972. It is likely that the country\u2019s EU-facing exporters will, over the years, gradually move production and jobs to the continent. \nFor the U.K., the economic pain is likely to be even worse than it was for Switzerland in the 1990s. \nFor one, the deepening of the EU\u2019s single market since the 1990s has rendered the union more protectionist. Especially in financial services, the EU has massively advanced the harmonization of regulations across the continent and thereby shut out service providers from third countries, such as Switzerland and now the United Kingdom. \nSecond, Britain\u2019s economy is more fragile than Switzerland\u2019s was in the 1990s. The country\u2019s share of business investment relative to GDP is already now only on par with Italy among Europe\u2019s major economies, which also explains the United Kingdom\u2019s flat productivity growth, its large share of low-income jobs, and also its persistent weakness on exports. The U.K. is even more dependent on domestic consumption than Italy or Spain is. \nThird, the pandemic has hit British businesses particularly hard. London is forecast to run a budget deficit of a whopping 16.9 percent in 2020, compared with 9.5 percent in Paris or 6.3 percent in Berlin. Still, the OECD forecasts that the U.K. will have the worst year-on-year GDP contraction among major economies bar Argentina in 2020. \nGiven these difficult economic realities, it won\u2019t take long for British businesses to start to press London to reengage with the EU\u2019s single market, just as the Swiss business lobby did in the 1990s. \nBritish diplomats will likely spend the coming years in Brussels trying to complement the current deal by negotiating the United Kingdom\u2019s participation in some sectors of the EU\u2019s single market. And just as Swiss diplomats did in the 1990s, they will have to agree to conform to Brussels\u2019s regulations in return for market access. Over the long term, economics will trump concerns for sovereignty. \nBut at least the trade-off paid off for Switzerland. The new agreements granting Swiss companies single-market access and allowing free migration of workers with the EU entered into force in 2002. They helped the economy finally reboot. Since 2003, Swiss GDP growth has ranked third among Western nations. \nSo all\u2019s well that ends well, right? Not quite. Twenty-eight years after Switzerland\u2019s own Brexit moment\u2014and even with businesses satisfied by the market access agreements and the economy purring\u2014the EU question remains the most divisive in Swiss politics. And this is for two reasons. \nFirst, imagining that Swiss-EU relations would ever reach a stable equilibrium was illusory. The world keeps turning, new economic sectors develop, and interests change. In life as in politics, there is no end state\u2014discounting death. For that reason, the 2002 Swiss-EU agreements have to be continuously revised to remain effective. Put simply: Since 1992, negotiations between Bern and Brussels have never ceased. The same logic will apply to the United Kingdom\u2019s future relationship with the EU \nSecond, carefully crafted trade deals do not end culture wars. That\u2019s especially true since the camp on the winning side tends not to drop the issue, preferring to milk it instead. Swiss newspapers and politicians continue to find something to agitate over in an attempt to reinvigorate opposition to Brussels. This is the case whether there is a legitimate concern, as when the EU cuts out Switzerland\u2019s banks from its market, or a bogus one, as with 2008 claims that the EU would ban the Swiss national sausage. \nIn other words, British politics will remain consumed by its relationship with Brussels for decades to come, continuing to distract from other important issues. Over the long term, this opportunity cost may turn out to be the biggest harm wrought by Brexit on the U.K. \nAs another consequence of Brexit and the drama surrounding it, British people\u2014even pro-EU Remainers\u2014will come to perceive the EU increasingly as an opponent, not as a partner. \nIn permanent negotiations, the EU will continue to defend its perceived collective interests, with little regard for British public opinion. With London finding itself more often at the losing end of negotiations, it will resort to bad-mouthing the EU in order to defend its own reputation at home. The often unsatisfactory compromises with Brussels that London will be forced to accept will fan the flames of Euroskepticism in the U.K.

Nearly half of the Swiss were friendly to the idea of EU membership in 1992. Today, far fewer are. At the turn of the millennium, 3 out of Switzerland\u2019s 4 major parties supported EU accession. Today, not a single party is actively campaigning on EU membership. \nThe Swiss political debate has completely shifted from the benefits of prospective EU membership to what can be achieved in negotiations outside of the union. The Swiss who continue to talk about membership are painted as off-topic and as failing to address immediate practical questions at hand. Even the left-wing parties, which were traditionally the most pro-European, have abandoned the issue. \nIn statements about the last-minute Brexit deal, European politicians were quick to voice their regret about the divorce but also the hope that a new generation of Brits would one day knock at the EU\u2019s door once again. \nBut if Swiss history is any guide, that is unlikely. With time, the market access issues will likely be addressed, allowing the British economy to find its footing. But this will come at the price of Brits turning ever more Euroskeptic. The cards are now firmly stacked against Remainers. \n\n \n Source link  \nThe post A Look at Swiss Politics Shows That Euroskepticism Is in the United Kingdom to Stay\u2014Even Now That Brexit Is Done : ukpolitics appeared first on PNN - Paper News Network.",

                "text": "Let\u2019s all agree that binge-watching great movies and series have made our every day during this pandemic, a bearable one. With the current situation, some TV shows have had to suspend production while others are already gearing up for their final runs. From Lucifer to\u00a0Dead to Me\u00a0and Atypical, here are some of the shows that are set to bow out for good this year. Hopefully, there will be no more delay this year. \n\nThis heartfelt comedy was created and written by Robia Rashid and Academy Award-winning producer, Seth Gordon. The show tells the story of a young autistic man called Sam Gardner, who has decided that he is ready for some romance. In hope of finding love, he needs to be more independent, which means, directing his mother (Jennifer Jason Leigh) on her own path. It also portrays the struggle of his father and sister in seeking a better understanding based on his condition. Unfortunately, the show\u00a0will end with its fourth season, following a delay caused by the covid-19 pandemic. The final season should air early in 2021. \n\nDead to Me \nA dark comedy series starring Christina Applegate, Linda Cardellini, James Marsden and Natalie Morales. The story is about Jen\u2019s husband who recently died in a hit-and-run which led to a sardonic widow, Judy, determined to solve the crime. She has recently suffered from a tragic loss of her own. The unlikely friendship begins when the ladies meet at a support group. Bonded over bottles of wine and a shared of affinity for The Facts of Life, dark secrets lie underneath the friendship. Regrettably, fans of the comedy-drama starring will have to say goodbye to this show after its third and final season. The exact release date is yet to be confirmed. \n \nDear White People \nBased on the adaptation of Justin Simien\u2019s 2014 critically acclaimed film of the same name, the show portrays cultural bias, race relations, social injustice, misguided activism and politics. The issue follows a group of students of colour at a mostly white elite university, the fictional Ivy League school Winchester University. Led by Samantha White (Tessa Thompson), the students are faced with many issues, which still relates very much to today\u2019s \u201cpost-racial\u201d society. \n \nF is for Family \nSet in the 1970s, this animated raunchy comedy is inspired by the life of stand-up comic Bill Burr, who is a co-creator and executive producer of the series. It celebrates all things during the 70s, which includes the lifestyle, music and everything nostalgic. Besides, producing the show, Burr also voices the character of Frank Murphy, a short-tempered veteran who lives in the suburbs with his wife, Sue (Laura Dern) and their three children. Frank, who works at an airport, has a penchant for shouting and profanity-filled rants. The series celebrates all things the 1970s, including the lifestyle, the music, and all sorts of other nostalgic details. Set to be\u00a0ending with a fifth and final season this year with a yet-to-be-confirmed date. \n \nFeel Good \nThe critically acclaimed British comedy-drama is a deeply personal and poignant story about the modern\u2019s acceptance of gender and sexuality. Starring Mae Martin, Charlotte Ritchie, Ritu Arya and Lisa Kudrow, the\u00a0semi-autobiographical comedy show follows a recovering addict and comedian Mae (Mae Martin) on her attempts to control her addictive behaviours and intense romanticism in her life. As if that\u2019s not complicated enough, the story gets more interesting as she delves into an all-consume relationship with her new girlfriend, George (Charlotte Ritchie). The show is scheduled to be aired this air but there is no specific date yet. \n \nGrace and Frankie \nOne can never get enough of this American comedy series starring Lily Tomlin, Jane Fonda, Sam Waterston, Martin Sheen and June Diane Raphael. Grace and Frankie played by Fonda and Tomlin have been rivals for as long as they can recall. The plot twist is that their husbands have been falling in love with each other and decide to wed. Enemies turn to friends for comfort, Grace and Frankie begins to rely on each other as everything else falls apart.\u00a0Scheduled for late 2021, the show will become the longest-running Netflix original with 94 episodes in total, overtaking \u201cOrange is the New Black,\u201d which counts 91 episodes. \n \nLa Casa de Papel \nWidely known as Money Heist, this Spanish show proved a global hit when it was first released in 2017. It is about a criminal mastermind who goes by the name \u201cThe Professor,\u201d played by Alvaro Morte. He has a plan to pull off the biggest heist ever to print billions of euros in the Royal Mint of Spain. To support his evil plan, he recruits eight people with certain abilities to help him succeed.

Not to mention their take their later years in Los Angeles, a city that values beauty and youth.\u00a0While the latter will not return for the third and final season, the actor\u2019s absence will be written into the show for its final episodes. It\u2019s not yet been confirmed when the final season will land. \n \nLucifer \nMysterious in so many ways, this devilish show still has eight episodes from its fifth season left to screen, due in 2021. The story is about Lucifer played by Tom Ellis who is bored of his responsibility in being the Lord of Hell. He relocates to Los Angeles, where he opens a nightclub as a start. In time, he forms a connection with a homicide detective, Malcolm Graham played by Kevin Rankin.\u00a0Already renewed for a sixth and final season, the show\u2019s final 10 episodes could air in 2021, although this is not yet confirmed. \n \nOzark \nThe Emmy-Award-winning show was created by Bill Dubuque,\u00a0starring Jason Bateman as Mary Byrde, a financial planner who relocates his wife Wendy Byrde (Laura Linney) and two kids from Chicago to a summer resort community in the Ozarks. Byrde is constantly on the move after a money-laundering scheme goes wrong, which forces him to pay a substantial amount to a Mexican drug lord to keep his family from harm. The show will premier the first part of its fourth and final season in this year. The second part may be coming in 2022 where each part will comprise seven episodes. \n \n\n\nLost in Space \nThis futuristic show tells a story about the Robinson family fighting against all odds to survive and escape after crash-landing\u00a0on an alien planet.

                "text": "I'd heard of\u00a0Integralismo Lusitano, but until I read this, I knew virtually nothing about it. Fascinating! Now, I want to know more. From The European Conservative By\u00a0Manuel Rezende It was the spring of 1913, and the republican political elites in Portugal were getting restless. They had established their own dominion over Portuguese politics, ousted the last king three years earlier, and ruled over the country with a tight grip. The Democratic Republican Party had been an almost invisible party during the 1890s. The Portuguese constitutional monarchy managed to keep the influence of the republicans concentrated around the educated classes and in certain urban areas, mainly in Oporto and Lisbon, the main cities of the Realm. The increasing predominance of French politics in the country, the dictatorship of Prime Minister Jo\u00e3o Franco, backed by King Carlos I, and the subsequent serious decline in the popularity of the monarchist regime created the perfect storm for a Republican Revolution in 1910. The regicide of 1908, which took the lives of both the king and his heir, leaving the throne to an unprepared Manuel II, was the final touch. To be perfectly clear, there had already been a republican revolution in the city of Oporto in 1891. However, these republican partisans were very different; they were nationalist republicans who were weary of British influence in Portuguese international affairs and Portugal\u2019s economy, as well as the powerful and castrating influence of French political thought and philosophy on Portuguese cultural and intellectual production. Unfortunately, this first coup was unsuccessful. It would be a totally different one that would emerge victorious in Lisbon on October 5, 1910. These republicans were positivists of the French school: radical progressives bent on the destruction of religion and the Portuguese social order and committed to the establishment of a Jacobin-like republic that would change the cultural landscape of the country forever. What followed was not entirely unprecedented: priests and nuns were persecuted, while political opponents were taken away by authorities to have their craniums measured. (This was part of an attempt to establish phrenology as a valid method to explain the inferiority of the religious mind compared to that of the so-called rationalists.) At the time, in 1910, republican Jacobinism was a passing fashion in Europe, so Portugal was a political oddity. Thus, the main republican\u00a0caciques\u00a0became quite alarmed when they saw the Portuguese youth getting up with the times, especially, once again, with what was really going on in France. For powerful men like Afonso Costa, Aquilino Ribeiro, Bernardino Machado, and others, the news from Paris was disturbing. The old city of the revolutionaries had died, giving way to a new kind of political opponent: one that was far more terrible than the old liberal and conservative parties of the diseased constitutional monarchy.  It was called\u00a0Action Fran\u00e7aise,\u00a0and its leader was Charles Maurras. Unlike the French Legitimists, the Spanish Carlists, and the Portuguese Miguelists, these were not \u2018normal\u2019 traditionalists. They actually had an agenda other than mere ultramontanist Catholicism and an unbridled defense of the Throne. In fact,\u00a0Action Fran\u00e7aise\u00a0had close ties to the political thought of anarchists like Proudhon and was joined by great names of the Left, such as Georges Sorel. By 1917, these new monarchists could boast of their own magazine,\u00a0Na\u00e7\u00e3o Portuguesa\u00a0as well as the cooperation of unions, liberal workers, farmers, and segments of the army. As a movement, they called themselves\u00a0Integralismo Lusitano\u00a0and their leader was Ant\u00f3nio Sardinha. The birth of the Pelican Much like what had happened in France,\u00a0Integralismo Lusitano\u00a0received the support of thinkers and patriots who had quickly become disillusioned with the Portuguese First Republic. Why should they not? In the 16 years of the First Republic, from 1910 to 1926, Portugal had witnessed 45 governments, an endless series of coup d\u2019\u00e9tats, the dominion of far-left terrorist groups on the streets of Lisbon, and an average frequency of bombs exploding in the streets and apartments of the capital that surpassed that of the first two years of the American occupation of Baghdad. Portugal earned a negative reputation in European circles during those days, and the disastrous participation of Portuguese contingents during the First World War did little to help. Sardinha was himself an ex-republican. However, he would always look back to those early days as a revolutionary youth and, even combined his newfound Catholic faith, to the values he had been taught by the republican nationalists who had been vanquished in 1891.\u00a0Integralismo Lusitano\u00a0took much from\u00a0Action Fran\u00e7aise, but Sardinha made sure he would give it its\u00a0own\u00a0identity. The Portuguese integralists based their worldview in history and theory, claiming both the legacy of the Thomists as well as the novelties of Comte\u2019s positivism. They looked for inspiration in the medieval guild system and in the doctrines of Georges Sorel around the theory of myth. This unique blend of Tradition and Modernity sought to validate Portugal both as an independent organism and as a collective soul. That, in particular, was a consequence of Maurras\u2019s great influence. Maurras and\u00a0Action Fran\u00e7aise\u00a0were fighting the individualism that had been gnawing away at the roots of Europe ever since the French Revolution. Their great discovery \u2014 bolstered by\u00a0the work of Numa Denis Fustel de Coulanges\u00a0and the French Sociologists \u2014 was that communities had a life of their own, a collective destiny. To mark their movement as something unique and distinct from their French counterparts, the Portuguese integralists adopted as their symbol the Pelican, a Christian symbol relating to the sacrifice of Jesus Christ. A pelican was also used as the personal seal of Portugal\u2019s King Jo\u00e3o II (1455-1495), a great reformer who contributed to some of the greatest achievements of the Portuguese \u2018Age of Discovery\u2019 (such as the finding of a sea route to India). This 82 x 72 cm ceramic medallion, created in the workshop of Andrea Della Robbia in the 16th century, celebrates the memory of King Jo\u00e3o II of Portugal. It is composed of three elements, according to the Museu Nacional de Arte Antiga in Lisbon: \u201cthe pelican feeding its young with its blood \u2014 which is a Christological, Eucharistic, and political symbol associated with the motto \u2018For the Law and for the People\u2019 \u2014 forms the body of the emblem; the phrase \u2018IVSTVS VT PALMA FLOREBIT ET\u2019 (the righteous shall flourish like the palm tree), which is taken from the Book of Psalms (92:13), is the soul of the emblem; the top of the palm tree \u2014 which serves as the nest for the baby pelicans \u2014 is the symbol of righteous men.\u201dSardinha thus set forth to discover the \u2018destiny\u2019 of the Portuguese people, one that would be ruled by a regime suited to the characteristics of the Portuguese. This would not be a French style republic, nor another fake parliamentary democracy, de facto ruled by the capitalist elite; instead, it would be something else, informed by history and psychology. It would not be an effort at historical recreation but, as Sardinha put it, a\u00a0return\u00a0to something that should never have been interrupted, and it would be as if it had never been interrupted\u00a0at all. It was an organic, social monarchy, established as a democracy in its lower levels, a democratic municipality based upon the free association of communities and professions, followed by an aristocracy at the level of the administration of the state, a bureaucracy of merit and service, and on top the rule of the king, who acted as a ruler but not as an administrator.  Sardinha\u2019s ideas would evolve over the years. He even clashed with some of his supporters after publishing the infamous\u00a0A Quest\u00e3o Ib\u00e9rica\u00a0(1916), a book about the necessity of forming an alliance with Spain. His late political thought, however, seemed to have focused less on the dichotomy between monarchy and republic, as evidenced by the ties he formed with well-known republicans such as Ant\u00f3nio S\u00e9rgio. Sardinha\u00a0\u00a0and many integralists also cooperated with other conservatives, non-Catholic traditionalists, and leftist republicans to produce a magazine called\u00a0Homens Livres\u00a0(Free Men). Such prolific intellectual activity had its costs. By the end of his life, Sardinha\u2019s disciples were divided between those who supported authoritarian policies and those who wanted the implementation of true integralist policies. While recognizing Sardinha as a mentor,\u00a0Alfredo Pimenta\u00a0and\u00a0Caetano Beir\u00e3o, for example, quickly recognized Salazar and his conservative authoritarianism as a valid alternative. When the First Republic finally perished, giving way to the\u00a0Estado Novo\u00a0in 1926, despite frequently becoming the targets of censorship many integralists became staunch defenders of the new regime. Sardinha and the\u00a0Estado Novo We will never know if Sardinha, who died in 1925, would have been supportive of Salazar\u2019s\u00a0Estado Novo. He was certainly enthusiastic about many of the achievements and methods of Mussolini\u2019s Italian fascism, going so far as calling the Italian experience a \u2018fulfillment\u2019 of his own theories. However,\u00a0Alberto Monsaraz,\u00a0Jos\u00e9 Adriano Pequito Rebelo,\u00a0Jos\u00e9 Hip\u00f3lito Raposo, and\u00a0Francisco Rol\u00e3o Preto\u00a0\u2014 some of the most prominent successors of Sardinha in the leadership of the\u00a0Integralismo Lusitano\u00a0\u2014 would eventually come to criticize the\u00a0Estado Novo\u2019s institutions as mere formalities. These integralists were, in fact, the first victims of political persecution and censorship during the first years of the\u00a0Estado Novo, much more so than the republican left. Sardinha and his integralism envisioned parliamentary institutions that could represent citizens based on their regions and professions. He endorsed a corporatist chamber akin to that which had already been endorsed by many of the authors inspired by Catholic social teaching. To them, both the Portuguese\u00a0Estado Novo\u00a0and Italy\u2019s fascist state seemed to have failed in the creation of autonomous legislative bodies that could function without the guidance of partisan leaders like Mussolini or Salazar.  From what we know of Sardinha\u2019s methodical line of thought, this is a perversion of the\u00a0true\u00a0aim of such institutions \u2014 which is to function normally, as vigorous bulwarks of local, regional, and national traditions and independence. It thus would have been entirely unacceptable to him. Sardinha respected his country\u2019s institutions too much to settle for watching them becoming a mere tool for Salazar\u2019s projects. While not so important to Sardinha in his later years, even the failure to reinstate the monarchy only proved that, despite the fact that\u00a0Integralismo Lusitano\u00a0had formed and educated most of the political elites of the early stages of\u00a0Estado Novo,\u00a0the regime was ultimately a betrayal of Sardinha\u2019s teachings. Salazar\u2019s\u00a0Estado Novo\u00a0functioned under the premise of a \u2018normal existence.\u2019 However, there was nothing normal in the\u00a0Estado Novo\u2019s institutions. In 1970, In 1974, four years after the dictator\u2019s death, the\u00a0Estado Novo\u00a0would fall to a poorly organized coup d\u2019\u00e9tat without any type of relevant resistance on the behalf of its institutions. Sardinha dreamed of an Integralist Regime that could, like the traditional constitution of the Portuguese monarchy, withstand the passing of the ages, the incompetence of kings and rulers, and even the decadence of the national community. Instead, Salazar\u2019s\u00a0Estado Novo\u00a0\u2014 much like Mussolini\u2019s\u00a0Stato fascista\u00a0\u2014 fell as soon as its leader disappeared. Manuel Rezende\u00a0is a writer based in Porto.

Martin Luther King Jr., is part of every school curriculum and there's a federal holiday in his name \u2014 when even George Washington has to share custody. There can be no \"next\" King, and it's not fair to anyone to hand off that label. But after a year of conflict and connection around race in America, when we were shaken awake to unresolved issues from King's day, it's worth reflecting on who's carrying his torch in 2021. In honor of MLK Day, this Sunday Magazine introduces you to today's leaders across issues to which King devoted his life's work: poverty, labor, religion and civil rights. Looking for inspiration? Read on.                                <!--                         putting a pin in poverty                               1. Dr. Ala Stanford     There's something shockingly refreshing about when the can-do spirit kicks in. Dr. Stanford got tired of waiting for various governmental authorities to do something \u2014 anything \u2014 and kicked in a COVID-19 testing and treatment protocol in church parking lots wherever she could in Philadelphia, where she found Black residents hit disproportionately hard by the disease but lacking access to care. And when labs asked who was going to actually pay for the tests, Stanford, 50, also answered that call and did so out of her own pocket. Now she's got a Gofundme for testing and advocacy \u2014 while the government response still lags \u2014\u00a0as long-neglected communities of color continue to be skeptical of the vaccine and medicine in general.

Bynum     The CEO and founder of Hope Enterprise and the Hope Credit Union, Bynum is essentially a personal banker for the poor of the Mississippi Delta. The 62-year-old views his mission as largely a civil rights one in protecting the poor from predatory lenders. Having grown up in a trailer in North Carolina before becoming an accidental banker (he wanted to go to law school), Bynum knows his customers' plight better than most. Now he's taking those lessons national: Bynum was named to Joe Biden's presidential transition team to help hew a Consumer Financial Protection Bureau that lives up to its name.       Read OZY's 2015 Profile                               3. Gene Nichol  You can get pegged as a troublemaker for resisting the notion that poverty is a normal state that we should accept. But troublemaking has been the 69-year-old Nichol's line of work for some time. A law professor at the University of North Carolina, rabble-rousing columnist and former head of the university's center on poverty \u2014\u00a0until the university board shut the center down, likely for political reasons \u2014 he published The Faces of Poverty in North Carolina: Stories from Our Invisible Citizens in 2018 and followed it up with 2020's Indecent Assembly: The North Carolina Legislature's Blueprint for the War on Democracy and Equality. The latter book accused state Republicans of a political agenda hostile to the poor, to whom Democrats were indifferent. Someone had to say it.                               4. Joe Sanberg     This Democrat brings an unconventional strategy to grassroots organizing: He tells his volunteers to close their eyes and picture when they couldn't afford a bill or rent. It's not hard for him to conjure, even if the 41-year-old Blue Apron investor and former Blackstone consultant is now worth millions. After all, he grew up poor, raised mostly by his working mother while living in fear of gun-toting collectors seeking his deeply indebted father. Sanberg channeled that experience into numerous anti-poverty efforts, including a nonprofit called CalEITC4Me that has helped more than 2 million low-income Californians receive more than $4 billion in tax credits.

While poring over records from the Oakland, California, school district she discovered something hiding in plain sight: African-American male students were six times more likely than white male students to be suspended, and in elementary school they were nine times more likely to be suspended with 44 percent of the suspensions for \"defiance.\" So Brown has made a career out of pushing policy solutions into California's schools to improve equity and give kids a ladder out of poverty.       Read more on OZY                                                    our path forward to advance racial equity                                                  As the largest bank in the U.S., JPMorgan Chase & Co. is stepping up to foster economic opportunity and inclusion for historically marginalized communities. \"Systemic racism is a tragic part of America's history,\" writes Brian Lamb, global head of diversity and inclusion at JPMorgan Chase. \"It's our responsibility to do something about it, given the role of banks in the financial health of the communities we serve.\" Learn more about JPMorgan Chase's $30 billion commitment to providing economic opportunities in underserved communities.

Jalen Thompson     Just out of high school and still 17, he made waves by organizing a peaceful protest that drew thousands of people to O'Fallon, Missouri, a St. Louis suburb, in the wake of George Floyd's death. Many were moved by images of Thompson and other demonstrators linking arms with the local police chief while marching against police brutality. \"He was invested in our process \u2026 [the police] were on our side the whole time,\" Thompson said of the surprising gesture of unity. And he has continued his work as a freshman music major at Colorado State university, where he wrote articles urging fellow students to vote.       Read more on OZY                                                  2. Charlene D'Cruz     The Mumbai-born immigration advocate is one of just 15 or so lawyers who bore the entire legal weight of Trump's policies in the Mexican border town of Matamoros, where thousands of asylum-seekers waited for months with miniscule chances of actually having their court cases heard. But now D'Cruz \u2014 a rabble-rouser prone to bragging about her boxing skills to unamused Border Patrol Agents \u2014 may get the last punch. Rest assured though: If Biden doesn't bring meaningful change, this proud \"chingona\" will save plenty of jabs for him too.       Read more on OZY                                  3. Julie Emerson     The conservative firebrand wears her faith proudly while advocating for criminal justice reform in Louisiana, which has an incarceration rate among the highest in the world. Other Republican lawmakers make the pitch for fixing prisons mostly about cutting budget fat. But Emerson directly ties the work of reintegrating people into society to the church's belief \"in redemption and getting families back together.\" A member of the state house for now, the 32-year-old will be a key part in pushing the GOP to be \"not just the party of 'no,' but be the party of solutions,\" as she puts it.       Read more on OZY                                  4. LaTosha Brown     She comes from a family of farmers who worked the soil of the Black Belt in Alabama, growing vegetables and, yes, cotton, although her grandfather's real cash crop was probably moonshine. Now Brown is cultivating democracy as co-founder of Black Voters Matter, organizing voters of color in unconventional places (particularly rural ones) and playing a key role in the rising blue tide in the South. Most recently in Georgia, she helped plant the seeds that ultimately gave Democrats both the presidency and control of Congress.        Read more on OZY                               5. Cameron Whitten  The Portland, Oregon, fair housing and civil rights organizer once fought for housing reform by staging a 55-day hunger strike outside of city hall. Another time, he campaigned for mayor while wearing only a cardboard box. Whitten, 29, has matured in his approach since those days, but that hasn't tempered his enthusiasm for change. He used social media to keep activists informed and safe throughout the battles waged on Portland's streets during the Trump presidency. And when COVID-19 struck, he quickly pulled together a public fund that raised millions for Black residents and businesses shuttered by the pandemic.                                                labors of love                            1. Chewy Shaw  This engineer (real name Charles) pulled off a David vs. Goliath move, helping organize workers at Google's parent company. Newly elected as Alphabet Workers vice chair to run the new union's executive council, Shaw was tired of seeing co-workers being targeted as activists. So Shaw and others formed a group to protect the voices who might be more committed than others to the company's catchphrase: \"Don't be evil.\" The announcement this month could be a watershed moment for labor in Silicon Valley.                                               2. Sara Nelson     The international president of the Association of Flight Attendants-CWA, AFL-CIO, has earned her rise into the limelight the hard way. Working as a United Airlines flight attendant since 1996, Nelson (pictured above) now reps almost 50,000 other attendants at more than 20 airlines during a particularly tough time for carriers, travelers and those working with both. With air rage now being a thing and the formerly friendly skies being politicized over mask wars and flying rioters, Nelson has her hands full, even if talk has now shifted to whether she will join the Biden administration Department of Labor (she was a rumored pick for Labor Secretary, until Biden tapped Boston Mayor Marty Walsh).                            3. Alphonso Mayfield  Born in Mississippi, the president of the Service Employees International Union (SEIU) Florida Public Services Union is emerging as a go-to force in labor and politics in this always critical swing state. Mayfield, 42, organizes workers across the state's municipalities and school districts, and has been active in communities of color, while pursuing connections with labor groups in Australia, China, Norway and South America. An executive board member of the powerful SEIU International, Mayfield is on the rise.                            4. Sara Horowitz  She was declared a MacArthur Foundation \"genius\" at age 36. Now at 57, Horowitz is leading the way for gig workers, as founder of Working Today, which is best understood as a \"freelancers' union.\" While being the granddaughter of a vice president of the International Ladies Garment Workers Union and the daughter of a union lawyer helps, Horowitz's take on organizing freelancers was novel when she launched the first-of-its-kind organization in 1995. And coming next month? Her new book, Mutualism: Building the Next Economy From the Ground Up.                            5. Bethany Khan  The Culinary Union is a powerful political force in Nevada, a state that takes gustatory hospitality seriously with all of its casino trade. Engaged and knuckle-deep in it all is Bethany Khan, the director of communications and digital strategy for the Culinary Union. A daughter of immigrants, Khan was the first among 10 family members to go to college and the first to hold powerful feet to the flames in the name of comprehensive worker-centered immigration reform. Her present focus, though, is COVID-connected safety and economic woes, as the virus has hit workers in the gaming industry particularly hard.                                                                                  <!--                                                    fighting to restore the faith                                               1. Sen.-Elect Raphael Warnock     The Georgian will soon join South Carolina Republican Tim Scott as the only Black U.S. senators from the old Confederacy since Reconstruction \u2014 and the preacher ran his campaign straight from the pulpit of MLK's old church to boot. Warnock's race became a test of faith after his opponent spun his sermons as anti-patriotic and radical, a tactic that may have backfired when Black voters turned out in droves to carry his and Sen.-elect Jon Ossoff's candidacies over the finish line. While Warnock was able to run on puppies and sanity in the election, he may be pressed harder by progressives in Democrat-controlled Washington as he faces re-election in two years.                             2. Alveda King  MLK's niece has become a prominent conservative and Trump ally, making a sharp break from most of the King family. A paid contributor on Fox News, the 69-year-old regularly defends the president \u2014 including through his second impeachment this past week \u2014 as a friend to the African-American community. Whatever Trump's future holds, her Alveda King Ministries is dedicated primarily to ending abortion, which the born-again Christian says is her life's work.                                3. Ronald Lemmert     Early on as a new Catholic priest, Lemmert called out another pastor for abusing children \u2026 and was himself banished from the parish as a result. That was in the mid-'90s, but time vindicated the New Yorker, who went on to minister to inmates in the maximum security prison Sing Sing. Now he is a leader of the Catholic Whistleblowers, a group that works to reveal abusers and pass laws to better protect victims. His answer to what keeps him reforming is biblical: \"I've always been a good shepherd, and I'm not going to abandon the flock when they need me most.\"       Read more on OZY                               4. Jasmine Beach-Ferrara  When OZY first met Beach-Ferrara in an Asheville coffee shop in 2017, she stood out: a queer pastor in a purple state known for political battles over which gender could use which bathroom. Now the poetic politician is a bit more of a mainstay, entering her second term as Buncombe County commissioner. She led her community through the Trump presidency, COVID-19 and a national reckoning over police brutality spurred by the George Floyd protests \u2014 and her faithful were happy enough to re-elect her in November by nearly 20 percentage points. Could Beach-Ferrara be the next Southern faith leader drafted into a statewide run?                                               grabbing the global torch                            1. Zulaikha Patel  In 2016, teachers at Pretoria High School for Girls told a 13-year-old Patel that her Afro hairstyle needed to be tamed. She decided to tame school racism instead. After a tense standoff with private security forces, Patel became the face of a student-led movement to eliminate racial prejudice from South Africa's elite private schools that continues to rage across the nation. South Africa's \"Black Students Matter\" movement, inspired by the racial justice reckoning in the U.S., is hitting the country's top institutions on an unprecedented scale.                            2. Ada Colau  The 46-year-old Barcelona mayor's struggle against poverty follows her own hardship: While studying philosophy at the University of Barcelona, she had to quit one class shy of her degree because her family had hit dire economic straits. While this may have colored her 2009 formation of the Platform for People Affected by Mortgages (PAH in Spanish), a response to the bursting of Spain's housing bubble, Colau's work seeking a more level economic playing field has been award-worthy, earning her the 2013 European Citizen's Prize among others. Now she's in the midst of launching the World Capital of Sustainable Food 2021.                               3. Safoora Zargar     Like King, she did her time behind bars \u2014 an experience she suffered through while pregnant. Zargar, 27, a prominent nonviolent protest leader against India's new anti-Muslim citizenship law, was arrested in April for giving an \"inflammatory speech\" in northeast Delhi ahead of Trump's arrival there. She was released a couple months later, after dealing with inhumane conditions in Asia's largest prison, but still is barred from leaving New Delhi.

El\u017cbieta Podle\u015bna  She's on trial for offending Poland's religious sensibilities, something the country's ruling right-wing populist PiS party is keen to defend from enemies real and imagined. The 53-year-old activist had just returned from an Amnesty International advocacy tour when she was arrested for using images of the famous Black Madonna of Czestochowa with rainbow halos to campaign for LGBTQ rights. It's part of a long fight for Podle\u015bna, who's faced death threats for organizing strikes in defense of women and sexual minorities.                               5. Aminatou Haidar     It's known as Africa's last colony. Western Sahara, a territory occupied by Morocco for decades in contravention of international law, was dealt a blow recently when the Trump administration recognized Morocco's claims to the area as part of a deal to get Rabat to normalize relations with Israel. That makes Haidar an even more important \u2014 and embattled \u2014 presence. The 54-year-old activist has been jailed and beaten by police as she fights for 600,000 Sarawahis' rights. But she's also caught in a generation gap: Younger activists want to take up arms with the Polisario Front, beaten down by nearly 30 years of broken promises since a UN-brokered ceasefire. Haidar has long preached peace and negotiation.       Read more on OZY                                                  6. Maxima Acu\u00f1a     The 51-year-old Peruvian farmer (pictured above) withstood threats and violence from a U.S. mining firm to fight for the rights of indigenous communities to hold onto their land. Acu\u00f1a's refusal to budge single handedly stalled the Newmont Corporation's planned Conga copper and gold mine, which would have devastated the local environment and was abandoned by Newmont in 2016. But a lawsuit is ongoing, and a U.S. appeals court recently said it must be heard in Peru's corruption-plagued court system \u2014\u00a0a blow to Acu\u00f1a's efforts.                             7. Pania Newton  New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern is widely seen as a progressive leader, with a female Maori foreign minister and a strong record of fighting COVID-19. But Newton, a 30-year-old indigenous rights activist, is presenting a more complicated tale. Newton is challenging Ardern to do more for indigenous people and is leading land rights movements. She recently won a key battle when the New Zealand government bought a sacred Maori site that had been tagged for development.

                "title": "European Castles, Palaces and Fortresses, Oh My!",
                "text": "Life is a trip, traveling is living twice.  Omar Khayyam\n\n\n\nAlhambra, Spain\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOriginally constructed on the remains of Roman fortifications in 889, the Alhambra remains one of the most interesting and gorgeous fortresses in Europe. After its construction it was largely ignored and underwent renovations in the 14 century to add the palace and intricate details we see today. In 1333, Yusuf I, the Sultan of Granada, converted the Alhambra into the royal palace. In the 15th century, the palace became home to the court of Ferdinand and Isabella. In the 16th century, renaissance-style details were added and slight alterations were made over the centuries to better suit the aesthetic of those in power.  \n\n\n\nToday, you can tour the majority of the palace and the gardens outdoors. However, don\u2019t miss the spectacular views you get from the castle and the castle itself from the town. The red color of the stone gives the Alhambra a unique appearance you just don\u2019t see anywhere else. Tickets sell our early, so plan your trip well in advance. Yes, the site does get crowded during tourist season, but the Alhambra is truly a unique work of architecture with so much vibrant culture oozing from its walls as well as a fascinating history that you don\u2019t want to miss this! \n\n\n\nNeuschwanstein, Germany\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen you think of a romantic castle, you\u2019re probably thinking about Neuschwanstein. Built high atop a hill in Bavaria, Germany, this castle was commissioned by King Ludwig II during the 19th century and was paid for entirely by his personal wealth instead of using public funding. It served as the home for the king until his death in 1886. It opened to the public shortly after his death and has remained that way ever since. It did have a sordid past as a Nazi storehouse for stolen art and was almost purposefully bombed to prevent the artwork from falling into Allied hands, but the idea never turned to action.  \n\n\n\nWhile most people know that this castle served as the inspiration for Cinderella\u2019s castle, it also appears in several films including Chitty Chitty Bang Bang, The Great Escape, and inspired the castle in the Pokemon movie Lucario and the Mystery of Mew. Since its opening in the late 19th century, over 61 million people have visited and sometimes over 6,000 people cross its threshold each day. That being said, buy your tickets well in advance and maybe plan to visit during the off season.  \n\n\n\nEdinburgh Castle, Scotland\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdinburgh Castle might be one of the most well-known castles/fortresses in the world, but it\u2019s also one of the most interesting. The site has been occupied since the 2nd century giving it one of the longest histories of any castle. The castle was built in the 12th century (maybe earlier) as the seat of power for King David I and remained a royal residence until the 1600s. As its residential role waned, it became a military barracks and served as one of the most important strongholds in all of Scotland.  \n\n\n\nOkay, that\u2019s neat, but what makes it so interesting? It\u2019s the most besieged castle in history. During the span of 1100 years the castle was attacked 26 times and was involved in the Wars of Scottish independence and the Jacobite rising in 1745. Today you can tour most of the castle and even see buildings from the 12 century. I won\u2019t spoil the stories you\u2019ll hear about the haunted areas and the epic battles on guided tours, but you need to get yourself there to enjoy them asap.  \n\n\n\nMont Saint Michel, France\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVenture over to Normandy, France. From there you\u2019ll have venture a bit farther (approximately 0.6 miles) off the coast to visit Mont Saint Michel, a commune that is home to a world-famous abbey and tons of history. While it\u2019s not technically a castle or a fortress, the island itself is a natural defense as the surrounding land is flooded by the tides. The island remained unconquered during the Hundred Year\u2019s War where a tiny garrison drove off or drowned their attackers. Louis XI took notice of the island\u2019s natural defenses and turned the island\u2019s existing abbey into a prison.  \n\n\n\nEven before the Hundred Year\u2019s War the island was involved in conflict. During the 6-7th centuries the Gallo-Romans lost control of the island to the Franks who then gave control to the Vikings. Normandy eventually gained control over the island and further conflict had the island transfer hands. Today you don\u2019t have to worry about Vikings or Bretons, just the tide. There is a pedestrian bridge you can use to safely traverse the spans between the land and the island. For more dramatic views, try to place your visit so you can see both high and low tides.  \n\n\n\nPena Palace, Portugal\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNeed to spend some time along the Portuguese riviera? Don\u2019t we all? Pena Palace sits atop one of the highest points above the valley below and overlooks the water in all of its colorful splendor. Is that a dramatic explanation? Yep, but Pena Palace deserves it, especially since it\u2019s one of the Seven Wonders of Portugal.  \n\n\n\nPena Palace began its existence as a small chapel built on the hill. King Manuel I built a monastery on the spot several years after his father visited and felt extremely moved by the experience. After being struck by lightning and then suffering damage during an earthquake in 1775, the site (with the exception of the chapel) was severely damaged. After several decades of neglect, King Ferdinand II commissioned a palace to be constructed on the site and ownership fell to several kings after his death. The palace was purchased by the government in the late 19th century and turned into a museum. Now, it\u2019s one of Portugal\u2019s most visited monuments! \n\n\n\nSpi\u0161 Castle, Slovakia\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe ruins of Spi\u0161 Castle form one of the largest castle sites found in Central Europe. This castle was built on top of the ruins of another castle in the 12th century and quickly rose to become a force in politics, economics, culture, and administration in the area. The castle itself went through several building phases and ultimately doubled in size from its original design.  \n\n\n\nAbandoned in the 18th century as it was deemed too uncomfortable to live in (I find it hard to believe living in a literal castle makes life \u201chard\u201d but who am I to judge) and Spi\u0161 Castle fell into disrepair and later was destroyed by fire. There are 3 theories here as to why the fire started (I love a good mystery). 1. It was struck by lighting. 2. The owners secretly tried to burn it down to lower their taxes. 3. A moonshining operation went badly wrong and a fire broke out. All are plausible. Who knows what really happened? Today you can tour the ruins and learn about the archaeological excavations that uncovered some of the castle\u2019s past in detail! \n\n\n\nKremlin Citadel, Russia\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Moscow Kremlin is a fortified complex overlooking the Moskva River in the heart of Moscow. Of all the kremlins in Russia, the Moscow complex is the most famous and houses 4 cathedrals and 5 palaces and is enclosed by the wall and towers. The occupation of the site began around the 2nd century BCE by the Finno-Ugric peoples and by the 11th century it was gaining importance with the East Slavs. The Vyatich tribe built the first known fortified structure on the site which grew until it was destroyed by the Mongols in 1237 and rebuilt in 1339.  \n\n\n\nOnce rebuilt, it became the seat of power for Grand Dukes and eventually Tsars where it underwent remodeling and growth once again. Catherine the Great even had a residence built there during the 18th century. Over the different periods, the Imperial, Soviet, and beyond there were great periods of construction to bring the kremlin into modern times and to expand wherever was thought to be needed. Today, you can tour the Moscow Kremlin and explore its growth and expansion throughout history and view the Armory Chamber, Tsar Cannon and Bell, and even Russian wood sculptures and carvings.",

Biden Jr.\u2019s incoming White Home chief of workers, had a dire forecast for the course of the coronavirus outbreak within the new administration\u2019s first weeks, predicting that half one million Individuals may have died from the coronavirus by the top of February.  The present toll is nearing 400,000. \n\u201cThe virus goes to worsen earlier than it will get higher,\u201d Mr. Klain mentioned in an look on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union.\u201d \u201cPeople who find themselves contracting the virus right this moment will begin to get sick subsequent month, will add to the demise toll in late February, even March, so it\u2019s going to take some time to show this round.\u201d \nCommon day by day U.S. deaths from the virus have risen to effectively previous  3,000, and the Facilities for Illness Management and Prevention has sounded the alarm a few fast-spreading, way more contagious variant of the coronavirus that officers challenge will turn into the dominant supply of an infection within the nation by March, doubtlessly fueling one other wrenching surge of circumstances and deaths. \nMr. Klain, in feedback directed at states\u2019 disappointment {that a} reserve of further vaccines that the Trump administration had promised to launch didn\u2019t exist, mentioned that his workforce was \u201cinheriting an enormous mess\u201d when it comes to vaccine manufacturing and distribution. \n\u201cHowever now we have a plan to repair it,\u201d Mr. Klain mentioned, alluding to a federal vaccination marketing campaign that Mr. Biden introduced on Friday. \u201cWe expect there are issues we are able to do to hurry up the supply of that vaccine.\u201d \nAdministration officers final week urged states to loosen eligibility standards and to start vaccinating all Individuals 65 and older. Some states, together with New York, moved shortly to conform, prompting a surge of curiosity \u2014 and confusion \u2014 as 1000\u2019s of newly eligible individuals sought appointments to get vaccinated.  \nHowever there was no stockpile of further vaccine doses awaiting distribution to these states, it turned out \u2014 solely the quantities already promised, a lot of it to be given as second doses to individuals who already had obtained their first doses.  \nDr. Anthony S. Fauci, director of the Nationwide Institute of Allergy and Infectious Illnesses, mentioned on Sunday that he, too, had been making an attempt to kind by means of the confusion about what number of doses had been held by the federal authorities and the place they had been going.  \n\u201cI feel there was only a misunderstanding,\u201d Dr. Fauci mentioned on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press.\u201d \u201cWhen doses had been launched, an equal quantity was stored again to ensure if there was any glitches within the provide move that the individuals who received their first doses would clearly get their second doses,\u201d he mentioned.  \nAs soon as it was clear that manufacturing of the vaccines could be dependable, he added, \u201cthe choice was made, as an alternative of simply giving sufficient for the primary dose and holding again for the second dose, that as quickly as they received the doses obtainable, they\u2019d give it as a result of now they\u2019d trust that the subsequent quantity they\u2019d get.\u201d \nBrian Deese, the incoming head of the Nationwide Financial Council, additionally pressured the urgency of passing a $1.9 trillion stimulus plan that the incoming Biden administration had unveiled final week to help within the restoration effort, pointing to knowledge suggesting rising unemployment and that extra Individuals are going hungry. \n\u201cThe reality is, we\u2019re at a really precarious second,\u201d Mr. Deese mentioned in an look on \u201cFox Information Sunday.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ve received an acute financial disaster and human disaster, and we want decisive motion.\u201d \n\n\n\n \n \n\n\n     \n     \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnited States\u00a0\u203a\nUnited StatesOn Jan. 16\n14-day change\n\n\n\n\nNew circumstances\n201,732\n+9%\n\n\nNew deaths\n3,353\n+27%\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nWorld\u00a0\u203a\nWorldOn Jan. 16\n14-day change\n\n\n\n\nNew cases\n612,288\n+14%\n\n\nNew deaths\n12,342\n+22%\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhere cases per capita are \n\t\thighest\n \n\n\n\t\t\t\n\n \n\n     \n\n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGov.

Some followed federal guidance to expand eligibility to wider swaths of people. \nBut that promise turned out to be too good to be true \u2014 most of the stockpile had already been shipped out. And now those states are scrambling, finding themselves just as mired in the morass of the country\u2019s beleaguered vaccine distribution as they were before. \nGov. Kate Brown of Oregon, expecting the additional doses, opened vaccine registration to people in the state 65 and older, as well as educators and child care providers. Now, she said in a news release, the state\u2019s plan to start vaccinating all of its older residents will be delayed by two weeks. \nThe confusion began Tuesday, with a statement by Alex M.

Allen, wrote in a letter to Mr. Azar, which was posted by NBC News. \nMr. Allen and Ms. Brown spoke with an official from Operation Warp Speed, the federal government\u2019s vaccine program, who \u201cinformed us there is no reserve of doses,\u201d he wrote. \n\u201cThis is extremely disturbing, and puts our plans to expand eligibility at grave risk,\u201d Mr. Allen wrote. \u201cThose plans were made on the basis of reliance on your statement about \u2018releasing the entire supply\u2019 you have in reserve.\u201d \nGovernor Brown said on Twitter: \u201cThis can be a deception on a nationwide scale.\u201d \nOn Friday, the general public discovered that the Trump administration had already been distributing all obtainable doses for the reason that finish of December, after The Washington Publish reported the information. \n\u201cWho\u2019s going to be prosecuted for this?\u201d Gov. Tim Walz of Minnesota requested at a information convention on Friday. Mr. Walz mentioned he was \u201cnot sleeping\u201d over considerations that Minnesotans could be unable to get their second doses. \nGov. Jared Polis of Colorado mentioned his state would get 79,000 doses this week as an alternative of the 210,000 he had been anticipating. \n\u201cWe must always\u2019ve recognized to not consider a phrase\u201d from the Trump administration, Mr. Polis mentioned. \nSenior Trump administration officers instructed The New York Occasions on Friday that the reserved doses had been already being distributed to states and that they had been by no means meant for use towards vaccinating further individuals. \nShipments of eight to 12 million doses per week can be despatched out over the subsequent a number of weeks, a senior administration official mentioned on Friday. These shipments can be divided amongst these getting their first and second photographs. \nDaniel Larremore, an assistant professor on the BioFrontiers Institute on the College of Colorado, Boulder, mentioned that for governors creating distribution plans, \u201chaving the sands consistently shifting beneath your toes makes it actually exhausting to make these plans and get individuals lined as much as get the vaccine.\u201d \nFederal, state and native officers have traded blame for the defective rollout. Dr. Tom Frieden, the previous director of the Facilities for Illness Management and Prevention, mentioned it had been \u201cchaotic,\u201d tweeting on Friday that the Trump administration\u2019s present plan \u201cappears to be pointing fingers at states.\u201d \nThe \u201csolely path to success is a whole-of-government, whole-of-society method,\u201d he mentioned. \u201cIf we\u2019re divided, the virus will proceed to overcome us.\u201d \n\n\n\n\n\nA affected person arriving at a hospital\u00a0 in Manaus, Brazil, on Thursday.\u00a0Credit score\u2026Michael Dantas/Agence France-Presse \u2014 Getty Photographs\n\n\nThe extra contagious coronavirus variant found in Britain has now been detected in additional than 50 nations, together with Argentina on Saturday, and is believed to be driving surges in not less than two. \nHowever how broadly that model of the virus has truly unfold \u2014 and whether or not it might already be a consider different nations\u2019 surges \u2014 might not be clear for a while, as a result of the required genomic testing stays uncommon.

                "text": "The former Greek finance minister lashed out at the bloc after claiming the EU is now \u201ccongratulating themselves\u201d following Boris Johnson\u2019s historic Brexit trade deal. The agreement was signed by the Prime Minister on Christmas Eve. \n\n\nWhen quizzed on the EU\u2019s reaction to the deal, Mr Varoufakis said they \u201care congratulating themselves\u201d. \nHe added: \u201cThey are thinking, \u2018Oh, now we have gotten rid of the difficult Brits and now we can do stuff\u2019.\u201d \nHowever, he attacked the bloc saying they have \u201cfailed to take into account the dynamic process of disintegration has begun\u201d. \nMr Varoufakis went on to claim \u201cboth sides lost\u201d in the post-Brexit trade deal. \n\n\nThe rejoiner argued the \u201cmoment you split the European Union up you\u2019re going to send up with heavy costs for the weakest citizens on both sides of the British Channel\u201d. \nHe added the immediate refusal to accept the 2016 referendum result has had a detrimental impact on British society. \nMr Varoufakis said: \u201cOnce the referendum was done, the hard rejoiners \u2013 people including [Sir] Keir Stamer \u2013 shot themselves in the foot by continuing to back a second referendum.\u201d \nAdding there was a \u201cmajor act of disrespect to those who won the referendum\u201d. \nREAD MORE:\u00a0Boris faces fishermen rebellion over \u2018disgraceful\u2019 Brexit deal\u00a0 \n\n\nWhile other Member States have seen an increase in demand to leave the bloc, Mr Varoufakis does not think any other countries will leave. \nHe told LBC: \u201cThe worst threat for the European Union is an under the surface, slow deconstruction. \n\u201cThe greatest fear for the European Union is that it\u2019s going to become irrelevant.\u201d \nAccording to a Euronews poll, Italy would be the most likely of the \u201cBig Four\u201d member states to consider exiting the EU if Brexit proves to be beneficial to Britain. \nDON\u2019T MISS\u00a0 Boris and Biden \u2018have destiny of world on their shoulders\u2019\u00a0[COMMENT]\u00a0 EU dealt blow as Biden and Johnson \u2018to join huge trade partnership\u2019\u00a0[INSIGHT]\u00a0 Tory MP exposes EU\u2019s \u2018deliberate\u2019 plot to punish British fishermen\u00a0\u00a0[REVEAL] \n\n\nData from the Redfield and Wilton Strategies survey found that nearly half of Italians would be likely to support their country leaving the EU if the UK and its economy is in good health in five years. \nIn the event, France and Spain both showed moderate support for changing their relationship with the bloc. \nGermany was the member state least likely of the four major players to consider breaking away from Brussels. \nCharles-Henri Gallois, President of French political movement Generation Frexit, said he is in favour of leaving the bloc as they tried to \u201cbully and punish\u201d the UK. \n\n\nHe told\u00a0Express.co.uk: \u201cI think that Boris has done what you have to do in negotiations with the EU. \n\u201cThe EU does not negotiate in good faith. \n\u201cThey don\u2019t like a win-win relationship. \n\u201cThey tried to bully and punish the UK as they fear a successful Brexit that will give ideas for other countries such as France, to leave the bloc. \n\u201cI\u2019m in favour of Brexit because I hate the EU but I love Europe. \n\u201cI have many British friends, some of them within the Brexit Party, and it\u2019s great to see them take back control. \n\u201cThe EU will be great for European countries. Brexit and a successful Brexit are the key to help the continent to be free.\u201d",

                "text": "Mesut Ozil Signs For Turkish Club, Fenerbahce by obembet(f): 7:20pm\n\n\n\n\nMesut Ozil has officially confirmed his move to Fenerbahce, bringing to an end his topsy-turvy seven-and-a-half year stay at Arsenal. \nThe 32-year-old, who had not featured for Arsenal since March 7, joins the Turkish club on a free transfer after his \u00a3350,000-a-week Gunners contract was terminated. \nWhile the news has not yet been officially confirmed by either club, Ozil has now officially spoken out about the move, admitting he is \u2018very excited\u2019 in an interview with Turkish television channel NTV, also confirming that he will arrive in Istanbul on Monday morning. \n\u2018I am a Fenerbahce fan. That is why I am very happy to be coming to Turkey with Fenerbahce,\u2019 Ozil said. \u2018I\u2019m very excited. God gave me the chance to wear this jersey as a Fenerbahce fan. God willing, I will carry it with honour and do everything I can for the team,\u2019 he added. \n\u2018Of course, I\u2019m missing a few matches. I haven\u2019t played in a match in a while, but I am physically fit, I have no issues,\u2019 he said, adding he had been training with the first team at Arsenal during his time off the pitch. \nIt brings to an end Ozil\u2019s long and controversial spell in north London, where he won three FA Cups and one Community Shield following his arrival in a then club-record \u00a342.5million deal from Real Madrid under Arsene Wenger. \nThe 2014 World Cup winner with Germany has not featured competitively for the Gunners in more than 10 months, with his last appearance coming in March\u2019s 1-0 win against West Ham when he assisted Alexandre Lacazette. \nOzil leaves Arsenal having played 254 matches for the club, scoring 44 goals and recording 77 assists in more than seven years. \nHe was named the club\u2019s Player of the Season in 2015-16, when they finished second in the Premier League to Leicester City. \nOzil was also named the PFA Fans\u2019 Player of the Month on three separate occasions in 2015. \nThe playmaker was involved in the 2014 FA Cup final victory against Hull City, which ended Arsenal\u2019s nine-year trophy drought, as well as when they defended their Cup crown against Villa a year later. \nHe also played a part in the Gunners\u2019 Cup triumph over Chelsea in 2017, but came up short against the same opponents in the Europa League final two years later. \nOzil also played 90 minutes in the 2018 EFL Cup final loss to Manchester City. \nHowever, since signing a new \u00a3350,000 deal in January 2018, making him the highest-paid player at the club, he struggled to hit top form once Arsene Wenger left the club that summer. \nHe had a somewhat up-and-down relationship with Unai Emery \u2013 yet seemed rejuvenated in the first two months of Mikel Arteta\u2019s reign at the Emirates. \nBut he has not played post-lockdown \u2013 and has only been involved in two matchday squads, both back in June \u2013 and has recently taken to social media to display his affection for Arsenal alongside his disappointment at not being involved. \nHe was not selected in either the Premier League or the Europa League squads this season yet has continued to train with the first team. \nThe Athletic claim Ozil was set to earn around \u00a37million at the Emirates Stadium between now and the end of the current campaign, but an early termination was agreed. \nOzil has also recently spoken of his affection for Fenerbahce during a Twitter &Q.A \n\nhttps://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-9154599/amp/Mesut-Ozil-signs-Fenerbahce-seven-half-years-Arsenal-finally-ends.html \nHe teased fans by saying: \u2018 \nI grew up as a Fenerbahce fan as a kid in Germany \u2013 every German-Turkish person supports a Turkish team when they grow up in Germany. \n\u2018And mine was Fenerbahce. Fenerbahce is like Real Madrid in Spain. The biggest club in the country.\u2019 \n\nhttps://twitter.com/MesutOzil1088/status/1350841841294467074?s=19 \nWhen asked by another Twitter followers which was his favourite district in the city, Ozil replied \u2018Kadikoy\u2019, which is where the club\u2019s stadium is located. \n\n 3 Likes   \n \n \n\n\n\nRe: Mesut Ozil Signs For Turkish Club, Fenerbahce by Righteousness2: 7:27pm\n\n\n\nGood for Him and Arsenal Football club..

Biden Jr.\u2019s incoming White House chief of staff, had a dire forecast for the course of the coronavirus outbreak in the new administration\u2019s first weeks, predicting that half a million Americans will have died from the coronavirus by the end of February.  The current toll is nearing 400,000. \n\u201cThe virus is going to get worse before it gets better,\u201d Mr. Klain said in an appearance on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union.\u201d \u201cPeople who are contracting the virus today will start to get sick next month, will add to the death toll in late February, even March, so it\u2019s going to take a while to turn this around.\u201d \nAverage daily U.S. deaths from the virus have risen to well past  3,000, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has sounded the alarm about a fast-spreading, far more contagious variant of the coronavirus that officials project will become the dominant source of infection in the country by March, potentially fueling another wrenching surge of cases and deaths. \nMr. Klain, in comments directed at states\u2019 disappointment that a reserve of additional vaccines that the Trump administration had promised to release did not exist, said that his team was \u201cinheriting a huge mess\u201d in terms of vaccine production and distribution. \n\u201cBut we have a plan to fix it,\u201d Mr. Klain said, alluding to a federal vaccination campaign that Mr. Biden announced on Friday. \u201cWe think there are things we can do to speed up the delivery of that vaccine.\u201d \nAdministration officials earlier this week urged states to loosen eligibility criteria and to begin vaccinating all Americans 65 and older. Some states, including New York, moved quickly to comply, prompting a surge of interest \u2014 and confusion \u2014 as thousands of newly eligible people sought appointments to get vaccinated.  \nBut there was no stockpile of additional vaccine doses awaiting distribution to those states, it turned out \u2014 only the amounts already promised, much of it to be given  \nDr. Anthony S. Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said on Sunday that he, too, had been trying to sort through the confusion about how many vaccine doses were held by the federal government and where they were going.  \n\u201cI think there was just a misunderstanding,\u201d Dr. Fauci said on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press.\u201d \u201cWhen doses were released, an equal amount was kept back to make sure if there was any glitches in the supply flow that the people who got their first doses would clearly get their second doses,\u201d he said.  \nOnce it was clear that production of the vaccines would be reliable, he added, \u201cthe decision was made, instead of just giving enough for the first dose and holding back for the second dose, that as soon as they got the doses available, they would give it because now they would have confidence that the next amount they would get.\u201d \nBrian Deese, the incoming head of the National Economic Council, also stressed the urgency of passing a $1.9 trillion stimulus plan that the incoming Biden administration had unveiled last week to assist in the recovery effort, pointing to data suggesting increasing unemployment and that more Americans are going hungry. \n\u201cThe truth is, we\u2019re at a very precarious moment,\u201d Mr. Deese said in an appearance on \u201cFox News Sunday.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ve got an acute economic crisis and human crisis, and we need decisive action.\u201d \n\n\n\n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n\n     \n     \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nUnited States\u00a0\u203a\nUnited StatesOn Jan. 16\n14-day change\n\n\n\n\nNew cases\n201,732\n+9%\n\n\nNew deaths\n3,353\n+27%\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t \n\n\n\nWorld\u00a0\u203a\nWorldOn Jan. 16\n14-day change\n\n\n\n\nNew cases\n612,288\n+14%\n\n\nNew deaths\n12,342\n+22%\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhere cases per capita are \n\t\thighest\n \n\n\n\n \n\n     \n\n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGov. Jared Polis of Colorado, left, opening the state\u2019s first shipment of the Covid-19 vaccine on Dec. 14.Credit\u2026David Zalubowski/Associated Press\n\n\nAfter a promise from the Trump administration that it would release a stockpile of reserved coronavirus vaccine doses, several states were expecting a huge boost in doses. Some followed federal guidance to expand eligibility to wider swaths of people. \nBut that promise turned out to be too good to be true \u2014 most of the stockpile had already been shipped out. And now those states are scrambling, finding themselves just as mired in the morass of the country\u2019s beleaguered vaccine distribution as they were before. \nGov. Kate Brown of Oregon, expecting the additional doses, opened vaccine registration to people in the state 65 and older, as well as educators and child care providers. Now, she said in a news release, the state\u2019s plan to start vaccinating all of its older residents will be delayed by two weeks. \nThe confusion began Tuesday, with a statement by Alex M. Azar II, the secretary of the health and human services department, who chided states for not efficiently using their vaccines and urged them to open up eligibility to people 65 and older, as well as to tens of millions of adults with medical conditions that put them at higher risk of dying from coronavirus infection. \n\u201cWe are releasing the entire supply we have for order by the states, rather than holding second doses in physical reserves,\u201d he said, adding that vaccine doses would no longer be stockpiled. \nSeveral states then assumed that they would get an influx of new doses that could be used to vaccinate new people. Some, including New York, quickly followed the federal government\u2019s advice and widened vaccine access, prompting a surge of interest \u2014 and confusion \u2014 as thousands of newly eligible people sought appointments to get vaccinated. \nOn Thursday, Oregon officials discovered that \u201cthere were no additional doses available\u201d in the federal distribution system beyond what had been available before the Trump administration\u2019s Tuesday announcement, the director of the Oregon Health Authority, Patrick M. Allen, wrote in a letter to Mr. Azar, which was posted by NBC News. \nMr. Allen and Ms. Brown spoke with an official from Operation Warp Speed, the federal government\u2019s vaccine program, who \u201cinformed us there is no reserve of doses,\u201d he wrote. \n\u201cThis is extremely disturbing, and puts our plans to expand eligibility at grave risk,\u201d Mr. Allen wrote. \u201cThose plans were made on the basis of reliance on your statement about \u2018releasing the entire supply\u2019 you have in reserve.\u201d \nGovernor Brown said on Twitter: \u201cThis is a deception on a national scale.\u201d \nOn Friday, the public learned that the Trump administration had already been distributing all available doses since the end of December, after The Washington Post reported the news. \n\u201cWho\u2019s going to be prosecuted for this?\u201d Gov. Tim Walz of Minnesota asked at a news conference on Friday. Mr. Walz said he was \u201cnot sleeping\u201d over concerns that Minnesotans would be unable to get their second doses. \nGov. Jared Polis of Colorado said his state would get 79,000 doses this week instead of the 210,000 he had been expecting. \n\u201cWe should\u2019ve known not to believe a word\u201d from the Trump administration, Mr. Polis said. \nSenior Trump administration officials told The New York Times on Friday that the reserved doses were already being distributed to states and that they were never intended to be used toward vaccinating additional people. \nShipments of eight to 12 million doses per week will be sent out over the next several weeks, a senior administration official said on Friday. Those shipments will be divided among those getting their first and second shots. \nDaniel Larremore, an assistant professor at the BioFrontiers Institute at the University of Colorado, Boulder, said that for governors creating distribution plans, \u201chaving the sands constantly shifting beneath your feet makes it really hard to make those plans and get people lined up to get the vaccine.\u201d \nFederal, state and local officials have traded blame for the faulty rollout. Dr. Tom Frieden, the former director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said it had been \u201cchaotic,\u201d tweeting on Friday that the Trump administration\u2019s current plan \u201cseems to be pointing fingers at states.\u201d \nThe \u201conly route to success is a whole-of-government, whole-of-society approach,\u201d he said. \u201cIf we\u2019re divided, the virus will continue to conquer us.\u201d \n\n\n\n\n\nA patient arriving at a hospital\u00a0 in Manaus, Brazil, on Thursday.\u00a0Credit\u2026Michael Dantas/Agence France-Presse \u2014 Getty Images\n\n\nThe more contagious coronavirus variant discovered in Britain has now been detected in more than 50 countries, including Argentina on Saturday, and is believed to be driving surges in at least two. \nBut how widely that version of the virus has actually spread \u2014 and whether it could already be a factor in other countries\u2019 surges \u2014 may not be clear for some time, because the necessary genomic testing remains rare. And at least three other troubling variants are spreading less widely, according to available data: one identified in South Africa and two in Brazil. \nBritain, one of Europe\u2019s worst-hit countries during the pandemic, leads the world in identifying the exact genetic sequence of virus samples, known as genomic surveillance. That capacity enabled it to put the world on notice with an announcement on Dec. 14 that it had detected the variant scientists call B.1.1.7, along with the disturbing news that it was most likely the cause of skyrocketing infections in London and the surrounding area. \nThat version of the virus, which has been widely referred to as \u201cthe U.K. variant,\u201d though its origin is unknown, has so far left the most evident trail. It is believed to have helped push Ireland\u2019s positivity rate past Britain\u2019s to become the third highest in the world \u2014 over just a few weeks. \nAntoine Flahault, the director of the Institute of Global Health in Geneva, said the variants were causing concern all over Europe. He said that several countries were now trying to put in effect more frequent and systematic sequencing to get a clearer picture of their impacts. \nNone of the variants is known to be more deadly or to cause more severe disease, but increased transmissibility adds to caseloads that further strain hospitals and result, inevitably, in more deaths. Their emergence adds to the urgency of mass vaccination campaigns, which have had troubled starts in Europe and the United States; are only beginning in many other countries, like India; and are at minimum months away in many others. \nDr. Emma Hodcroft, a molecular epidemiologist at the University of Bern in Switzerland, said that outside of Britain and Ireland, scientists remained cautious about linking recent surges in Europe to B.1.1.7. \u201cFor most of Europe, the expected prevalence of the variant is still under 5 percent \u2014 likely too small to be making a big difference in case numbers,\u201d she said. \n\u201cWe do not need new variants to see increase in cases,\u201d Ms. Hodcroft added. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen many, many surges in cases around the world that we can confirm did not seem to be associated with variants.\u201d \nThe timing of the variant\u2019s spread is a crucial question for countries like Portugal, which has found fewer than 80 cases of B.1.1.7 but has a fragile health care system that could be easily overwhelmed. In the last seven days, its infection rate has been among the world\u2019s highest, with an average of more than 8,800 new infections, or 86 per 100,000 people. On Saturday, the country reported nearly 11,000 cases and 166 deaths, its worst day of the pandemic. The authorities imposed a monthlong lockdown on Friday. \nMany countries expect that B.1.1.7\u2019s impact still lies ahead. \nThat is a disturbing possibility in the United States, which has long had the world\u2019s largest coronavirus outbreak and is in the midst of a post-holiday surge. On Friday, federal health experts warned in dire terms that B.1.1.7 would most likely be the dominant source of infection in the country by March. \nNearly 20 European countries have found B.1.1.7 so far. In Denmark on Saturday, the authorities said more than 250 cases had been detected in samples taken since November. The country\u2019s health minister has predicted that the variant will predominate by mid-February. The country\u2019s coronavirus monitor also reported that it had identified a case of the variant found in South Africa, Reuters reported. \nMany countries in Europe are redoubling their efforts at mitigation. A nationwide 6 p.m. curfew went into effect in France on Saturday, and the authorities have warned that they could reimpose strict lockdown measures. Scotland tightened already strict restrictions, including banning drinking outside and barring customers from stepping inside establishments to buy takeaway food or coffee. Britain and Germany have closed schools. \nIn a stark contrast, the authorities in Spain have refused to impose a new nationwide lockdown, arguing that the recent discovery of dozens of cases of the variant was not to blame for a record surge in infections. \nOn Saturday, Britain reported eight cases of one of the variants found in Brazil, hours after the British authorities imposed a travel ban from Latin American countries and Portugal, which is linked to Brazil by its colonial history and by current travel and trade ties. Italy also suspended flights from Brazil, its health minister, Roberto Speranza, announced on Facebook. \nA leading epidemiologist said that a second variant discovered in Brazil was most likely already present in Britain. \n\u201cWe are one of the most connected countries in the world, so I would find it unusual if we hadn\u2019t imported some cases into the U.K.,\u201d Professor John Edmunds, a member of a group of scientists advising the government on the pandemic, said about the second variant, which was found in the Brazilian city of Manaus. \n\n\n\n\n\nVolunteers at a checkpoint outside a residential area in Jilin, China, in May.Credit\u2026Agence France-Presse \u2014 Getty Images\n\n\nChina\u2019s latest coronavirus outbreak has been traced to a salesman who appeared at a series of workshops in Jilin, a northeastern province in China, and has been linked to 102 infections that have emerged in recent days, officials in the province said in a briefing on Sunday.  \nThe man, identified only by his last name, Lin, had participated in a series of workshops organized by two health care companies over five days this month. He is among 34 people who have now contracted Covid-19 in the province during this newest outbreak, at least 10 of whom have been linked to sales events held in storefronts in the cities of Gongzhuling and Tonghua. \nIn all, 79 people who attended the workshops have tested positive for the coronavirus, as have another 23 people who were in close contact with them. Mr. Lin may have been exposed to the coronavirus by a couple who traveled with him on a train, according to a transcript of the briefing posted on the provincial government\u2019s website. \nThe outbreak in Jilin was the latest in a small but significant surge in cases in China in recent weeks. China, where the pandemic began more than a year ago, had largely brought cases under control but is taking extraordinary measures again to staunch the latest outbreaks. Officials have locked down more than 28 million in people in several cities, including districts of the capital, Beijing. \nAnd yet cases are still climbing, reaching an average of 149 a day in the last week. \nHealth care workshops like those in Jilin have become a profitable business aimed at China\u2019s growing population of elderly, though the businesses at times have been plagued by fraud and exaggerated claims for products. Mr. Lin worked for two companies, Yuansheng Quality Life Shop and Aishang Hanbang Health Club, according to the officials. \nLiu Shunchang, an official in the province\u2019s market supervision department, said at the briefing on Sunday that the authorities had begun an investigation into the two companies\u2019 workshops. \u201cSevere penalties will be imposed if there were violations of laws and regulations,\u201d he said. \nClaire Fu contributed reporting. \n\n\n\n\n\nPeople arriving at a Disneyland parking lot to receive Covid-19 vaccines on Jan. 13.Credit\u2026Valerie Macon/Agence France-Presse \u2014 Getty Images\n\n\nThe coronavirus has brought the travel industry to its knees. The U.S. Travel Association, a trade group that promotes travel to and within the country, estimates that nearly 40 percent of all travel jobs have been eliminated since the virus took hold in March.  \nWith hotels at record-low occupancy, some airports running on skeleton crews and fairgrounds emptied of guests, many domestic travel companies and operators have become part of an ad hoc relief effort, donating their resources and newly vacant spaces to help get the pandemic under control. \nDisneyland has been closed since mid-March, but last week the theme park in Anaheim, Calif., began serving as a vaccination super site. \nOn Wednesday, a section of its Toy Story parking lot was full. Emergency medical workers and local residents over the age of 75 lined up for the first of five Orange County, Calif., \u201cSuper POD\u201d (Point of Dispensing) sites, and Andrew Do, chairman of Orange County\u2019s board of supervisors, says they will soon be able to inoculate 7,000 people a day there. \nThe site is being run by the county, but in addition to providing space, Walt Disney Co. is providing some staffing assistance. \nMany other corners of the travel industry are looking for a way to pitch in to help end the pandemic. \nMore than a dozen U.S. airports now double as Covid-19 testing sites, including Chicago O\u2019Hare and Chicago Midway, Los Angeles International, Tampa, Newark and Minneapolis-St. Paul. \nSharon Decker is president of North Carolina\u2019s Tryon Resort, which is set in the foothills of the Blue Ridge Mountains and includes a 300,000-square-foot indoor arena. She wasn\u2019t surprised when Polk County, N.C., officials reached out to see if she would be willing to donate that arena as a vaccination site, although she knew it would present logistical challenges. The site opened in mid-December. \nThose robust public-private partnerships will be key to getting the United States out of the pandemic, said Steven Pedigo, a professor at the University of Texas at Austin and an expert in urban economic development. \nWhen it comes to a large-scale mobilization effort like nationwide vaccination, there is probably no sector better qualified than the travel industry, he said. \n\u201cThis is what they do \u2014 they move people, and they move large amounts of goods and services,\u201d Mr. Pedigo said. \u201cThey\u2019re in the business of crowd control. So it makes sense to do this at a Disney World or an Alamodome. They have the expertise for it.\u201d \n\n\n\n\n\nTennis players and their support teams disembarking on Thursday from one of 17 flights that the organizers of the Australian Open chartered to bring participants to Melbourne.Credit\u2026Asanka Ratnayake/Getty Images\n\n\nOrganizers of the Australian Open tennis tournament are facing a rebellion after nearly four dozen players learned that they would have to observe a strict 14-day quarantine because passengers on their charter flights to Australia for the event had tested positive for the coronavirus. \nAll of the players in the Open, the first major tennis tournament of the year, had been told that for their first two weeks in Australia they would be allowed to spend five hours daily at the tennis center to practice, train and eat; for the remainder of each day they would have to remain in their hotel rooms. \nTravelers to the tournament were expected to have negative results from virus tests within 72 hours of takeoff. They were tested again after landing in Melbourne, and four people on two flights were found to have the virus as of Sunday afternoon. As a result, 47 players on those two flights have been told they are forbidden to leave their hotel rooms at all for those two weeks, while their competitors may still train. Several of the players facing tighter restrictions said that they could not prepare properly for the Open, which is scheduled to begin Feb. 8. \n\u201cIt\u2019s about the idea of staying in a room for two weeks and being able to compete,\u201d Marta Kostyuk of Ukraine told a fellow player, Paula Badosa of Spain, in a livestream on Instagram on Saturday night. Kostyuk said she could not remember the last time she had not picked up a racket for two weeks. \nTennis Australia, the organization that runs the Open, chartered 17 flights from seven countries to bring players and support personnel to the tournament, limiting capacity to 25 percent on each plane. The 47 players facing a full quarantine were aboard two of the flights \u2014 one from Los Angeles, the other from Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates \u2014 along with some journalists, coaches and others. \nTennis officials appealed for less stringent restrictions on players who repeatedly test negative in their first days in Australia, but government officials declined to soften the rules. Craig Tiley, the chief executive of Tennis Australia, said Sunday that players were warned that coming to Australia involved the risk of being considered in close contact with someone who had tested positive, resulting in a mandatory 14-day quarantine. \n\n\n\n\n\nChris Panayiotou, the owner of Gee Whiz diner.Credit\u2026Michelle V. Agins/The New York Times\n\n\nChris Panayiotou, a burly man with a kind smile, was always known for his playful side. When he wasn\u2019t tending to the family business, the 30-year-old Gee Whiz Diner in Lower Manhattan, he loved to get together with his father to tinker with cars and computers, or build Legos with his sons. \nBut all that changed when Mr. Panayiotou\u2019s father died of Covid-19 last spring. \nPeter Panayiotou had kept Gee Whiz thriving through the Sept. 11 attacks, Hurricane Sandy and years of gentrification and soaring rents. The pandemic proved too much, though, and the diner closed in March; a few weeks later, the elder Mr. Panayiotou died of Covid-19. \nChris Panayiotou was deep in mourning. Gee Whiz remained locked up and untouched for three months. Mr. Panayiotou wondered whether he should just give up and sell it. \nWhen protests over the police killing of George Floyd began in late spring, setting off sporadic violence and looting in Manhattan, Mr. Panayiotou got a call from a handyman who worked in the diner\u2019s building, suggesting he should shore up the property. \nTo his surprise, Mr. Panayiotou arrived to find that the restaurant was perfectly fine. Indeed, the diner\u2019s doors had been covered with messages and memories by customers, its entry filled with dandelions, orchids and roses. \nMr. Panayiotou entered the diner for the first time since his father\u2019s death.

                "text": "Sometimes, the most unlikely of sources can make you see something that has been staring you in the face forever and has just passed you by. \n\n\n\nI am continuing my intermittent read of The Prose Factory by D.J. Taylor, and his chapter on the 1930s is, predictably, all about left wing literary movements. It is a reasonably fair account, I think, given that I suspect Taylor\u2019s own political inclinations are centre-right and he doesn\u2019t come across as at all sympathetic to Marxist views. But he manages to connect a few things that I hadn\u2019t really connected before. \n\n\n\nLet me try and put this into chronological order. In 1929, the Wall Street Crash had sent the Western economies spinning into the Great Depression. In May of that year, the Labour Party under Ramsey MacDonald had come out ahead in one of the tightest of elections and formed a minority government. That is not the most stable situation for dealing with the economic shocks that were to come over the next couple of years. So, in 1931, MacDonald entered into coalition with the Tories as the National Government, which won an overwhelming victory in the 1931 election. The National Government held something over 500 seats in Parliament, the only opposition being provided by a small group of rebel Labour MPs. Despite the National Government being theoretically a coalition, it was overwhelmingly dominated by the Conservative Party, with the Tory leader, Stanley Baldwin, taking over as Prime Minister in 1935. \n\n\n\nWhat this meant (and the connection that Taylor spelled out for me) was that the left had no political voice, just at the start of a decade that was filled with causes for which the left needed to be heard. And so the left started to turn to extra-parliamentary ways of making their views known. Thus you got things like the hunger marches, which had been occurring intermittently since the start of the century, but which now became much larger and more frequent. One march from Scotland brought 100,000 people to Hyde Park in 1932. These marches were often organised by the communist party, and so were just as often brutally put down by the authorities. The communist party was also behind the large numbers of working class young men who travelled to Spain to fight for the Republicans (there were some British volunteers who fought for Franco, but they were neither so numerous or so well organized as those who fought against him). \n\n\n\nBut this activism also had a more intellectual underpinning, provided by the spread of the Workers\u2019 Educational Association, which had been formed at the beginning of the century but which was at its largest and most successful during the 1930s. And also by the totally unexpected success of Victor Gollancz\u2019s Left Book Club, which aimed to break even with 2,500 members but had over 40,000 within the first year. The club would make books more widely available and far cheaper than usual, and published works ranging from George Orwell\u2019s The Road to Wigan Pier to Murray Constantine (Katherine Burdekin)\u2019s Swastika Night; books that brought home again and again the social conditions and political enemies that those on the left were up against. There were Right and Centre Book Clubs, but these had neither the reach nor the effect of the Left Book Club. \n\n\n\nWith the sense of community and purpose provided by the likes of the hunger marches and the Spanish Civil War, and the spread of ideas promulgated through bodies such as the WEA and the Left Book Club, the left found a powerful and often working class voice throughout the 1930s, just at the time when they had no voice in government.  \n\n\n\nThe National Government shed all pretence and became a straightforward Conservative government under Baldwin, as it remained under his two successors, Neville Chamberlain (from 1937) and Winston Churchill (from 1940). Under Churchill, and with a war to fight, the government again became a coalition National Government, but again it was predominantly Tory. After Baldwin\u2019s election of 1935, there was no general election until 1945, when it was generally assumed that the great wartime leader, Churchill, would sweep back into power. It was a shock, therefore, when Clem Attlee won an overwhelming victory for Labour. But it perhaps shouldn\u2019t have been, because that victory was the fruit of all those years during the 1930s when the left had been deprived of a political voice and so had found new ways to make their voice heard. The Attlee victory, if you like, was a direct consequence of Victor Gollancz creating the Left Book Club, which had, after all, published a book by one C.R. Attlee.",

                "text": "NewsPolitics \nInsight: How Scottish fishing is being sunk by red tape since Brexit\nFour months ago, Alasdair Hughson issued a stark warning about the impact of Brexit on Scotland\u2019s seafood industry. Like some latter-day Nostradamus, the director of Keltic Seafare \u2013 a Dingwall-based live shellfish producer \u2013 told The Scotsman a sudden increase in bureaucracy after January 1 would make it nigh-on impossible for businesses like his to trade in Europe.\n\n\nSunday, 17th January 2021, 7:00 am \n\n\n\nNow \u2013 just a fortnight after the UK left the EU \u2013 he is sitting with two tonnes of live langoustines in a tank and no idea if will be able to get them to the continent. The fishing boats he buys from are tied up in the harbour; and his customers, who are waiting for unfulfilled orders, are no doubt casting around for other suppliers. \n\n\n\u201cHave my worst fears been realised? Aye, you could say that. We have been talking about this for a long time, but nobody listened,\u201d he says.  \n\n\n \n\n\nSign up to our daily newsletter\nThe i newsletter cut through the noise\n\n\n\n\nBack in September, Hughson\u2019s dire predictions were based on the spectre of a No Deal. He told me the trade tariffs \u2013 which would have been between two and 20% for seafood \u2013 would be just about manageable, but the increase in paperwork \u2013 in particular the requirement for both Export Health Certificates (EHCs) and Catch Certificates \u2013 would not.  \n\n\n\nFishing boats are tied up at Tarbert Harbor. The SNP recently claimed that a third of the Scottish fishing fleet is tied up in harbour and losing \u00a31 million a week, causing fresh and high quality produce to be lost. Picture: Jeff J Mitchell/Getty Images\n \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s supposed to be all singing and dancing, but governments are notorious for catch-all systems which don\u2019t do what they are supposed to,\u201d he said then.  \n\n\nAnd so it transpired. In the end, a last-minute deal, which allowed tariff-free trading, was clinched on Christmas Eve but it did not eliminate non-tariff barriers. Worse still, the 206-page Border Operating Model \u2013 which sets out the hoops seafood companies have to jump through in order to export to the EU \u2013 was not published until 6pm on Hogmanay, just six hours before they were due to come into force.  \n\n\nThe effect has been disastrous: lorries stuck in central distribution hubs in Scotland while paperwork is processed, or on other stages on the journey, as the stock deteriorates inside. Some of the limited produce that has made it across the Channel has been rotten by the time it arrived. The price of fish has plummeted by up to 80 per cent at the market in Peterhead. Some companies have lost thousands of pounds; others, tens of thousands; a few, hundreds of thousands.  \n\n\nMost smaller vessels have stopped fishing, while a number of larger ones have been landing their catches in Denmark, effectively cutting Scottish processors out of the chain. It didn\u2019t help that fishing minister Victoria Prentis admitted she hadn\u2019t read the deal on Christmas Eve because she was too busy organising her local nativity trail, or that George Eustice, Secretary for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, referred to the system meltdown as \u201cteething problems\u201d. Tempers frayed, with at least one shellfish producer \u2013 Jamie McMillan of Loch Fyne Seafarms and Loch Fyne Langoustines \u2013 pledging that, if he couldn\u2019t get his produce to market this week, he would dump it at the gates of Downing Street.  \n\n\nSkipper Andy Brown works fishing for prawns on the fishing trawler \u2018Scotia Star\u2019 in the North Sea off the east coast of Scotland. Picture: Andy Buchanan/AFP\n \n\nDonna Fordyce, chief executive of Seafood Scotland, believes the industry is at breaking point. \u201cIf this cannot be quickly resolved, we will see companies closing, we will see some of the fleet going out of business,\u201d she says.  \n\n\n\u201cThey have already had the pandemic to deal with. They have had all the markets closing or vastly reducing. They have been trying to deal with Covid within the factories, working under new settings, with reduced productivity as a result of social distancing, and then the border delays or closure over Christmas, which is peak time, particularly for shellfish companies.  \n\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re in a very precarious state. There\u2019s no resilience left. Whatever reserves they had have been eaten away.\u201d  \n\n\nKeltic Seafare has certainly had its struggles. Last July, it made 10 employees \u2013 45% of its workforce \u2013 redundant, a tough decision taken on the back of years of Brexit uncertainty and months of lockdown. And now this.  \n\n\nAlasdair Hughson from Keltic Seafare\n \n\nHughson exports his langoustines through associated seafood company DR Collin & Son in Eyemouth, but he hasn\u2019t sent any EU consignments from Dingwall since January 1 because he realises they are unlikely to reach their destination.  \n\n\n\u201cDR Collin tried to export a small amount of product last week,\u201d he says. \u201cIt was weighed and packed on the truck, ready to go, bound for Boulogne-sur-Mer, but the truck didn\u2019t even get out of the yard.  \n\n\n\u201cThe environmental health officer was there. The goods made it through the inspections, but when it came to using the online government system, things started to unravel very quickly. They kept getting rejected even though, as far as they were concerned, they were using the information they had been told to use, the information they had been given by the Department of the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs [DEFRA].\u201d  \n\n\nHughson is comparatively lucky. Keltic Seafare is unusual in that it has the capacity to store large quantities of live langoustines for a short period of time; but it won\u2019t be long before he is forced to kill them and sell them as fresh or frozen, significantly reducing their value.  \n\n\nA Loch Fyne langoustine. Picture: Jeff J Mitchell/Getty Images\n \n\n\u201cWe are already losing money every day, as are the fisherman who are supplying us. Everyone in the chain is losing money,\u201d he says.  \n\n\nAs for DR Collin \u2013 Eyemouth\u2019s biggest employer \u2013 it is unsure of its future. \u201cThis has more or less finished the business,\u201d its managing director James Cook told Representing Border. \u201cWe can\u2019t sell anything.\u201d \n\n\nOne of the key selling points of Brexit was that it would be good for the fishing industry; once out of the EU, we would take back control of our waters. This line was still being promoted late last week. Even as chaos reigned, leader of the House of Commons, Jacob Rees-Mogg, was telling a near-empty Chamber our fish were now \u201cBritish fish and better and happier for it\u201d.  \n\n\nBut the industry doesn\u2019t see it that way. Boris Johnson hailed his last-minute deal as a triumph, but the fishermen accused him of selling them short. After a five-year transition period, the EU catch will be reduced by 25 per cent, far short of the 60 per cent cut the UK was asking for. Meanwhile \u2013 as forecast \u2013 the non-tariff barriers are crippling.  \n\n\nThis is particularly damaging for Scotland, which has 70 per cent of the UK\u2019s total fishing fleet and is responsible for 98 per cent of the UK\u2019s salmon production. The seafood industry contributes \u00a3301m to the economy and provides almost 5,000 jobs. This may not seem hugely significant, but fishing tends to be centred in areas which have few other opportunities.  \n\n\n\u201cSeafood is a product that needs to complete the journey from the North-East or the West coast of Scotland into markets in France and Spain in 24 hours,\u201d says James Withers, CEO at Scotland Food and Drink.  \n\n\nJamie McMillan from Loch Fyne Langoustines. Picture: Jeff J Mitchell/Getty Images\n\n\u201cBut we have gone from the point where a product would have had a single short form with it, to there being 18 different steps that an exporter has to go through alongside another eight steps an importer has to go through.  \n\n\n\u201cWe have a new multi-million pound trading system that hasn\u2019t been tested, so companies are struggling to get their heads around the paperwork. There have been problems finding the right product code \u2013 for example, the government doesn\u2019t appear to have a product code for monkfish tails, or it does one day and doesn\u2019t the next.  \n\n\n\u201cThe systems used by some of the logistics firms haven\u2019t been talking to the UK government systems and the UK government systems haven\u2019t been talking to the French systems even to the point where there was one debate over whether forms should be filled out in red ink or blue ink and another on whether 15-page export certificates need an official stamp on all 15 pages or just on the front.\u201d  \n\n\nThe situation is exacerbated by the almost universal use of groupage \u2013 a system whereby several companies send out small shipments of goods to a range of customers in the same lorry.  \n\n\nIn Scotland, most EU seafood exports are sent by groupage through three central distribution hubs \u2013 O\u2019Toole in Bellshill, Mesguen in Harthill and DFDS in Larkhall. Of these, DFDS is the biggest, transporting 3,500 consignments a day on 20-40 lorries. \n\n\n\u201cMesguen and O\u2019Toole are still doing groupage, but it\u2019s on a pretty small scale \u2013 four to five lorries a day,\u201d says Fordyce. \u201cDFDS [which withdrew its groupage service] have said they are going to start back on Monday, but in what volumes I don\u2019t know.\u201d  \n\n\nPost-Brexit, produce bound for the EU requires an EHC in the same way produce exported outside the EU did before. These would normally be provided by environmental health officers or official vets, but it was clear there would not be enough to cope with demand around the country.  \n\n\nSo the Scottish Government tasked Food Standards Scotland (FSS) to coordinate efforts at the central distribution hubs where the EHCs were to be issued. This should have speeded things up, but the overall system is complicated and there is so much documentation required.  \n\n\n\u201cWe land 65 species,\u201d says Fordyce. \u201cThat could go out as fresh, live or frozen; it could go out filleted or whole; one order could involve six different species, but equally an order for one species could come from five different boats, and all of that has all got to be documented: what weight you got off every single boat, how that was processed \u2013 it\u2019s very, very complicated.\u201d  \n\n\nWith groupage, an issue with one company\u2019s paperwork means delays for everyone else. \u201cDFDS gave me an example,\u201d Fordyce says. \u201cThey had a lorry packed and all the paperwork was there, but there was a discrepancy of one and a half kilos between the weight of what was on the lorry and what it said on the manifest, so they had to haul every single good off the lorry to find out where that one and a half kilo error had been made.\u201d  \n\n\nThese delays can prove costly. William Calder, director of Scrabster Seafood, lost tens of thousands of pounds on an \u00a380,000 shipment of white fish last week after sending it to DFDS.  \n\n\n\u201cThe goods arrived down [in Larkhall] on Monday night [January 4] and on Tuesday night we got an email saying there was an issue with paperwork,\u201d Calder says. \u201cWe asked what the issue was and they said there was a form that hadn\u2019t been filled in on time, so we sent them back the evidence to show it had been filled in in November/ December last year, and we never heard back from them, other than to say that the goods weren\u2019t going out that night.  \n\n\n\u201cWe tried to contact them all through Wednesday and most of Thursday but we couldn\u2019t get any response. It was so stressful knowing that our stock was there deteriorating day by day.\u201d  \n\n\nCalder, whose company employs 20 people, claims he finally received an email telling him DFDS hoped to send the consignment out the following Monday. \u201cBut our fish had already been there four days by then,\u201d he says. He arranged instead for it to be transported to Grimsby market where it sold for just \u00a318,000, partly because it wasn\u2019t fresh and partly because megrim \u2013 which is highly prized in Spain and Portugal \u2013 is not really eaten in the UK. \n\n\nCalder was told he could export goods again via groupage the following week, \u201cbut I wasn\u2019t prepared to play Russian Roulette and send another \u00a380,000 shipment away not knowing if it was going to get through or not,\u201d he says.  \n\n\nSo, what can be done? In the short-term, the Scottish government and Seafood Scotland are trying to support companies with their form-filling and documentation. \u201cSome of the companies are really small. They have never had to do the level of paperwork required \u2013 it\u2019s overwhelming for them,\u201d says Fordyce.  \n\n\n\u201cWe held a seminar involving over 100 companies with DFDS, FSS and the Institute of Export to try to make sure everyone was aware of all the information required. It\u2019s tiny things \u2013 like on the invoices you might always have written \u2018-002\u2019, but you can\u2019t have that dash now, it won\u2019t be accepted. If you don\u2019t just put \u2018002\u2019 the whole load will be rejected.\u201d  \n\n\nRural Economy Secretary Fergus Ewing has joined industry bodies in calling for the introduction of a grace period of up to six months before the new rules apply. The UK has already offered EU exporters a similar derogation, with no checks on imported goods being carried out until July.  \n\n\n\u201cOne of the really galling things in all this is a lot of this paperwork is serving zero purpose because we were operating to full EU single market standards on animal welfare food safety on December 31 and none of that changed on January 1,\u201d says Withers.  \n\n\n\u201cThe hope is that, now we have a deal, and we haven\u2019t crashed out with total acrimony, there might be a more benign environment and the possibility of a sensible discussion about whether these checks are benefiting anyone because they are not benefiting the EU customers and consumers who want this product .\u201d They are also lobbying for compensation for all those who have lost out financially as a result of the crisis.  \n\n\nOf course, the process should become smoother. IT glitches will eventually be ironed out and companies will get the hang of filling out the various forms, but most believe the system will still need simplified if their highly perishable goods are ever to make it to market on time.  \n\n\nThe situation is urgent. Companies have limited reserves and both their suppliers and their customers are already being lured away. Jesper Kongsted, a leading figure in the Nordic logistics industry, told Danish TV station TV 2 up to 40 per cent of fish sold at an auction in Hanstholm last week had come from Scottish fishermen. Such fishermen require a Catch Certificate, but once landed, the produce can be sold on in the single market without EHCs or commodity codes. The danger is \u2013 having resorted to this at a moment of crisis \u2013 it could become the norm.  \n\n\nAnd then there is the potential loss of customers in France and Spain who have been let down. \n\n\n\u201cThey will already be getting their produce from elsewhere \u2013 from Denmark and other places, \u201c says Calder. \u201cAnd they will be losing confidence. When we got word we could possibly start exporting again, I spoke to them and they were very cautious. Even if things do start to get moving, it\u2019s going to take several months to get their confidence back. They are going to be worried there will be shortfalls in their order book.\u201d  \n\n\nYet Calder sees no evidence the UK government appreciates the gravity of the situation. \u201cYou still have MPs in parliament coming out with farcical nonsense ,\u201d he says. \u201cYou have George Eustice saying prices are traditionally low in January. But a year ago, ling was making \u00a3179 a box and coley \u00a3170 a box and today they are making \u00a340 a box.  \n\n\n\u201cThe problem is, unless people do a wee bit of research for themselves, they will take what he says as fact. They will say: \u2018What are these fishermen moaning about? Prices are always low at this time of year. They just need to suck it up\u2019 .\u201d \n\n\nDonna Fordyce, head of Seafood Scotland.

During the war all trucks from the region were allegedly looted and driven to Addis Ababa. To transport the required food ratios to 4.5 million people more than 2000 trucks are now urgently required.\u00a016/01/21Extraits du rapport de EEPADuring the last three days, there has been heavy fighting in Daero Hafash (East of Axum) where four battalions of Ethiopian National Defense Forces (ENDF) and Eritrean Defense Forces (ErDF) were \u201ctotally destroyed\u201d by Tigray forces. It is reported that Tigray forces captured \u201clots of weapons\u201d.\u00a0The Tigray regional government issued a statement today: \"The government of Tigray has confirmed that Tegadalay Syoum Mesfin, Abay Tsehaye and Asmelash Weldeselassie were not in the war front due to their ages and health issues. Therefore, they are assassinated by Abiy Ahmed and Eritrean forces, very likely at the order of Isayas.\"\u00a0Brigadier-General Tesfaye Ayalew, Head of the ENDF Deployment Department, states: \u201cEven if there may be good people amongst them (Tigrayans) we can\u2019t differentiate the good from the bad.

The video shows a body taken away by a priest and shows the I.D. cart found on the body. EEPA reported that the massacre took place on 15 Dec., that civilians were hiding in the church and had been ordered out onto the square, before being executed.\u00a0The Catholic Bishop of Adigrat (Tigray), Abune Tesfaselassie Medhin, sent an appeal (dated 5 Jan 2021) stating that the people, including Eritrean refugees, have \u201crun out of food items, basic life-saving medicines, water, etc., and have no access to essential services.\u201d\u00a0The Bishop states \u201cmillions\u201d of people have been displaced, most of them women and children without food and water to escape from \u201cheavy artillery and air-strikes.\u201d The Bishop calls on humanitarian assistance to respond to the \u201cwar-induced\u201d humanitarian crisis in Tigray. Many of the areas have still not been reached by aid organisations.\u00a0In the last days, there has been fighting again around the Hitsats camp for Eritrean refugees. Eritrean soldiers killed many Eritrean refugees and took some of them to Eritrea. Some refugees escaped to the Adi Harush camp. A woman testified that in the flight from Hitsats to Adi Harush, 3 persons died.\u00a0It is reported that banks are the first target to be looted by Eritrean soldiers.\u00a0 14/01/21 Avis inquiet de OCHA\u00a0 Extraits du rapport de EEPA o\tENDF states it has killed three members of the leadership of TPLF who held high office in Ethiopia: Seyoum Mesfin, foreign minister of Ethiopia from 1991 until 2010; Abay Tsehaye, former Federal Affairs Minister and Asmelash Woldesellassie, ex-parliamentary chief whip of the Ethiopian Parliament.\u00a0 o\tThe Ethiopian Government is arresting former retired Tigrayan officials and their spouses. Many of those are said to be arrested from their houses in Mekelle. Official reports make it appear as if they were captured in battle. It is reported that this is not true.\u00a0 o\tThe ancient Monastery of Debre Damo in Tigray was bombarded by Eritrean soldiers using heavy artillery. Debre Damo, is the name of a flat-topped mountain, or amba , and a 6th-century monastery in Tigray, Ethiopia.

It should be noted that TPLF has more than half a million members in Tigray.\u00a0Eritrean soldiers have forced 6.000 refugees from Shimelba camp to return to Eritrea. Of those politically active, 120 have disappeared. Eritrean soldiers also killed 64 people in the camp.\u00a0More detail has been released on the massacre at the Maryam Zion Church in Aksum. On Tuesday, 15th of December, Ethiopian federal troops and Amhara militia approached the Maryam Zion Cathedral in Aksum. The church was full, and 1,000 people may have been in the building or the compound surrounding it. A confrontation happened after which people were forced to come out on the square. The troops opened fire and 750 people are reported to have been killed.\u00a0 11/01/21 Extraits du rapport de EEPA  Fierce fighting reported for the last two or three days on the Tekeze belt of Abi Adi of Tigray Central Zone, between Tigray forces and Ethiopian National Defence Forces (ENDF) and Eritrean forces.\u00a0Intense fighting in the North Western zone of Tigray, Endebaguna area, specifically DebreAbay and Meili area between Tigray forces and ENDF together with Eritrean troops.\u00a0Reported in social media that more than 160 civilians have been murdered by ENDF soldiers in Bora near Maychaw town in the Southern Tigray.\u00a0The Federal Ethiopian government has confirmed that Sebhat Nega, 86, the co-founder of the TPLF, was arrested and transported to Addis Ababa together with other TPLF affiliated officials. Sebhat Nega, also referred to as \u2018Aboy Sebhat\u2019 (\u2018father Sebhat\u2019) is a retired political intellectual, former director of the Tigray Endowment Fund and director of a think tank, the Foreign Relations Strategic Study Institute in Addis Ababa until 2018.\u00a0According to a source in social media, 13 members of a family have been killed by Eritrean soldiers in a village named May Cado, near Hawzen, Eastern Tigray.\u00a0The de facto division by the Amhara regional state of Western Tigray into two new administrative zones, entirely under Amhara administration, is carried out without legal procedure or without any official decision. The two zones are called Telemt and Humera-Welqayt-Tegede Zone. Tigrayans living in these areas are transported to Central Tigray and Amhara farmers are settled into the deserted places.\u00a0On 9 and 10 January shooting was reported in Mekelle during evening and night.\u00a0 10/01/21 Former Tigray region chief & TPLF chair Abay Woldu & Ethiopia\u2019s former minister of Finance & Economic cooperation Abraham Tekeste (Ph.D.) arrested, ENA reported on Sunday. Abraham was serving as Trade & Industry Bureau head of the region when war broke out Un article du Telegraph sur le r\u00f4le de l\u2019Erythr\u00e9e Extraits du rapport de EEPA  The Ethiopian army has reportedly built a fence along the Sudanese border to stop refugees fromTigray from getting to Sudan. Reportedly Ethiopian presence on the Sudanses border has been growing. A Sudanese TV channel reported that refugees stopped crossing for the first time on Friday.\u00a0Bloomberg reported that Satellite images show the destruction of UN facilities and other facilities in Hitsats and Shimelba camps. The images indicate that the structures have been intentionally destroyed. Eritrean soldiers have been reported in the area, and many reports have surfaced of Eritrean soldiers killing refugees and other civilians and forcing refugees back to Eritrea.\u00a0Shimelba camp is now completely deserted and Eritrea refugees are deported to Eritrea. Especially young men.\u00a0The massacre on the Orthodox Maryam Tsion Church in Aksum in which 750 people were killed took place half December. People hiding in the church were brought out and shot in the square in front. The Maryam Tsion Church is a sacred place which holds the Ark of Covenant. A witness with experience in war zones states he \u201chas never seen such a degree of inhumanity.\u201d\u00a0Reported that Tigrayan civilians from western Tigray are transported with buses to Central Tigray. The deserted houses in western Tigray are immediately taken over by Amharic settlers who are brought in.\u00a0There have been many reports of rape in Mekelle and elsewhere. A video has also emerged of and ENDF commander admiting that the rape is taking place in Mekelle. The commander says that while it would have been expected during times of conflict, it should not be happening now that the city is well under control of the federal government. \t\tThe number of IDPs in Tigray is at least 2.2 million people, and sources warn that starvation is used as a weapon. Without sanitation, there is serious concern for the health of the IDPs.\u00a09/1/21 Rapport de OCHA\u00a0 Un g\u00e9n\u00e9ral qui sermonne ses troupes sur les viols\u00a0 Des images de d\u00e9gats par satellites\u00a0 Extraits du rapport de EEPA  Report that Maryam Tsiyon Church has been attacked (local people believe with the aim to take the Ark of Covenant to Addis Ababa).

Yirga \u00bb Un message re\u00e7u ce jour\u00a0 \u00ab Dear friends of Hagere Selam, Some news gathered through 2 telephone calls with very close friends, yesterday and today. One in Mekelle says, the army is retreating from all sides towards Mekelle, they are losing battles against the Tigray Defence Forces. TDF is now as near as 2-3 km from Mekelle. Yesterday, shelling was heard on the Hagere Selam side. Another friend called yesterday from the surroundings of Hagere Selam. They climbed to a mountain to get network. They are very afraid because there is again fighting near Hagere Selam, between TDF and the Ethiopian army (ENDF). They are afraid for themselves because the Ethiopian army may take revenge on civilians if they lose. In the meantime a Mekelle University\u2019s high level delegation is at the Ministry of Education in Addis, negotiating their future. The delegation comprises among others the president and international relations head. Discussions are about functioning of the university, the take-over of Adigrat University staff and students, and future international partnerships. Today\u2019s EEPA newsletter reports a revolt yesterday in the ENDF in Mekelle \u2013 soldiers say that they are there to patrol the city, but are not ready to go and risk their lives in the mountains. Related or not, new Sentinel satellite imagery shows that 12 ha of grasslands around the ENDF HQ has burnt during the last week \u2026. Surviving in Mekelle is very difficult, especially for the poor: one needs to be able to get (a very small amount) of cash from the bank, and then to find food. Also in Mekelle, students and other youngsters are staying in their house because they are afraid for the army who would capture young men, to incorporate them forcefully in the ENDF to fight against Sudan. Rumours in Mekelle and/or wishful thinking are that ENDF is regrouping near the town in order to prepare a retreat. That\u2019s all so far.

                "title": "Alexei Navalny: Russia\u2019s charismatic anti-Putin campaigner \u2013 Times of India",
                "text": "MOSCOW: A charismatic anti-corruption campaigner, Alexei Navalny has been Russia\u2019s leading opposition politician for around a decade, determined to challenge Vladimir Putin\u2018s grip on power despite frequent prison stays and harm to his health.  The Yale-educated 44-year-old lawyer \u2014 who has said he will return to Russia from Germany on Sunday after treatment there for a poisoning attack in Siberia \u2014 has been banned from state television and was barred from challenging Putin in the 2018 presidential election.  Despite being frequently jailed and physically attacked, he has vowed to continue in politics after being poisoned with the Novichok nerve agent in August.  In a video announcing his return, Navalny said he was \u201calmost healthy\u201d and can continue recovering at home after a poisoning he insists was carried out by Russia\u2019s domestic security agency, the Federal Security Service (FSB), on Putin\u2019s orders.  Navalny has won a young fan base through viral videos exposing corruption among the elites and has more than two million followers on Twitter.  He has grabbed attention with his uncompromising rhetoric and coined phrases such as the \u201cparty of crooks and thieves\u201d to slam the ruling United Russia party.  In 2011, the anti-corruption blogger led mass protests when tens of thousands took to the streets of Moscow to protest vote-rigging in parliamentary elections.  Two years later the father of two stood for Moscow mayor, coming second against Putin ally Sergei Sobyanin.  In 2017, he accused then-prime minister Dmitry Medvedev of massive corruption in a YouTube documentary. That kick-started a fresh wave of protests across the country that was met with police violence and mass arrests.  The same year he had to travel to Spain for surgery after one of several street attacks left him nearly blind in one eye.  Navalny has faced a series of legal cases, which supporters see as punishment for his activism.  In 2013, he was found guilty in an embezzlement case involving a timber deal and given a five-year suspended sentence that disqualified him from running in elections.  In 2014, he was given another suspended sentence, and his brother Oleg, a co-defendant, was jailed for three-and-a-half years in a decision activists likened to a \u201chostage-taking\u201d.  On Monday, papers were filed with a Moscow court asking for that suspended sentence to be converted into jail time, a move Navalny\u2019s allies say is an attempt to block his return to Russia.  With the Kremlin tightly controlling the media, Navalny remains a fringe figure for many Russians, who are exposed to the official portrayal of him as a Western stooge and convicted criminal.  Putin has refused to pronounce Navalny\u2019s name in public, instead referring to him as \u201cthe person you mentioned\u201d, among other euphemisms, when asked directly about the opposition leader.  While barred from mainstream politics, Navalny has sought to expose the lavish wealth of Russia\u2019s elites, broadcasting the findings of his investigations to millions of Russians on social media and YouTube.  In his latest expose, Navalny last month phoned a man he said was an FSB agent involved with his poisoning, who appeared to admit to the attack during the call.  But despite tapping into discontent among a largely young urban middle class he is far from a unifying opposition figure, and some have criticised his anti-immigrant nationalist stance.  He scored his biggest recent political success in local elections in 2019, when pro-Putin parties suffered major losses because of a \u201cSmart Voting\u201d plan Navalny put forward after his allies were barred from standing in numerous races.  The tactic calls for voters to support the one candidate most likely to defeat the ruling party and saw Kremlin-linked candidates drop seats in the Moscow assembly.  Navalny\u2019s offices have been raided repeatedly since, while his Anti-Corruption Foundation was declared a \u201cforeign agent\u201d and ordered to pay several large fines.  \n\n \n Source link  \n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tShare  0 \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tTweet 0\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t        \n\t\t\t\t\t\tShare \n\n \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t     \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWhatsapp\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPrint\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n0Shares",

Two years later the father of two stood for Moscow mayor, coming second against Putin ally Sergei Sobyanin.  In 2017, he accused then-prime minister Dmitry Medvedev of massive corruption in a YouTube documentary. That kick-started a fresh wave of protests across the country that was met with police violence and mass arrests.  The same year he had to travel to Spain for surgery after one of several street attacks left him nearly blind in one eye.  Navalny has faced a series of legal cases, which supporters see as punishment for his activism.  In 2013, he was found guilty in an embezzlement case involving a timber deal and given a five-year suspended sentence that disqualified him from running in elections.  In 2014, he was given another suspended sentence, and his brother Oleg, a co-defendant, was jailed for three-and-a-half years in a decision activists likened to a \u201chostage-taking\u201d.  On Monday, papers were filed with a Moscow court asking for that suspended sentence to be converted into jail time, a move Navalny\u2019s allies say is an attempt to block his return to Russia.  With the Kremlin tightly controlling the media, Navalny remains a fringe figure for many Russians, who are exposed to the official portrayal of him as a Western stooge and convicted criminal.  Putin has refused to pronounce Navalny\u2019s name in public, instead referring to him as \u201cthe person you mentioned\u201d, among other euphemisms, when asked directly about the opposition leader.  While barred from mainstream politics, Navalny has sought to expose the lavish wealth of Russia\u2019s elites, broadcasting the findings of his investigations to millions of Russians on social media and YouTube.  In his latest expose, Navalny last month phoned a man he said was an FSB agent involved with his poisoning, who appeared to admit to the attack during the call.  But despite tapping into discontent among a largely young urban middle class he is far from a unifying opposition figure, and some have criticised his anti-immigrant nationalist stance.  He scored his biggest recent political success in local elections in 2019, when pro-Putin parties suffered major losses because of a \u201cSmart Voting\u201d plan Navalny put forward after his allies were barred from standing in numerous races.  The tactic calls for voters to support the one candidate most likely to defeat the ruling party and saw Kremlin-linked candidates drop seats in the Moscow assembly.  Navalny\u2019s offices have been raided repeatedly since, while his Anti-Corruption Foundation was declared a \u201cforeign agent\u201d and ordered to pay several large fines. \n \n Source link  \nThe post Alexei Navalny: Russia\u2019s charismatic anti-Putin campaigner \u2013 Times of India appeared first on TelegraphIndia24.",

Having experinced first-hand (with my father (RIP)) a free Social Security Health Plan in Spain, my native country, I could not understand why Americans were so worried abou the costs of such a Plan, a basic benefit for the residents of most occidental countries. The two main political parties in the U.S.A. seem to have forgotten that they exist mainly to ensure the happiness and well-being of the citizens and residents of America, nothing\u00a0else. In that regard, questioning \u2018who would pay for it\u2019 (a free, universal access, Heathcare Plan), does not make any sense, when you see, for instance, some of the retired seniors in the country, struggling to pay for their health, or for their medicines, with their meager pensions, does it? (we all get\u00a0old!) With both, the House and the Senate in his favor, Biden will have an historic opportunity to order the implementation of a free universal access Healthcare for all residents of America, even if he oppossed it in the\u00a0past. There is nothing better he can do for Americans. Nothing better for his\u00a0legacy. I hope he does\u00a0it.",

It\u2019s going to be very painful, but we can no longer have people divided: Around Sunday or Monday POTUS will send out a message saying, \u2018My fellow Americans, the storm is upon us. We will go to full global martial law.\u2019 He will most likely be on Air Force1, sending out 7 presidential messages to everyone\u2019s phones and tv sets worldwide on the Emergency Broadcast System. All global military via US military will shut down all media, all internet, social media, all tv programming, phones, all on one channel on EMS so that the US military can broadcast 10 days of the storm, 10 days of sessions, 3 hour video confessions, from military tribunals. There were lots of evidence for the scandals listed in the storm. While this is happening, the government will be making global arrests. Americans will be arrested around the globe and people who participated in this coup attempt against the President of the United States.\u201d\u2026 A US Air Force Pilot \n\n\n\nJudy Note: The Free World, led by the US, was in a war between Good and Evil. A Sat*an-worshipping Cabal was trying to take us over using their international chi*ld pedo*phile, gun running, drug and money laundering ring. Since at least the end of World War II all has been run by the Vatican to blackmail political elites, Mass Media and the US Court system to do their bidding. \n\n\n\nFor over 35 years and led by the Chinese Communist Party in cooperation with other communist nations, they have infiltrated all aspects of America with a goal of implementing socialism and taking over the US. \n\n\n\nTo head the fight President Trump has been designated as Commander in Chief over a world-wide organized Alliance and had use of different countries\u2019 military special op teams across the globe. \n\n\n\nOver twenty years ago the Q team formed, hooked up with hundreds of world leaders in the global Alliance and formulated a plan to take down this Cabal. Both sides were using dueling AI (Artificial Intelligence) computing systems to plot their next moves at light speed. \n\n\n\nThere was a mountain of evidence to prove that Democrats had colluded with foreign powers to steal the 2020 Presidential election from Trump to B*iden. There was a boatload of evidence and investigations that showed that over forty years ago B*iden and later H*arris, had been compromised by the Chinese Communist Party. \n\n\n\nBefore the 2020 Election Trump cleared with the Supreme about the Constitution: if there was any foreign interference in the election it would be declared null and void and he would be win by default. Now he had evidence that Italy, Spain, Germany, China, Canada and the UK were involved in changing the fraudulent 2020 Election where Trump votes were changed to Biden. \n\n\n\nElection Fraud under an active State of War was considered treason. P*elosi and all other members of Congress forfeited their rights and offices by committing this treason. They were no longer lawful members of Congress thanks to Section 3 of 14th Amendment and considered enemies of the Republic who aided a foreign power in stealing an election. \n\n\n\nPresident Donald J. Trump was legally required to act on this because of his own oath to the Constitution: to protect our Republic from enemies both Foreign and Domestic. Crimes on indictments of those involved read: Treason, Sedition and Crimes Against Humanity. \n\n\n\nPresident Trump, the Q Team and Alliance\u2019s job was to wake up the American people as to this treason so as to save America and the Free World from a Communist takeover. \n\n\n\nDr. Peter K. Navarro investigated the 2020 election results and published a three volume Election Fraud Report: https://navarroreport.com/ \n\n\n\nThe Immaculate Deception 12.15.20: https://img1.wsimg.com/blobby/go/be36dc6d-0df4-4c20-addf-fca72be46150/The%20Art%20of%20the%20Steal%201.5.21%20FINAL.pdf \n\n\n\nThe Art of the Steal 1.5.21: https://img1.wsimg.com/blobby/go/be36dc6d-0df4-4c20-addf-fca72be46150/The%20Art%20of%20the%20Steal%201.5.21%20FINAL.pdf \n\n\n\nThe Navarro Report Volume III Final 1.13.21: https://img1.wsimg.com/blobby/go/be36dc6d-0df4-4c20-addf-fca72be46150/The%20Navarro%20Report%20Volume%20III%20Final%201.13.21-0001.pdf \n\n\n\nNoted Attorney Lin Wood wrote a summary of Trump\u2019s Sting that would arrest the Swamp: \n\n\n\nMake them commit treason. \n\n\n\nGather them in one place: B*iden\u2019s inauguration. \n\n\n\nCall for National Guard under the guise of riot control. \n\n\n\nArrest. Detain. Guantanamo Bay. \n\n\n\nCalendar: Over the next two weeks we would learn shocking information about many of our government officials and wealthy elite. Their involvement in a Chi*ld Se*x Traffic*king and Pedo*philia Ring was basic to their worship of Sat*an in order to gain power, money and prestige. \n\n\n\nThis last week a Military Intel Contact, former covert operations Agent Robert David Steele, Simeon Parks, Dr. Charlie Ward, Juan O\u2019Savin (JFK Jr.), Attorney Lin Wood, Ben Fulford and former covert operations Agent Dr. Steve Pieczenik have revealed a mound of Intel on an upcoming Great Awakening of America and people around the world on how the Chinese Communist Party planned to take over the Free World. They started by fraudulently swinging Trump votes to B*iden in the 2020 Election. \n\n\n\nTrump\u2019s Sting: POTUS was in charge of a global Sting Operation to take down the Cabal through exposing the fraudulent 2020 Election. Trump has not conceded and would remain as President of the US until a new election was held. \n\n\n\nTrump and the military White Hats were executing a very deliberate plan to entrap B*iden and the D*eep State Rats in their own treasonous acts. The plan was laid out according to the 14th Amendment, section 3 by which arrests would be legally executed at the time chosen by POTUS and the White Hats. \n\n\n\nThe attack on the Cabal would start with a Tweet that said something the effect of, \u201cMy fellow Americans, the Storm is now upon us.\u201d \n\n\n\nThe Great Awakening would be ushered in with a broadcast of a panel discussion by Robert David Steele, Simeon Parks, Dr. Charlie Ward and Juan O\u2019Savin (JFK Jr.). \n\n\n\nRight now there were 25,000 troops in DC under the guise of riot control for the Inauguration. More troops across the country were on one hour standby \u2013 all in major Democrat cities. ANG brings National Guard troops to Washington: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Elr8nRlD0d4&feature=youtu.behttps://www.thedrive.com/the-war-zone/38753/those-mysterious-gray-helicopters-were-landing-on-multiple-downtown-la-rooftops-last-night \n\n\n\nTrump was in charge of the National Guard in Washington DC and was doing everything according to the Constitution. They knew who the dirt bags were in Washington DC, who were the ones in the middle and who were Patriots. Trump has people to fill the voids of office if such occurred \u2013 he has replacement people on standby. \n\n\n\nThere have been no preparations on Capitol Hill for B*iden\u2019s Inauguration. Though, there were 21,421 National Guardsmen surrounding Capitol Hill and the White House. The military has installed 10 miles of fencing with barbed wire around Capitol Hill. The Inauguration Parade was cancelled weeks ago. On Fri. 15 Jan. and Mon. 18 Jan. B*iden was supposed to rehearse his Inauguration and Speech, but both events were cancelled. \n\n\n\nWe don\u2019t know what would really occur, though on Wed. 20 Jan. there was a real possibility that the people behind B*iden, along with the Fake News Mass Media, would create and carry a fake electronic B*iden Inauguration. If so, within 12 hours of that broadcast the Alliance would take down the Mass Media. \n\n\n\nTrump has said, \u201cI\u2019m drafting an Executive Order to take the following propaganda media outlets off the airwaves: ABC, NBC, CBS, Fox News, CNN and MSNBC. I am also working with the FCC to pull their licenses. We have evidence that all of these media organizations employ agents of the Chinese Communist Party as well as embedded CIA Agents whose sole purpose is to brainwash, hypnotize and direct public opinion toward certain agendas that support the Left and D*eep State. These organizations are a threat to national security and virtually nothing they report is actual news.\u201d \n\n\n\nThere would be a government shut-down at, or after the Wed 20 Jan. so-called \u201cInauguration.\u201d \n\n\n\nIn the days to follow Mass Arrests of treasonous political and global elites worldwide would be in full force. There were 220,000-to-500,000 sealed indictments filed in federal courts across the nation since Trump took office. Since 2016 US Attorney General for Utah John Huber and his 740 investigators had been very busy gathering Intel, holding state Grand Juries and filing the indictments. The indictments would be unsealed, served, with D*eep Staters arrested in up to 400 cities across the country. Among those on the list to be arrested were B*iden, O*bama, H*arris, Cheney and Chief Justice John Roberts. \n\n\n\nIf the treasonous Mass Media continued to cover up what was really going on the stations would be taken off the airwaves. After which Ten Days of Media Darkness was planned as the Emergency Broadcast System (EBS) activated. Power outages may occur, but they would be kept to a minimum.TV, cell phones could go down worldwide. \n\n\n\nPOTUS would put out seven different messages on the EBS. Declassification of long held classified documents about treasonous acts by politicians would continue to come out via Fox News\u2019 Lou Dobbs. Disclosure videos would air for about ten days that were said to be very upsetting and shocking. \n\n\n\nSeveral Democrats in DC, mayors, 24 US governors and Rino Republicans were arrested some time ago, but it didn\u2019t become public knowledge until Jan. 12. The 24 US governors were charged with treason \u2013 their names appearing on China Bank with money transfers. \n\n\n\nGeneral Thomas McInerney was on the record to say the Special Forces captured computers belonging to members of Congress including that of House Speaker Nancy P*elosi on Wed. 14 Jan. These are filled with incriminating proof about election theft etc. There were unconfirmed reports from CIA sources that Nancy P*elosi was subsequently arrested at the Canadian border. \n\n\n\nBy Fri. 15 Jan. they had issued indictments to members of Congress believed to have committed treason. \n\n\n\nWhen Mass Arrests were completed 95% of politicians in Washington were said to be under arrest, most charged with treason. \n\n\n\nThere were 800 FEMA Camps built by the Cabal across the nation that were now going to, along with a remodeled GITMO, house those arrested. \n\n\n\nThere were three scenarios for the Inauguration: (1) Trump would be inaugurated in the White House, B*iden and D*eep State players, arrested. (2) Neither Trump nor B*iden would be inaugurated on Wed 6 Jan. and there would be an announcement of a transitional government until election fraud evidence could be investigated and adjudicated by state legislatures in the six swing states of GA, PA, MI, WI, AZ, NV. Under this scenario D*eep State players may be arrested. (3) POTUS & DoD and military White Hats standing with Trump may let the D*eep State soap opera do their version of a B*iden Inauguration in the Supreme Court presided over by Chief Justice [chief traitor] Roberts. Because the D*eep State US Corporation of 1871 was bankrupt and dissolved as of Thurs. 5 Nov. 2020, the D*eep State traitors would be inaugurating B*iden into a nonexistent office to keep up their charade of power, control and money faucets going as long as possible. They would be arrested at a point chosen by POTUS and the White Hats. \n\n\n\nA. Sat. 16 Jan. Twenty Points of Why America is Transitioning Corporate to Republic and B*iden Will Not Be President:https://beforeitsnews.com/opinion-conservative/2021/01/capt-ed-hayes-ret-20-points-of-why-america-is-transitioning-corporate-to-republic-biden-will-not-be-president-a-must-read-3561888.html \n\n\n\n1. Trump was not running for just another 4 year election in 2016 \u2013 Trump was approached by the military to run and his entire win has been and still is a military operation. \n\n\n\n2. Trump\u2019s first 4 years was to drain the lower swamp first. The swamp was/is deep and incorporated every industry in the world, banking, movie, pharmaceutical, food, you name it they controlled it; much has been handled. \n\n\n\n3. Before leaving office B*arack O*bama signed an Executive Order to pardon anyone prior of any crimes in the government. This is WHY no one was held accountable when the Trump took office. \n\n\n\n4. These swamp rats could not be tried for those crimes (ie: H*illary email scandal, C*linton Foundation, FISA spying on the Trump campaign etc) ~ only crimes AFTER O*bama left office could be tried \u2013 therefore, new crimes had to be snared. \n\n\n\n5. The military needed to catch them in the act committing crimes with proof. \n\n\n\n6. President Trump said in his speech January 7th, 2021: there will be \u201ca smooth, orderly transition of power.\u201d \n\n\n\n7. This in no way means that President Trump is transitioning power from his first term to Joe B*iden! Did you hear him say Joe B*iden? \n\n\n\n8. We are transitioning from the defunct USA Corp to the Republic (not B*iden). President Trump will not technically get a \u201csecond term\u201d and as he tweeted, \u201cwon\u2019t be at the Inauguration Day in January\u201d ~ this means there won\u2019t be an Inauguration Day. This was the last recorded term of a President who served in the \u201cAmerican Corporation\u201d. \n\n\n\n9. President Trump dismantled the Banking Act of 1781 from England. The United States is going back to being a Republic and Donald J Trump will be the first President of the new republic with the Constitution fully intact. \n\n\n\n10. The start date for the new Republic is March 4, 2021 ~ this was the original start date of the new President (until it was changed under FDR in 1933). \n\n\n\n11. At the end of President Trump\u2019s speech he said: \u201cOur incredible journey is only just beginning.\u201d Boom \n\n\n\n12. No matter what it looks like, it\u2019s all optics; Military operations have thought of everything. \n\n\n\n13. Trump won an overwhelming victory and will be the President ~ of the New Republic. \n\n\n\n14. The swamp rats needed to commit their crime during the last 4 years; and they have now been snared. \n\n\n\n15. Certifying a knowingly fraudulent election as Pence and Congress just did is treason. \n\n\n\n16. Now President Trump is still the President of the United States until January 20, 2021. He has the power to invoke the Insurrection Act. The Insurrection Act deals with treason at a military level. \n\n\n\n17. Why did the president not involve the Insurrection Act before? Because it involves the military and people would have accused him of being a dictator. He has given everybody ample opportunity to come clean with the fraudulent election: the Supreme Court, the DOJ, the courts, congress, and the vice president. They all picked their lane for the most part and chose to certify a (knowingly) fraudulent election. \n\n\n\n18. Many Trump supporters have been pressured and threatened by the deep state, they always have. People appearing to go against Trump have either been threatened or they are part of the Deep State. People have picked their lanes. \n\n\n\n19. Do not underestimate the President and this military operation. Trump often appears weak before he wins (read The Art of the Deal). Twitter and Facebook now banning (censoring) the President ~ this gives the President the opportunity to use the Emergency Broadcast System (set up in 2018) in order to contact all Americans for what they will need to hear regarding the next steps. \n\n\n\n20. Trump has said over and over: \u201cwe have it all (the evidence).\u201d He has also said: \u201cwe will never surrender.\u201d And, he said: \u201cthe best is yet to come!\u201d \n\n\n\n21. Do not watch or trust the MSM; they are deep state. Do not give up. Keep the faith!!! \n\n\n\nB. Sat. 16 Jan. Simon Parkes Update:https://www.bitchute.com/video/Kwp0JVsGkjyD/ \n\n\n\nTrump took 75% of the entire vote in the 2020 Election and even took California. \n\n\n\nTrump has not conceded. \n\n\n\nThere were 21,421 National Guardsmen surrounding Capitol Hill and the White House under President Trump as Commander in Chief. \n\n\n\nThere were no preparations in Washington DC for the Inauguration. The parade was cancelled weeks ago. \n\n\n\nOn Fri. 15 Jan. and Mon. 18 Jan. B*iden was supposed to rehearse his Inauguration and Speech, but both events were cancelled. \n\n\n\nThere would be no official inauguration. \n\n\n\nWe should expect some action by the Alliance any time from Sun. 17 Jan. and before Wed. 20 Jan. \n\n\n\nWe don\u2019t know what would really occur, though on Wed. 20 Jan. there was a real possibility that the people behind B*iden, along with the Fake News Mass Media, would create and carry a fake electronic B*iden Inauguration. \n\n\n\nIf so, within 12 hours of that broadcast the Alliance would take down the Mass Media. \n\n\n\nTrump has said, \u201cI\u2019m drafting an Executive Order to take the following propaganda media outlets off the airwaves: ABC, NBC, CBS, Fox News, CNN and MSNBC. I am also working with the FCC to pull their licenses. We have evidence that all of these media organizations employ agents of the Chinese Communist Party as well as embedded CIA Agents whose sole purpose is to brainwash, hypnotize and direct public opinion toward certain agendas that support the Left and D*eep State. These organizations are a threat to national security and virtually nothing they report is actual news.\u201d \n\n\n\nIn the days to follow Mass Arrests of treasonous political and global elites worldwide would be in full force. \n\n\n\nAs a result, power outages may occur, but they would be kept to a minimum. \n\n\n\nTV, cell phones would go down worldwide. \n\n\n\nThere would only be one TV broadcast on the air, and that would be filled with confessions of traitors who were arrested. \n\n\n\nC. Fri. 15 Jan. Zoom call with retired Generals, Colonels and Lin Wood:https://www.rumormillnews.com/cgi-bin/forum.cgi?read=163616 \n\n\n\n\u2013 25,000 troops are now in DC, under the guise of riot control for the inauguration. \n\n\n\n\u2013 More troops across the country \u2013 all major Democrat cities \u2013 are on standby which is 1hr recall. \n\n\n\n\u2013 POTUS just designated Cuba as a terrorist state (relating to election interference) \n\n\n\n\u2013 POTUS just delisted a number of Chinese companies from having business being done with them. \n\n\n\n\u2013 The recent blackouts in Italy (Vatican), Pakistan & Iran were from our Space Force \u2013 they temporarily took out parts of their power grid. This was in preparation for war with China and Iran. This isn\u2019t conventional war with tanks and bombs and bullets \u2013 it\u2019s cyber warfare including satellites that can knock out communications and data centers. If you ever wondered why the Space Force was instituted by POTUS a while back, it wasn\u2019t just about going to Mars. It was for this. Other countries have satellites up there that can do stuff to us \u2013 we have them now too. \n\n\n\n\u2013 There are now 250,000 Chinese troops surrounding us, 75,000 in Canada and the rest in Mexico. The generals said if they set foot in this country they will be wiped out swiftly as they are ready. \n\n\n\n\u2013 POTUS will be getting in front of the people to produce evidence so the people know he is the real elected President. He may have to use the Emergency Alert System to do this in 2-3 days. \n\n\n\n\u2013 The Mayor of Oklahoma City was informed by POTUS on Monday via email that the Insurrection Act has been enacted and arrests will begin in that city. This is the first of many cities. So we now have confirmation that the Insurrection Act is in place! \n\n\n\n\u2013 This election was cyber warfare on our country. A paper was sent to the White House on the voting in 4 states that showed Chinese cyber attacks moving votes from Trump to B*iden. They have proof of this. This is a foreign country involved in our elections so this has been escalated from a domestic issue to an attack from a foreign enemy. This has moved from a constitutional voting issue to a national security issue now. \n\n\n\n\u2013 Covid was a biological attack on our country to shut down our economy and push the Mail-in Ballots Nationwide in order to pull off the steal along with the Dominion Machines. The virus was a man made Bio-weapon created in a Wuhan Lab to take out as many of our elderly and the weak as possible to incite more fear globally. They needed the death counts to rise to continue their plan to take over our country. This is why every death was marked as a Cov19 death regardless if they had it or not. The Generals and Gen Flynn encouraged us all as Patriots to RESIST all across this country and yes Canada too. Take off your Mask. Go to Church and Open your businesses. They can\u2019t stop us when we all RESIST! There aren\u2019t enough jail cells to hold everyone. Those were our orders to get the message out to the masses. There is no mandate in our Constitution Law to keep people from seeing each other or close their business. \n\n\n\n\u2013 The Capitol Building attack was Antifa and BLM driven \u2013 all tactical deception as they call it in the military. \n\n\n\nThere could be blackouts, internet down, cell phones down for short periods. Make sure you have ways to keep your food cold etc. if the power goes out, and don\u2019t panic! Democrat controlled and big cities may be hit the worst because BLM & Antifa will riot and loot when B*iden isn\u2019t seated. That\u2019s why the military is on standby. \n\n\n\nI know the number of Chinese troops around us is a scary thing but they are only coming in if B*iden was seated. \n\n\n\nEverything we are hearing and seeing in the news is all optics and the corrupters are in full PANIC in DC. This war is all about implementing the new Republic in order to introduce to the World a new currency that is Gold asset backed and run on the New Quantum Financial System which replaces the Central Banks and SWIFT. 209 Countries have signed on. \n\n\n\nSOS Mike Pompeo did the Satellite tests Mon. 11 Jan. via \u201cVoice of America\u201d to all 209 Countries with over 40 languages translating in real time. This was a test to see how many Network channels would cover it and there wasn\u2019t one. \n\n\n\nThey can circumvent Big Tech to communicate with the USA and Canada (first priority) and the rest of the world using the new (EAS) Emergency Alert System. \n\n\n\nEverything they are panicked about is the world finding out about their Pedo*philia and Chi*ld Se*x Traffic*king Rings they have all profited from for decades. \n\n\n\nToday we have seen Executive orders for GA, PA, CT, UT and LA declaring them a State of Emergency for Disaster. This is for the Military to move into place which will be completed by tonight. \n\n\n\nWe may begin to see things as early as tonight Sat. 16 Jan. and we are hearing that it will become hot around the 18th-19th. \n\n\n\nD. Sat. 16 Jan. B*iden gone MAD after SHOCKING crimes of Hunter REVEALED to Bill Barr\u2019s team:https://youtu.be/y9jABGnZf98 \n\n\n\nE. Sat. 16 Jan. Rumor Mills Situation Report:https://www.rumormillnews.com/cgi-bin/forum.cgi?read=163627 \n\n\n\nConservative MP calls for nationwide rollout of vitamin D tablets, a Spanish region saw an 82% drop in covid deaths after handing out vitamin D. \n\n\n\nTrump taking more executive action to sever ties between corrupt lawmakers and Chinese-affiliated companies. \n\n\n\nDirty bomb threat for America may explain Trump\u2019s delay in taking action\u2026 have they found all the bombs yet? \n\n\n\nThe FBI, Antifa and CNN are all conspiring to create a huge number of false flag shootings at state capitols in the coming week. It\u2019s all theater. \n\n\n\nGlobal financial collapse is rapidly approaching. UK government broke. China broke. US blowing out massive debt bubble. \n\n\n\nBLM activist charged for instigating many elements of the capitol riot on Jan. 6th. \n\n\n\nCNN promoted that same activist (Sullivan) as a \u201cjournalist\u201d when he was actually complicit in the violence. \n\n\n\nCNN\u2019s Jade Sacker penetrated the Capitol with a member of BLM/Antifa cheering, \u201cWe did it!\u201d \n\n\n\nCNN was in on the entire thing, staging it just like elements of Sandy Hook which used \u201ccrisis actors\u201d posing as parents or snipers. \n\n\n\nJohn Solomon reports on Lou Dobbs that Trump ordered declass of intelligence docs from O*bamagate. \n\n\n\nFrom JustTheNews: \u201cA bombshell revelation in the remaining FBI documents on Russia collusion shows that the entire narrative was created and leaked to the news media to neutralize H*illary C*linton\u2019s concern that her email scandal hadn\u2019t gone away.\u201d \n\n\n\nFormer military personnel warn: 75,000 Chinese troop in Canada, 175,000 in Mexico, preparing to invade the USA. But US forces will destroy them quickly. \n\n\n\nUS military has long had proof of China\u2019s bioweapons attack and now cyber attack on the USA. \n\n\n\n\u201cWe are in a full blown Military Operation right now to remove the threats and install our President back in power and control the violence in the big cities.\u201d \n\n\n\nMost actions won\u2019t be evident until the very last minute, perhaps the 19th or the 20th. \n\n\n\nDiscussion of whether we are all being played by an elaborate psyop, or whether there really is a military coup under way against the deep state. \n\n\n\nMexican President announces he will lead effort to halt Big Tech censorship. \n\n\n\nUS Navy + US Coast Guard involved in searching ships off the LA / Long Beach Harbor for weapons from China, contributing to long delays for port access. \n\n\n\nTexas AG announces investigation into Big Tech for censorship. \n\n\n\nHeadline: Norwegian Medicines Agency links 13 deaths to vaccine side effects. Those who died were frail and old. \n\n\n\nCovid vaccines confirmed as depopulation \u201ceuthanasia\u201d shots for the elderly. \n\n\n\nMicrosoft, Oracle, and Salesforce pushing for \u201cvaccine credentials\u201d which they claim will \u201cempower\u201d people to \u201creturn to life.\u201d \n\n\n\nInternational Chi*ld Se*x Traffic*king Ring: \n\n\n\nChi*ld pedo*philia goes right to the top of the political elite and was also in Hollywood. Revelations of chi*ld se*x traffic*king would relate to Joe B*iden, Chief Justice John Roberts, H*illary C*linton, N*ancy P*elosi, M*ike P*ence, Jeffrey E*pstein, B*ill G*ates and thousands more. \n\n\n\nOprah Winfrey and Ellen DeGeneres have promoted skin creams made from human cells likely traumatized chi*ldren\u2019s. \n\n\n\nLin Wood said, \u201cI have video evidence of H*illary C*linton torturing and murdering a chi*ld. The video is known as Frazzle*drip and will be the end of the Democratic party. \n\n\n\nThere were ten or twelve islands by E*pstein\u2019s Pedo*phile Island that deal with chi*ld traffic*king/ chi*ld sac*rifice including ones owned by O*prah W*infrey and Joe B*iden. \n\n\n\nAs in the US, there are many underground tunnels in the UK which were actually military bases. After they rescued the people/children from them they destroyed the tunnels. That was the reason for all the sonic booms around the UK. \n\n\n\nThe Inauguration of Joe B*iden: \n\n\n\nAll Intel providers were 100% confident that Trump would remain as president. The date of when that happened didn\u2019t make a difference because the US was changing from Corporate America to the Republic of America. Trump signed the papers on July 4 2020. \n\n\n\nB*iden has been paid for by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) for over 40 years. He brought O*bama into the fold of the CCP. \n\n\n\nThere was an ongoing criminal investigation on B*iden \u2013 which actually disqualified him from running for president \u2013 but the Mainstream Media wouldn\u2019t cover it. \n\n\n\nMainstream Media, Social Media: \n\n\n\nThe Mainstream Media has committed Treason and Trump was about to do something about it. The EBS will be used for communication. In the first step Trump will broadcast a presidential message. He will see which stations will broadcast it and which won\u2019t. The ones that don\u2019t will have their licenses taken away immediately. If they stage a false inauguration of B*iden they will also lose their licenses. \n\n\n\nSince Facebook, Twitter, etc. have de-platformed a sitting president then they have committed high treason. This meant that the executives of these companies could face death by firing squad. General McInerney and others have confirmed. \n\n\n\nState Capitol Riot of 6 Jan: \n\n\n\nIn the insurrection at the Capitol on Wed. 6 Jan. there was a massive collusion with P*elosi and others with the police department. CNN was found to be complicit in the whole affair where the activists were democrat plants. \n\n\n\nFalse Flag and Bomb Scares over the next 90 days: \n\n\n\nPOTUS with DoD White Hats had the nuclear codes. Trump\u2019s team would be controlling all military missions in Cheyenne Mountain\u2019s NORAD and nearby Peterson Air Force Base\u2019s USNORTHCOM. POTUS would be moved around in secure locations across the nation to keep him safe from any more assassination attempts like that of Sat. 9 Jan. \n\n\n\nThe military White Hats standing with Trump included Secty of Defense Chris Miller, US Air Force Lt Gen. John Jay Raymond Chief of Space Force, retired US Army Lt Gen Mike Flynn as advisor, Mike Flynn\u2019s brother US Army Lt Gen. Charlie Flynn who was expected to become Army Chief of Staff on the Joint Chiefs of Staff, retired Air Force Lt. Gen. Thomas McInerney as advisor, et al. \n\n\n\nD*eep State nuclear threats would be stopped by POTUS and DoD White Hats. Bomb detonation scares: corrupt FBI & CIA operatives were planning to falsely blame Trump supporters for their FBI-CIA enabled ANTIFA-BLM false-flag attacks in DC, 50 state capitols and twelve major and 400 urban areas across the country. \n\n\n\nThe False Flag attack plans involved planting pipe bombs, SDB (small diameter bombs) or missiles shot from CIA drones https://people.com/politics/fbi-asks-help-id-violent-trump-supporters-capitol-riot/https://www.cbsnews.com/news/fbi-50k-reward-pipe-bombs-capitol-riots-rnc-dnc/ \n\n\n\nMisc: \n\n\n\nTwo different sources said that Flynn was now the Vice President replacing Pence. He was sworn in last Sat. \n\n\n\nMed Beds have been used very successfully for the traumatized children in the DUMBS. They plan to have them available to the general public by the end of Jan. When Trump had all those ventilators manufactured he was actually talking about the Med Beds. \n\n\n\nPope Francis was arrested on 80 count indictment for Chi*ld Traffic*king and fraud in March 2020. He was part of a terrorist organization many years ago before he became Pope. The Black Pope has also been arrested. There was only working staff at the Vatican right now. There was a Vatican Blackout on Jan. 10. \n\n\n\nF.

Occult Calendar of Dem*onic Holidays: \n\n\n\nSun. 17 Jan. was the Sat*anic Holiday of Sat*anic Revels according to an Occult Calendar of Dem*onic Holidays put together by professional therapists from chi*ldhood accounts of their S*atanic R*itually A*bused (SRA) clients. \n\n\n\nSat*anic Revels was celebrated with chi*ld se*xual exploitation parties filled with or*al, an*al and vag*inal attacks to females age 7 to 17. The human sac*rifice of a chi*ld, drinking their blo*od and ea*ting their fle*sh always followed these Sat*anic se*xual org*ies using chi*ld and te*en victims. \n\n\n\nBe aware of Sat*anic activities in your neighborhood and help save mind controlled chi*ldren and te*ens being forced to participate in the ra*pe, tor*ture and mur*der of other chi*ldren. Months in advance Sat*an worshippers planned for their holidays by kid*napping chi*ldren and te*ens. The victims were star*ved, tor*tured and used in se*x org*ies in preparation for human sac*rifice rites. \n\n\n\nPlease report suspected Sat*anic activities to your local law enforcement. Since Sat*anists were known to infiltrate police departments, cover your tracks by also contacting U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE): https://www.ice.gov/webform/hsi-tip-form, call the National Human Traffic*king Hotline at 1-888-373-7888 and contact the Federal Human Traffic*king Website: https://www.state.gov/humantrafficking/ \n\n\n\nIf you wished to join the effort in saving children from international se*x traffic*king, contact Tim Ballard at Operation Underground Railroad and/ or the non-profit Saving Innocence. https://ourrescue.org/https://savinginnocence.orghttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FT4tmI8YxCU&feature=emb_rel_end",

                "title": "Individuals Against the Labour Party",
                "text": "The impotence of the labour party is plain for anyone with eyes to see. \n\n\n\nStarmer, a supine and pathetic offering from the parliamentary labour party, meant to appeal to the \u2018average voter\u2019 and appease the parties base, after the inevitable defeat of Corbyn at the election; can never bridge or heal the divide that has existed within the party from its inception. It\u2019s much lauded \u2018broad church\u2019 a place for charitable masters, Fabi\u00e1n\u2019s and socialists to mingle over their next preposition for reformation; a few more crumbs for the decrepit and downtrodden, of our One Nation.  \u00a0As its role, \u2018Her Majesties Royal Opposition\u2019, the labour party has decades of history; of colonial, imperial violence, nationalism, and the quelling of working-class direct action (most notably in the 20s with striking dockers). Atlee openly condemning the 1926, General Strike. This is all during the so called, \u2018Glory Years\u2019.  \u00a0In many ways the last bulwark and bastion of capitalism, UK social democracy has time and again betrayed workers for, short-term, electoral gains, in desperate attempts to appeal as \u2018competent\u2019 technocrats to the vultures of our right wing press, which shape so much of our present day discourses, and perceptions of the world.  \u00a0As ever the party, survives off genuine revolutionary aspirations to fuel and fund its racket, and its absolutist mythos, as the only viable or credible channel for discontent. It was the militant agitation and action, taken by the post-war British working-class that resulted in an NHS, which is at present being privatised to bits; not the labour party who often use these accomplishments of direct action, and tie them to leadership figures, as an indication that liberal democracy is an effective and desirable paradigm, to live within and create change. Of course, any mention, of these struggles are relegated, and as such most of the population of the UK would tell you the NHS was made and formed, exclusively by the Labour Party.  The organisation acts as a vent for frustration, and a prettified labyrinth were anyone looking to alter present conditions might even be duped into believing that their pamphletting and harassing individuals at their doorstep, their voting, could in some ways, even have something to do with REVOLUTION.   \n\n\n\n                                                                                                            ~ \n\n\n\n In 2008, the cycle of capitalist decline and recession, gave way and paved the road for a new wave of social democracy and generalised unrest across Europe, and the world.  In Spain, Podemos, in Greece, SYRIZA and in the UK we had a revitalised party, that is still the largest social democratic party in terms of membership around Europe. The Labour Parties\u2019, \u2018Broad Church\u2019, had many new supplicants and applicants, sidling up behind their grampsy golden-calf, Jeremy Corbyn. Initials, aptly, JC. During the 2015 labour leadership hustings, after another catastrophic defeat with Ed Miliband as leader.  In between this time we\u2019d seen the largest riots since the Poll Tax in the UK, and the student demonstration, turned insurrection that took the Tory HQ in London in 2010, with a spate of occupations, riots in 2011 which started with the shooting of an unarmed black male named, Mark Duggan. There was energy and vitality, the virility of the mob, bus drivers taking a few days off while their busses, charred and burned, a sense of growing insurgency.  Fast forward, and one Corbyn later; it seems much of this latent political, and explosive energy, was channelled into this well quaffed, technocratic, new leader of the labour party. This should be of no surprise to anyone who has spent 10 minutes studying the history of leftwing politics in the UK; the disenfranchised, and their energies co-opted and used to ultimately press the political agenda of bureaucrats.  Every decade, often coinciding with crises in the present economic and ecological order, there is a new drive to fill the party with \u2018radical\u2019 ideas, every entryist from the one-thousand and ten Trotskyist fractions, that occupy these islands have purpose, once again, to publish their dull papers; and line their pockets with the pocket money afforded to workers, on universal credit. As they published tracts, about the return of a socialist labour party.  As the seemingly eternal reign of cartoonish villains, from the top-hatted Jacob Reese-Mogg, the gammon-faced Boris Johnson, and Theresa May (busy learning to speak like a person; during the Grenfell Tower tragedy), goes on with near to no resistance, and the planet continues its ecological death spiral. All this while crazed Trump supporters, storm the capitol, and a global pandemic rages.  It is time to cease mincing words. To cease, engaging in the perpetual circular spectacle of bourgeois democracy, that offers no answers, but most importantly does not even ask the right questions. Jeremy Corbyn was no Christlike figure, and no saviour. This world has none, and the next sacrificial lamb offered up by an uneasy PLP to subdue their base, will also, offer us nothing.  If our aims of a liberated world, of equity, ecological harmony are to be actualised \u2013 the labour party must be more than something we simply criticise sympathetically. It must be understood as an irreplaceable institution to the very fabric of British Class society, and as such attacked. Those \u2018anarchists\u2019 who sidled up behind the labour parties populist agenda, can be forgiven their naivety and desire to belong to a \u2018movement\u2019, as artificial as it was, which seemingly challenged capitalist domination; but ultimately curtailed genuine and organic resistance and activity, through mediums far more effective.  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As a benefit claimant, I don\u2019t want reform.

                "title": "Islamic zealotry becoming more evident among Palestinians",
                "text": "A musical event that took place at a historical site located several miles east of Jerusalem may have revealed what the Palestinians have constantly tried to hide, that is the depth of radical Islam and its role in forming their identity. \nIt is no secret that religious zealotry motivated Palestinians from all over the West Bank to rush to \u201cdefend the sanctity\u201d and emphasize the religious nature of an archeological site that was supposed to be a tourist attraction. \nMuslims have always wanted to believe that Moses\u2019s tomb is located inside the expansive building which is located in the Judean Desert, while both Jewish and Christian tradition teaches that Moses was buried in the Moab valley opposite to Beth Peor, but to this day no one knows where his grave is. \nIn a phone chat with a Catholic Palestinian deacon from Jerusalem, he blurted out that \u201cthe mosque\u2019s presence in one of the corners of the massive facility has blinded their eyes and has made them perceive it to be the new Mecca\u201d. \u201cMuslims want to deny Jewish right on the Temple Mount, and now they want to steal Moses by claiming that Moses\u2019 tomb is located there.\u201d He added.\nOne might want to ponder about the reason behind the crowds of Muslims who came from most of the Palestinian towns and villages towards the site; was it to \u201cliberate\u201d a mosque in the Judean desert when they believed that a Christmas party was being held there? (Later on, it became clear that the musical celebration had nothing to do with Christmas). \nBut the violent reactions by some Palestinians echoed images and voices visible in Mosul when the city fell to ISIS. This video of a Palestinian climbing the wall to perform the call to prayer reminded some of the akin images seen in areas that fell under ISIS control in Syria or Iraq. \nNews media reports showed that the dance party was held after the Palestinian Ministry of Tourism authorized it to promote tourism in archaeological sites under the control of the Palestinian Authority. \nBut, the arrest of DJ Sama Abdel-Hadi in Jericho, where she was detained without bail, suggested that Palestinian officials seemed so alarmed for fear of an uprising in Ramallah by angry Muslim protestors that would topple them. It became evident that the renowned Palestinian DJ was being used as a scapegoat to divert this rage against her, rather than against the officials who authorized the party.\u00a0 After a week in detention, she was released after a massive online campaign by many human rights activists was launched. \nFurthermore, a\u00a0 YouTube video showing Fatah militants threatened the Palestinian Authority officials with the ramifications showed a piece of further evidence to a rapid erosion of Abbas\u2019s authority in the face of a new Islamic tide.\u00a0 \u201cOur guns have not rusted, and our hearts are burning with fury due to the crime committed at Prophet Moses tomb, and we warn of the consequences if the officials involved are not made accountable, even if they are in the highest position.\u201d The militant read in a statement that was prepared in advance. \nWorth mentioning that these images in Bethlehem recalled similar scenes \nthat took place during the Intifadah which erupted in 2000 when Arafat resorted to the use of violence after rejecting any peace deal. \nAnother video on Facebook showing Palestinians from nearby Jerusalem chanting Islamic poetry makes viewers pay close attention to the virtual Islamic state they are longing to establish. They simply chanted for the re-establishment of the Islamic state without making any reference to any national Palestinian state. \nFurthermore, the rise of incidents of hostility towards Christians and the derision of some Muslims towards Christmas in front of the Church of the Nativity in Bethlehem signaled the great peril local Christians are living presently. This triggered a response of an Arab Israeli activist Wadie Abu Nassar who is also the Honorary Consul of Spain in Haifa, Israel to call the Palestinian President Abbas in an attempt to eliminate \u201cthese situations that reflected the Islamic resentment of what is Christian\u201d. He angrily wrote on his official Facebook page recently. \nHe posted videos of some young Muslims mocking the Christmas tree erected in Bethlehem, and others mocking the main gate of the Church of the Nativity. \nBut, the most severe incident against Palestinian Christians occurred when Muslims attempted to burn the traditional Christmas tree in Bethlehem\u2019s Manger Square on New Year\u2019s eve.\u00a0 No wonder, the Palestinian Authority exerted a tremendous effort to conceal that heinous attempt. \nEven though Palestinians claimed they sought the establishment of a Palestinian state, their rhetoric points toward a religious state that would exist as part of a new caliphate. This also explains why most of the Palestinians living under the control of President Abbas\u2019s authority cannot disguise their excitement with Turkey and its Islamic hegemony. \nSpeaking of the \u201cIslamic Emirate\u201d of Hamas in the Strip, the streets in Gaza had been adorned with billboards of Qassem Soleimani, which would make a passerby first assume to be walking in one of the wretched streets of Tehran or the southern suburbs of Beirut. Hamas \u2013 an offshoot of the Muslim Brotherhood movement \u2013 circulated last month an internal memo that sought to limit Christmas celebrations in the Gaza Strip. \n\u201cThis serves as another example of the Sunni-Shiite radical alliance when it comes to fighting the Christian infidels.\u201d Sarcastically says a former colleague of this writer who worked along at the US Department of State and nowadays spending time with his family in Lebanon. \nIn the West Bank, a Christian professor at Bethlehem University, who asked his name not mentioned due to fear of repercussions from radical Muslim students\u00a0 expressed his anger and desire to move to Canada where his children currently reside.\u201dI see that these things are getting worse day after day, and when you read the comments, one feels that ISIS has become the master of the scenario in the Palestinian street.\u201d \nThose who closely follow the Palestinian scenario note a religious euphoria and recently a sense of relief for the upcoming Biden administration, where the Palestinian Authority\u2019s coffers hope to be replenished with US tax money again. \nRecent examples of anti-Christian incitement and attacks on Christmas are indications that a Palestinian state will not be the end of the Palestinians\u2019 aspirations. \nThe Palestinian vision for establishing their own state is summarized in this video by an Islamic preacher whom the Israeli authorities have recently barred from entering Al-Aqsa due to his sermons that incite violence and terror. \nPerhaps some Muslim Palestinians, who once envisioned throwing Jews into the Mediterranean after Palestine has been liberated, might add the Christians to the mix as well. \nSamir A.

                "title": "Academy Award countdown begins\u2026",
                "text": "This is the time of year when I generally begin my Academy Award countdown.  The newspapers and magazines contain many lists of the films likely to be nominated, and I start a serious effort to see as many as possible.  In this last very strange year, all of my viewing has been online.  The line between TV productions and theatrical films has been very blurred and it looks like many films produced for Netflix, HBO, Amazon, etc. will be eligible for Oscar nominations.  Anyhow, the date for this year\u2019s awards has been pushed back 2 months to Sunday April 25, 2021. You now have 4 months to see as many films as possible.  I\u2019ll try to include mention of likely nominations whenever possible over the next 4 months.  I know that most of my friends don\u2019t take these awards nearly as seriously as I do, however, it gives us all a goal to shoot for!   \n\n\n\nHere are some viewing recommendations in the meantime including a NYT article I meant to include previously: \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStreaming\n\n\n\nWandaVision (from Disneyplus) Blends the style of classic sitcoms with the Marvel Universe in which Wanda Maximoff and Vision \u2013 two super-powered beings living their ideal suburban lives \u2013 begin to suspect that everything is not as it sees. Whackadoodle! I can\u2019t imagine what the Disney generation of watchers will make of this spoof/homage to the classic sitcoms of the 1950\u2019s and 1960\u2019s (I love Lucy, Bewitched, Dick Van Dyke, etc.) One of my children doesn\u2019t like to watch programming in black and white, so his tolerance may not last until the second episode where things gradually burst into colour. A crazy pastiche! \n\n\n\nABC\n\n\n\nThe Rookie (Season 3, 14 episodes) I must confess that I adore the charming Canadian star of this formulaic police procedural, Nathan Filion.  Oh ABC, you have become my go-to network for comfort TV. \n\n\n\nThe Good Doctor (Season 4, 8 episodes) The adventures of Shaun Murphy, surgical resident with autism.   A disease of the week show with a difference!  \n\n\n\nJeopardy hosted by Ken Jennings (aired 1964-75 hosted by Art Fleming; aired 1984-2021 hosted by Canadian Alex Trebek). I have to confess that I hadn\u2019t watched this show much in the last 30 years, but out of curiosity have now started watching it with substitute hosts and absolutely loved last week\u2019s shows with Ken Jennings, all-time show champion.  He knows the game inside and out, and although he lacks a mellifluous game show voice, he did a great job with excellent contestants last week. In comparison with much of today\u2019s dark programming, this show stands out as a beacon of light. \n\n\n\nThe View (1997-present) A panel of 4 women discuss news and politics.  OK, full disclosure, I love Joy Behar and Anna Navarro.  I despise Meghan McCain. Just watching her recent return from 3 months of maternity leave is hilariously suspenseful, as you can see her teetering on the edge of losing her shit as the only Conservative on the panel. She is a perfect model of white privilege as she daily touts her pedigree of Arizona royalty as the daughter of John McCain. I record this show daily and savour it over my lunch. George has also become addicted to it and sulks if I have watched it without him.  \n\n\n\nCBC Gem\n\n\n\nAdventures in Public School (1 h 26 m) A socially awkward home-schooled kid forces his way into pubic-school against his suffocating but loving mother\u2019s wishes. Stars the lovely Judy Greer as the mom, and has some weirdly under-utilized supporting players in Grace Park and Russell Peters.  Again, if you are looking for some light entertainment, you could do worse than this comedy. \n\n\n\nIn The Long Run (19 episodes) Produced by and starring Idris Elba. The Easmon family living in London in 1985 sees their quiet life disrupted when their relative from Sierra Leone moves in.  If you are looking for a comedy set in public housing and using over the top West African accents, this is your show!  I lasted one episode. Full of stereotypes.  \n\n\n\nAmazon Prime\n\n\n\nThe Expanse (season 5, 10 episodes) In the 24th century, a disparate band of antiheroes unravels a vast conspiracy that threatens the Solar System\u2019s fragile state of cold war. \n\n\n\nOne Night in Miami (1 h 54 m) One Night in Miami is a fictional account of one incredible might where icons Muhammad Ali, Malcolm X, Sam Cooke, and Jim Brown gathered discussing their roles in the civil rights movement and cultural upheaval of the 60\u2019s.  Talky!!  Rumored to be an Oscar nominee.  Directed by Regina King. \n\n\n\nLondon Irish (6 episodes) London Irish follows the antics of 4 ex-pat Northern Irish 20-somethings in London.  Written by Derry girl Lisa McGee, someone who knows a thing or two about \u201cthe craic\u201d in the world\u2019s best city.  These 4 friends don\u2019t find navigating their way through London life easy, especially when they\u2019re playing by rules only they get, which leads to a load of wrongdoing.  I have now watched Derry Girls, Bridget and Eamon, and now this series which all satirize the foibles of the Irish. I\u2019m simultaneously reading two books set in Ireland, The Wonder by Emma Donoghue and Snow by John Banville. Both these books are incredibly dark and require an antidote of lightness, which this series definitely provided.  \n\n\n\nApple TV Plus \n\n\n\nDickinson (Season 2, 8 episodes) An inside look at the world of writer Emily Dickinson. This blackly funny series pokes fun at an era where women were extremely limited in options. Hailee Steinfeld shines as young Emily amongst a wonderful ensemble cast that includes Jane Krakowski, Toby Huss, Finn Jones, Pico Alexander, Will Pullen, etc. I love this very wry series. \n\n\n\nCrave/HBO\n\n\n\n30 Coins \u00a0(8 episodes) An exiled priest tries to escape his demons while living in a remote village in Spain. This show is totally whackadoodle in its depiction of a good versus evil battle. Mesmerizing! \n\n\n\nYour Honor \u00a0(10 episodes) Bryan Cranston stars as a judge confronting his convictions when his son is involved in a hit and run that embroils an organized crime family. He faces impossible choices and discovers how far he will go to protect his son. \n\n\n\nThe Hunt (1 h 30 m; Hint: if you liked this, you might also like Ready or Not, another black comedy which takes the form of a terrifying game) Twelve strangers wake up in a clearing.  They don\u2019t know where they are, or how they got there.  They don\u2019t know they\u2019ve been chosen \u2013 for a very specific purpose \u2013 The Hunt.  This movie couldn\u2019t be more timely than in today\u2019s times of division between the elite class and the dispossessed.  I absolutely loved this very surprising and engaging film. \n\n\n\nI Am Burt Reynolds (1h 27 m) Burt Reynolds was the epitome of American macho.  How for his charm, his iconic mustache and penchant for women and cars. His career includes more than 200 films and TV series, a nude photo on a bearskin in Cosmopolitan, but also a fight against drug addiction due to stunt injuries. Through rarely viewed archive material and interviews with his family, friends and colleagues, an intimate portrait of one of america\u2019s most beloved stars is drawn.  \n\n\n\nHGTV\n\n\n\nAny of these shows give me the home decor fix I need to get through the day. They all inspire me, especially Home Town, which is the show with the most heart.  I can\u2019t believe how talented these people are and how they are able to make so many decisions so quickly! Full disclosure:  we have been having some updates done to our Florida home while we are away and these shows are filling a serious gap for me. \n\n\n\nFixer to Fabulous \n\n\n\nGood Bones \n\n\n\nLove it or List it Vancouver \n\n\n\nHome Town  \n\n\n\nHollywood Suite/HBOMax\n\n\n\nValley of Tears (from Israel with English subtitles, 10 episodes) On October 6th 1973, the Middle East was shaken by the biggest war it had ever seen. A war that should have been the last one, and that forever changed the region. Gripping depiction of war that conveys a sense of realism. This is the most expensive production ever filmed in Israel and had the highest ratings of any Israeli television series.  \n\n\n\nNBC\n\n\n\nMr. Mayor (13 episodes) A wealthy business man becomes the mayor of Los Angeles. Starring Ted Danson and from Tina Fey\u2019s production team.  Very cute, and no laugh track!!!  \n\n\n\nNetflix\n\n\n\nLupin (in French with English subtitles, 7 episodes, of which 5 are currently available) Inspired by the adventures of Arsee Lupin, gentleman thief.  Assane Diop sets out to avenge his father for a injustice inflicted by a wealthy family. I loved this fabulous show and watched the first 5 episodes in one seating. Well that\u2019s just me, probably. \n\n\n\nThe Sisters Brothers\u00a0(2 h 2 m) In 1850\u2019s Oregon, the infamous duo of assassins, Elis Sisters (John C. Reilly) and Charlie Sisters (Joaquin Phoenix) chase a gold prospector and his unexpected ally.  Long, tedious and incredibly violent.  Watch at your own risk! \n\n\n\n13th (1 h 40 m) An in-depth look at the prison system in the US and how it reveals the nation\u2019s history of racial inequality.  Directed by Ava Duvernay it is an eye opening look at how the justice system perpetuates the class system in America and has resulted in African Americans representing 40% of incarcerated people versus them accounting for 5% of the US population. I am currently reading Caste by Isabel Wilkerson which tells the story beneath the surface of American life. \n\n\n\nDream Home Makeover\u00a0(12 episodes) Netflix has a home improvement show with no commercials! Shea and Sad McGee of Studio McGee help dreams come true for real families looking to update their home tailored to their own unique style. Orgasmic! \n\n\n\nRoom 2806: The Accusation (4 episodes) This docuseries follows the 2011 sexual assault case involving French politician Dominque Strauss-Kahn at the height of his career. Kind of a predecessor to the Me Too movement which has featured folks like Jeffrey Epstein, Harvey Weinstein, Donald Trump, Bill Clinton, etc.  What\u2019s with these powerful men and their uncontrollable impulses? \n\n\n\nThe Last Word (in German with English subtitles, 6 episodes) While still working through her husband\u2019s recent death, a widow offers her services as a eulogy speaker.  With her fresh personality, she is soon down as a fun alternative to the other typically somber German eulogy speakers.  I love this refreshingly original series! \n\n\n\nPBS\n\n\n\nAll Creatures Great and Small (8 episodes) The numerous adventures of a friendly staff at a country veterinarian practice i 1930\u2019s to 1940\u2019s Yorkshire. A remake of the 1978-1990 series. Taken from the autobiographical books by James Herriot. I am so looking forward to the debut of this series this evening on Masterpiece Theatre. \n\n\n\nMiss Scarlet and the Duke (7 episodes) Debuts tonight on Masterpiece Mystery. Eliza Scarlet joins forces with a Scotland Yard inspector to solve crime in 19th century London.  Ooh British period mystery!  Can\u2019t wait. \n\n\n\nBlood Sugar Rising (2 h) George recorded this PBS doc quite some time ago and we finally got around to watching it.  Diabetes and pre-diabetes affect over 100 million people in the US, costing more than $325 billion each year. It\u2019s now predicted that one in three children born since 2000 will develop the disease.  Blood Sugar Rising puts human faces to these statistics, exploring the history ad science of the illness through portraits and voices of Americans whose stories she the documentary.  Together, they present a dramatic depiction of this hidden national crisis.  The two-hour special also reveals new hopes for diabetes management and prevention.  \n\n\n\nShowcase\n\n\n\nTell Me a Story (Season 2, 10 episodes) An anthology series featuring beloved fairy tales interweaving into a subversive tale of love, loss, greed, revenge and murder.  \n\n\n\nVision\n\n\n\nBorn and Bred \u00a0(36 episodes) I confess that I have a soft spot for shows set in the English countryside. This one aired 36 episodes between 2002-2005. A 1950\u2019s set, British drama series about life in the fictional Lancashire village of Ormston. The main focus of the series was the two doctors, father and son, who run the cottage hospital under the new National Health Service. A look back at a kindler, gentler time.  \n\n\n\nComic Relief\n\n\n\nThis past Friday, Real Time with Bill Maher returned with Kelly Ann Conway as his special guest.  She has the fastest mouth on TV!  Stephen Colbert, Trevor Noah, and Samantha Bee are all back.  I catch up with Seth Meyers, and James Corden on You Tube.  \n\n\n\nMoment of Zen\n\n\n\nCBS Sunday Morning (since 1979) I am about to reward myself by sitting down to my favourite weekly compendium of celebrity profiles and human interest stories. Always inspiring and informative. \n\n\n\nI also try and watch the following two Sunday morning news shows for their terrific panels of experts: \n\n\n\nFareed Zakariah GPS (CNN) \n\n\n\nFace the Nation (CBS) \n\n\n\nClosing Words\n\n\n\nGeorge has a telephone consult with his cardiologist this week to review all his test results and to determine if he can travel, so we\u2019re hoping to get back to Florida some time in the next couple of weeks.  In the meantime, we are enjoying walks around our Thornbury area.  It\u2019s a snowy day out there today, so our newly purchased crampons for walking on ice are going back on our boots.  Our next door neighbour slipped on his walkway the other day and has ended up requiring surgery for a serious injury.  The pleasures of a Canadian winter!! Please enjoy the following attachments to uplift and inspire you: \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere\u2019s the Balance Sheet of Life",

                "title": "Remember the Alamo?",
                "text": "Remember when white people defended white supremacy and slavery?\n\n\n\nSomeone told Trump that the 11,780 votes he tried to get the Georgia Secretary of State to lie about were in the  basement at the Alamo. (BTW, what Trump did in that case is a crime, just in case you\u2019re keeping track. I hope the State of Georgia prosecutes.)\n\n\n\nI was talking to a German friend about  \u2013 well, everything. \n\n\n\nShe was horrified at what was happening in the US and wanted to know how it could happen here. \n\n\n\nWhich is a fair question.  \n\n\n\nBut then you look at Chile, which went from democracy to dictatorship in the blink of an eye. And you look at Spain, which was making the transition from monarchy to democracy but got sidelined.  Argentina has alternated between democracy and dictatorship. \n\n\n\nIt can happen anywhere. \n\n\n\nBut that\u2019s not really what we\u2019re taught, is it? \n\n\n\nWhen my friend was a girl, she was taught that Hitler happened because Germans were uniquely bad. It was a shock to her to learn, when she was older, that other countries had dictators.  \n\n\n\nWhen I was a girl, I was taught that Americans were uniquely good. \u201cManifest Destiny\u201d (presented uncritically) and all that. \n\n\n\nIt was a shock to me to learn, as an adult, about the internment camps in WWII and the genocide of the Native Americans and systemic racism. \n\n\n\nThank goodness the curriculum has changed and that students in the US are now being taught something closer to the truth. I haven\u2019t seen their history books, but I know from friends that their children are being taught, for instance, about the Civil Rights movement. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRemember the Alamo? \n\n\n\nWhat were they fighting for? \n\n\n\nWhat were you taught?  \n\n\n\nI was taught, in Mr Bale\u2019s 7th grade Texas history class at Mackenzie Junior High in Lubbock, Texas, that the Texians were fighting for Freedom from the mean Mexicans. \n\n\n\nKnow what they were really fighting for? \n\n\n\nSlavery. \n\n\n\nMexico had outlawed slavery. \n\n\n\nThe Texians wanted to keep it. \n\n\n\nAll of the combatants inside the Alamo during the 1836 battle knew that they were fighting for the institution of slavery, as surely as they knew they were fighting for Mexican land. James Bowie, a slave trader and smuggler who William C. Davis says was \u201ceasily the largest land swindler of his era,\u201d had arrived in Texas in 1830 with 109 enslaved people.\u00a0 Remember the Alamo for What it Really Represents, Ruben Cordova\n\n\n\nI attended James Bowie Elementary School in Lubbock, Texas. \n\n\n\nThey closed the school last year, but not because of the name. Bowie is still being lauded. \n\n\n\nBowie Elementary School, located at 2902 Chicago Avenue, will be closed in June 2019. Bowie Elementary was first opened in 1964 and was named in honor of Texas Revolutionary war hero Jim Bowie. KFYO news\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFull story here.\n\n\n\nI\u2019m not sure where this fits in this post, but in 1989, my high school computer science teacher was assassinated by Manuel Noriega\u2019s forces in Panama. \n\n\n\nPanama was a dictatorship under Omar Torrijos when I lived there, nine years before Mr Dragseth was murdered. We knew not to mess around with the Panamanian police. We knew to be careful. \n\n\n\nBut when I was living there, on a US military base, where, I admit, I was sheltered, I don\u2019t remember hearing about people being disappeared and murdered. \n\n\n\nAt least, about Americans being disappeared and murdered. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s because it wasn\u2019t happening or because it was happening and I didn\u2019t know. We got our news from the Miami Herald, copies of which were flown to the base every day. \n\n\n\nIt\u2019s easy to ignore these things when they don\u2019t affect you directly. \n\n\n\n(Also, I was in high school, so all I cared about was that the Canal negotiations led to frequent bomb scares at school, which meant we got to leave the classrooms and hang out outdoors with our friends.) \n\n\n\nBut \u2013 the leadership of the United States knew what was going on. They knew we were in bed with a dictator. \n\n\n\nAnd they wanted to control the canal.  \n\n\n\nShrug. Whaddya gonna do? \n\n\n\n(I honestly don\u2019t have an answer to that. Strategically, the Panama Canal is essential. What do we do to ensure we have access?) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI asked my mom what she remembered about when we were in Spain \u2013 if it was known that there were political prisoners and were or had been concentration camps. \n\n\n\nShe answered, \u201cThey MIGHT have been, but there was never any discussion about it to my knowledge. We were warned not to mess with the Guardia Civil.\u201d \n\n\n\nBut the US government knew that Spain had not had free elections since before WWII. That\u2019s always a clue. \n\n\n\nAnd yet. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDid you know that the Native Americans did not get the right to vote \u2013 by federal law \u2013 until 1924?  \n\n\n\nThat wasn\u2019t even enough. Voting is regulated also at the state level. Utah was the last state, in 1962, to grant voting rights to Native Americans. \n\n\n\nI know this not because I was taught in school but because Mr T and I went to the History Colorado Center in Denver a few years ago when we were visiting my mom. This information was part of an exhibit about Native Americans who had served in WWI. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMy friend said there is a French philosopher who says that there is always a boomerang reaction to any kind of political and social progress. I don\u2019t know who she\u2019s talking about and when I google, I find only references to Michel Foucault\u00a0and I am way too lazy to dive into postmodernism. \n\n\n\nBut it makes intuitive sense \u2013 we had a Black president and we thought finally we can get past our racism but nope. \n\n\n\nTrump got elected and told the racists (yes I know not all 2016 Trump voters were racist \u2013 but man if you voted for him in 2020, you own the racism and the anti-Semitism and the anti-everything. You own it) that is was OK to be a racist. He told people it was OK to be a Nazi. \n\n\n\nDuring the insurrection, rioters surrounded and threatened a Black man. \n\n\n\nThey promptly found one: another Black man, passing through on his bicycle. He wore Lycra exercise gear and looked perplexed by what was happening on the streets. He said nothing to anybody, but \u201cBlack Lives Matter\u201d was written in small letters on his helmet. The Proud Boys surrounded him. Pointing at some officers watching from a few feet away, a man in a bulletproof vest, carrying a cane, said, \u201cThey\u2019re here now, but eventually they won\u2019t be. And we\u2019re gonna take this country back\u2014believe that shit. Fuck Black Lives Matter.\u201d Before walking off, he added, \u201cWhat y\u2019all need to do is take your sorry asses to the ghetto.\u201d Among the Insurrectionists, The New Yorker \n\n\n\nI hope every single person involved in the January 6 insurrection is caught, tried, and imprisoned. \n\n\n\nI hope Trump is escorted out of the White House in handcuffs. \n\n\n\nI hope the racist Trumpers who weren\u2019t at the insurrection \u2013 and I am talking about my former vet, my dentist (looking for a new one), other well-educated, well-off people I know, crawl back under their rocks. \n\n\n\nAnd I hope we now have a boomerang back to decency.  \n\n\n\nAnd that we can work together to eliminate systemic racism and make this country the beacon of freedom and equality and the country of good people we want it to be. The country we promised we could be.",

                "text": "According to legend, Romulus and Remus were the sons of Rhea Silvia, the daughter of King Numitor of Alba Longa, a mythical city located in the Alban Hills southeast of what would become Rome. \u00a0Numitor was deposed by his younger brother Amulius, who forced Rhea to become a vestal virgin so that she would not give birth to rival claimants to his throne.  She however, was already pregnant by the war god Mars, destined to give birth, to twins. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLearning of the birth, Amulius ordered the infants Romulus and Remus drowned in the Tiber river. The twins survived, washing ashore at the foot of the Palatine hill, where the two were suckled by a she-wolf. \n\n\n\nLater discovered by the shepherd Faustulus, the boys were reared by he and his wife. Much later, the brothers became leaders of a band of young shepherd warriors. On learning their true identity, the twins attacked Alba Longa, killed King Amulius, and restored their grandfather to the throne. \n\n\n\nRomulus and Remus founded a town on the site of their salvation, the traditional date being April 21, 753BC. Romulus later murdered his brother after some petty quarrel, making himself sole ruler of the settlement which he  modestly called \u201cRome\u201d, in his own honor. \n\n\n\nExcept, the whole story, is nonsense.  Much like a centurion with a cell phone.   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s more likely that first three hundred years were a scrap for survival.  If anyone had time to write down a serious history, it\u2019s been lost. \n\n\n\nSparse factual material was embellished by later generations with some facts exaggerated or invented outright, while the more embarrassing episodes, were \u201cdisappeared\u201d. This early or Regal period is said to be a time of six Kings, benevolent rulers all except for the seventh, a cruel tyrant known as Lucius Tarquinius Superbus.   \n\n\n\nAccording to legend, Tarquin was overthrown by public uprising, around 509/510BC.  Etruscan civilization, dominant over the Italian peninsula since 900BC, had begun to lose hold.   A series of wars would see the ascension of the Latin League (albeit temporarily), at the expense of the Etruscan league.  The siege of Veii in 396BC brought the ancient Etruscan city into the Roman orbit.   \n\n\n\nThe last remnants were absorbed in 27BC as Republic morphed into Empire, but now I\u2019m getting ahead of the story. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRather than restoring the monarchy, the Romans replaced the kingship with two annually elected magistrates, or Consuls. The Republic, was born. \n\n\n\nThe historian Livy tells us, the first 200 years of Republic was a never ending struggle between two social orders:  Patricians and Plebeians.  The privileged classes, and the common citizen.   \n\n\n\nThe republic built a governing system of three branches with checks and balances and a strong aversion to the concentration of power. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe executive branch or Consuls (usually two) were primarily Generals, whose job was to lead the republican military in war. In times of national emergency, Rome would appoint a dictator in place of Consuls, a military leader entrusted with supreme command for no more than six months. \n\n\n\nThe Senate consisted of 300 who served, for life. Primarily an advisory body, the Senate focused mostly on foreign policy but exercised considerable jurisdiction over civil affairs, as the Senate controlled the treasury. At first exclusive to ex-consuls and other members of the Patrician class, the Senate would later open to members of the Plebian class. \n\n\n\nLast came the Assemblies, the most democratic branch of Republican government, of which there were four. \n\n\n\nWithin fifteen years, the crushing debt of endless wars and the excesses of the publicani, the ruthless, usurious contractors hired by the state to collect taxes,  brought the Plebeians to open revolt.  There was talk of assassinating a Consul.  The Plebs seceded in 493BC in much the same way, as a modern labor strike.  With the economy ground to a halt, the popular ex-consul Agrippa Menenius was sent to negotiate, resulting in a direct representative of the common man, in the Assembly.  This was the Tribune of the Plebs of which there were two, and later ten. \n\n\n\nWith their physical person sacrosanct, anyone who laid a hand on them was subject to death, the Tribune of the Plebs was uniquely able to propose and veto legislation and to rescue commoners, from the hands of Patrician magistrates.  Several important offices opened to the Plebs by the 4th century BC, up to and including that of Consul, and Dictator \n\n\n\nThe working classes left the city en masse, leaving the wealthy elite, to fend for themselves.\n\n\n\nIn theory, the Tribune of the Plebs brought representation for  the common citizen.  In practice, such powers in the hands of demagogues, would bring about the death of the Republic. \n\n\n\nBy the 5th century, the people of Gaul (modern-day France, parts of Belgium, western Germany and northern Italy) migrated south to the Mediterranean coast.  Disaster struck in 390BC as war bands of the Gallic Chieftain Brennus swept out of the north, easily defeating Roman defenses at the river Allia and capturing and sacking much of Rome, itself. \n\n\n\n\nThe sack of Rome doesn\u2019t seem to have been the disaster, described in Roman legend. Little archeological evidence exists to support the idea of a sustained sack and burning of the city. Very possibly, Brennus and his band were headed south to sign on as mercenaries, in service to Dionysius of Syracuse.  \n\n\n\nMaybe all they wanted was the sort of plunder easily carried away. Like the gold they were paid to get out of town which they happily did, following a 7-month siege. \n\n\n\n\nThere followed forty years of hard fighting in Latium and Etruria to restore the power of Rome.  Be that as it may, the Gallic bogey man would live on in the Roman psyche. \n\n\n\nThe Latin war of 340-338BC ended in victory for the Republic, placing Rome in control of central Italy. The next three decades saw the conquest and colonization of the Samnites to the north and the Greek principalities, to the south. By 275BC, Rome was master of all Italy.  \n\n\n\nMeanwhile, a child was born in Carthage some 1,500 miles to the south, who would rock the Roman world. His name was Hamilcar Barca. \n\n\n\nThe 3rd century BC was a time of endless military campaign for the Roman Republic, no fewer than 68 of them. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOutward expansion inevitably brought the Republic into conflict with the other major Mediterranean power of the age, the ancient Phoenician seafaring civilization long since settled in north Africa, called Carthage.  \n\n\n\nHamilcar Barca was a great general in the first of three wars between Rome and Carthage, the longest continuous conflict and the greatest naval war, of antiquity.  The 1st Punic War went badly for Carthage and ended on harsh terms, including the loss of that famous navy.  Hamilcar died in 228BC most likely drowning in the Jucar River but he lived on in a way, in the form of the Roman\u2019s worst nightmare \u2013 Hamilcar\u2019s sons sworn to eternal hate for Rome, Hasdrubal, Mago and possibly the greatest field commander in history, the general Hannibal.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 218BC, Hannibal crossed into hostile Gaul at the head of 38,000 infantry, 8,000 cavalry, and 37 war elephants. His crossing of the Alps that winter is one of the great feats of military history, costing almost half of his force before entering Italy that December. \n\n\n\nThe first of several major battles took place on December 18, 218BC, on the banks of the Trebia River. The army of Hannibal was near invincible, defeating Roman legions in one major engagement after another. Trebia, Lake Trasimene, Cannae: where Hannibal annihilated nearly down to the man, the largest Roman army, ever assembled. For sixteen years, Hannibal\u2019s Carthaginians were virtually unbeatable, devastating the Italian countryside as Rome drafted one army after another only to see them crushed, yet again. Meanwhile, Carthage itself was politically divided. Hannibal never did receive any significant support from home. In the end, he had to leave Italy to defend his homeland in North Africa.  \n\n\n\nHannibal was soundly defeated by his own tactics on October 19, 202BC at the Battle of Zama, ending the second Punic war under humiliating terms for Carthage. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy the 1st century BC, Roman power all but encircled the Mediterranean, from modern-day Spain to Syria, from Normandy to North Africa.   \n\n\n\nSuch diverse, conquered peoples proved ever more difficult to govern as troops were stationed literally everywhere, ready to use force, if necessary. In Rome itself, citizens suffered under a government that always seemed to be looking, elsewhere. Roman made goods and produce became ever more expensive as locals found themselves unable to compete, with the provinces. Many migrated to the city where, increasingly, those in public service sought to placate the masses with handouts, and lavish entertainments.  \n\n\n\nIn the late first and early second centuries (AD), the Roman poet Juvenal spoke of the period in his Satires, of a population no longer dedicated to the sacred birthright of public service, of civic engagement, preferring instead panem et circenses. Bread and circuses. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the end, the Republic died by its own hand, a victim of internal politics.   \n\n\n\nIn the middle years of the Republic, legionaries were required to serve out entire campaigns, regardless of length. Larger homesteads could always count on the labor of slaves while smaller farms were left in the hands of wives and children. These often went bankrupt, properties bought cheaply by an increasingly wealthy and avaricious, upper class. \n\n\n\nAccording to Plutarch, \u201c[W]hen Tiberius on his way to Numantia passed through Etruria and found the country almost depopulated and its husbandmen and shepherds imported barbarian slaves, he first conceived the policy which was to be the source of countless ills to himself and to his brother.\u201d \n\n\n\nTiberius and his brother were the Gracchus brothers, important populist politicians of the late Republic. Tiberius, a hero of the 3rd Punic war, instituted reforms redistributing lands, back to the poor. Tiberius became a hero to the poorer classes and hated by the wealthy, so much so that he and 300 supporters were beaten to death with stones and clubs, in 132BC. \n\n\n\nThe Senate attempted to placate the Plebs by enforcing Gracchus\u2019 land reforms but, ten years later, Tiberius\u2019 younger brother and heir to his populist politics Gaius, would share the fate of his brother. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Gracchi were gone but the animus between Populares and Optimates, had never been greater. \n\n\n\nThe first of several civil wars began in 88BC with a struggle for power between two men. \n\n\n\nElected Consul an unprecedented seven times, Gaius Marius implemented military reforms, transforming the loyalty of the soldiery from the republic, to their commander.  Lucius Cornelius Sulla was the ambitious son of a Patrician family. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOutmaneuvered by Marius for supreme command of the 1st war against King Mithradates of Pontus (eastern Turkey), Sulla gathered his allies and marched under arms, against Rome.  It was an unprecedented act of hostility duplicated by Marius himself and his allies, on Sulla\u2019s return to Pontus.  The murderous \u201creforms\u201d of Marius and his Populares paled in comparison to the second return of Sulla and his Optimates. \n\n\n\nImagine finding your name on a list published by your government, knowing that meant you were \u201cproscribed\u201d.  Whosoever of your fellow citizens who found and killed you, was entitled to your worldly possessions.   The names of as many 4,700 \u201cenemies of the state\u201d were nailed to the wall of the Roman Forum during the \u201cproscriptions\u201d of the Dictator Sulla. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nForty years later, a General\u2019s marching on Rome at the head of an army was still an act of war, though hardly \u201cunprecedented\u201d.  With the words \u201cthe die is cast\u201d, Julius Caesar crossed the Rubicon river on January 10, 49BC, igniting another civil war.  Caesar emerged victorious in early 44BC to be appointed, \u201cDictator for Life\u201d.  The very idea was an affront to traditional Roman sensibilities.  Caesar was murdered by a cabal of Senators on March 15.  The \u201cIdes of March\u201c. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCaesar\u2019s killers believed they were saving the Republic but their actions, had the opposite effect. The assassination sparked a period of civil war and political instability from which Octavian, the adopted son of Julius Caesar, emerged victorious over Marc Antony and his Greek princess ally turned Egyptian Queen, Cleopatra. \n\n\n\nOctavian was crowned the first emperor of Rome on January 16, 27BC and given the honorific title, \u201cAugustus\u201d.  The Republic was dead. The era of Empire, had begun.",

                "text": "posted by Sundance at The Conservative Treehouse  The transparency of timing is brutally obvious.\u00a0 Yes, the far-left was willing to put millions of American\u2019s through economic pain and hardship in order to advance their interests. Last week New York Governor Andrew Cuomo\u00a0said\u00a0the economy had suddenly become more important than the threat presented by COVID-19. Too much economic damage was inflicted upon his state and now wants to re-open. Yesterday, Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot\u00a0announced\u00a0the economic damage to the service industry was so severe it was now greater than the COVID risk\u2026. and will reopen bars and restaurants.\u00a0\u00a0 Today,\u00a0a new study\u00a0shows no benefit to the lockdowns. The motives here are exactly as outlined for the past year.\u00a0 The fear of COVID was\u00a0weaponized\u00a0to damage the global economy and in doing so damage the reelection guarantee of Donald Trump. Now that mission is accomplished, the walk-back begins: [Newsweek] A new study evaluating COVID-19 responses around the world found that mandatory lockdown orders early in the pandemic did not provide significantly more benefits to slowing the spread of the disease than other voluntary measures, such as social distancing or travel reduction. The peer reviewed study, which was conducted by a group of Stanford researchers and\u00a0published in the Wiley Online Library\u00a0on January 5, analyzed coronavirus case growth in 10 countries in early 2020.  The study compared cases in England, France, Germany, Iran, Italy, Netherlands, Spain and the U.S. \u2013 all countries that implemented mandatory lockdown orders and business closures \u2013 to South Korea and Sweden, which implemented less severe, voluntary responses. It aimed to analyze the effect that less restrictive or more restrictive measures had on changing individual behavior and curbing the transmission of the virus. (more) COVID fear\u00a0was a narrative cover-story to create crisis and also hide the lack of support for Joe Biden and Kamala Harris. Part of that cover-story is needed because the MAGA community was showing up in overwhelming numbers at Biden-Harris events, and the false illusion of support -propping up the Potemkin village- was being exposed.\u00a0 All of these machinations are part of a remarkable attempt at psychological operations in this election. [SEE HERE] Everything you are witnessing right now is about psychological control to create the false illusion of reality within your own mind.\u00a0 Essentially, professional media gaslighting with an agenda and purpose.\u00a0 This is not a conspiracy theory, those who are coordinating the effort have admitted exactly what they are doing: \u2666 Google executives are on camera, outlining what their organization is doing.\u00a0\u00a0HERE\u00a0and\u00a0HERE\u00a0and\u00a0HERE.\u00a0\u00a0 Google has admitted to using algorithms and their control over the internet search engine to influence the election.\u00a0 Again, stop and think about that. \u2666 General Stanley McCrystal was working with a SuperPAC to use psychological warfare against the American electorate.\u00a0\u00a0 Even the\u00a0Washington Post admitted: [\u2026] The group, Defeat Disinfo, will use artificial intelligence and network analysis to map discussion of the president\u2019s claims on social media. It will seek to intervene by identifying the most popular counter-narratives and boosting them through a network of more than 3.4 million influencers across the country \u2014 in some cases paying users with large followings to take sides against the president. (source) \u2666 The national U.S. media has been caught numerous times constructing a false reality, lying about events and attempting to manipulate the election.\u00a0 As you read this you have the concrete example of all national media hiding the explosive issues around Hunter and Joe Biden.\u00a0\u00a0 Again, these are not conspiracy theories, these are demonstrable facts. So what were all of these aligned interests trying to do with the media polling examples they push and promote so heavily?\u00a0 Answer: they were trying to create a self-fulfilling prophecy; same with the COVID-19 fear narrative. However, the actual facts on the ground\u2026 the stuff you can see around you, with your own eyes and ears,\u2026 is entirely different from the false reality they created in the internet and false reality of television.\u00a0 Thus, why the same media and tech entities are now banning any speech that would outline their big lie.",

                "text": "Photographed\u00a0 by\u00a0 Tyler Mitchell\u00a0 Vice-President-Elect Kamala Harris\u00a0 appeared on the\u00a0 cover of Vogue \u00a0wearing\u00a0 \u00a0her own clothes sneakers,\u00a0 and a pair of converse which\u00a0 was controversial. \n \n\u00a0 \n\n\nTyler Mitchell\u00a0 is acknowledged\u00a0 by the Vogue team as one of the youngest talents on the scene. Mitchell has\u00a0 photographed Beyonce for American Vogue as a cover by the youngest ever photographer, who also happened to be African American. While the race might for many have no importance, Vogue has faced multiple accusation of working only with white cis male photographers, the accusations are circle around for years now. The Harris cover is meant to be one of Vogue\u2019s proudest moments in years, and Wintour herself has talked about the shoot prior to the release with New York Times journalist Kara Swisher for her widely popular podcast SWAY. The podcast recorded days earlier premiered yesterday and Swisher talks about the process behind creating this shoot with Wintour. Swisher reached out to Wintour for a statement regarding the cover controversy, and got the following response: \n\u00a0 \n\u00a0 \n\u00a0 \u201cObviously I heard and understood the reaction to the print cover. I just want to reiterate that it was absolutely not our intention to in any way diminish the importance of the Vice President Elect\u2019s incredible victory. We want nothing but to celebrate Vice President Elect Harris\u2019 amazing victory and the important moment this is in America\u2019s history and particularly for women of colour all over the world.\u2018 \nAnna Wintour also addressed the magazine\u2019s choice of the cover, now accompanied by another digital cover expected to go to print in February 2021 issue\u2019s second print run:\u00a0 \u201cThere was no formal agreement about what the choice of the cover would be, and when the two images arrived at Vogue, all of us felt very very strongly that the less formal portrait of the Vice President elect really reflected the moment that we were living in. Which we are in the midst. As we still are of the most appalling pandemic that is taking lives by the minute and we felt to reflect this tragic moment in global history a much less formal picture something that was very accessible and approachable and real. Really reflected the hallmark of the Biden Harris campaign and everything that they are trying to and I am sure will achieve.\u201d \nSwisher talks in length to Wintour about the cover shoot as well as the political situation in the states right now. Even addressing President Trump\u2019s tweets about Vogue not putting Melania on the cover, Wintour reacted only with: \u201cPresident Trump is no longer relevant.\u201d \nMid December Conde Nast has revealed it\u2019s massive shake up, with editorial changes in Europe of their German and Spanish titles and the new roles for Edward Enninful and Anna Wintour. With the repositioning in Conde Nast\u00a0Anna Wintour became worldwide chief content officer and global editorial director of Vogue. While Edward Enninful got additional roles as the head of Vogue\u2019s editions in Britain (already in charge of), France, Italy, Germany and Spain. \n\n\n\nI just want to reiterate that it was absolutely not our intention to in any way diminish the importance of the Vice President Elect\u2019s incredible victory. \nEarlier in 2020 Ms Wintour also had to address racism in Vogue offices, the headlines spearheaded by media but also\u00a0by a piece from New York Times, quoting: \u201cMany of the people interviewed for this article said the racism they encountered was usually subtle, but sometimes blunt. Their main accusation was that Ms. Wintour created a work environment \u2014 and there is no facet of Vogue that she does not control \u2014 that sidelined and tokenized women of color, especially Black women.Many Black people who worked for her said they felt so out of place in Ms. Wintour\u2019s domain that they created white alter egos \u2014 two used the term \u201cdoppelg\u00e4nger\u201d \u2014 just to get through the workday, reconditioning their presentation and dress in a way that was mentally draining.\u201c \n\u00a0 \nWintour talks also British politics with Swisher, what was happening at Conde Nast in 2020 and much more, you can listen to the full Sway by Kara Swisher podcast on Spotify and NYT. \nThe post Anna Wintour Addresses Kamala Harris VOGUE Cover appeared first on Fashionsizzle.",

                "text": "REPORT \n\n\n\nSexual violence strikes Spanish politics again, as former far-right Vox MP, Carlos Fern\u00e1ndez-Roca Su\u00e1rez, is investigated for a sexual offence. On 13th\u00a0November 2020 Fern\u00e1ndez-Roca announced his resignation from Spain\u2019s Parliament using a now-deleted Twitter account, following the accusation: \u2018On Wednesday, after learning of the complaint made against me, I immediately and voluntarily made myself available to the police. Although I am innocent, I renounced my seat in Parliament on Thursday morning.\u2019 Fern\u00e1ndez-Roca also resigned from his posts as Vox spokesperson on the National Security Committee and on the Foreign Affairs and European Union Committee. \n\n\n\nAccording to the complaint lodged by a young woman in her early twenties, the assault took place on the night of Saturday 7th\u00a0November. According to InfoLibre, sources close to the investigation have revealed that the alleged victim was a Professor of Religion, who held personal ties to Vox at the time of the alleged crime, and had met Fern\u00e1ndez-Roca on several prior occasions. He is alleged to have taken advantage of her inebriated state and had sex with her whilst she was unable to consent. \n\n\n\nUpon announcing his resignation, Fern\u00e1ndez-Roca was met with much support from those within his party. Iv\u00e1n Espinosa de los Monteros, who is second only in the party to leader Santiago Abascal, commended Fern\u00e1ndez-Roca\u2019s \u2018exemplary reaction\u2019 to the accusation and wished him \u2018much courage\u2019. That the ex-MP can still count on the support of Vox is not surprising, given the far-right party\u2019s track record on issues of gender violence. Vox has expressed vehement opposition to the so-called \u2018only yes means yes\u2019 proposed change to Spain\u2019s controversial rape laws, which was passed by government in March 2020. Fern\u00e1ndez-Roca is not the first sitting member of Parliament for Vox who has had to resign over accusations of sexual violence. In February 2020, Juan Ros Alcaide, the Vox Senator for Ceuta, resigned from his position after facing allegations of domestic violence against his wife. \n\n\n\nOther members of Spanish Parliament did not hesitate in expressing their condemnation of the alleged sexual assault. The spokesperson for the Socialist Party, Adriana Lastra, tweeted on the 16th\u00a0December: \u2018His name is Carlos Fern\u00e1ndez-Roca, MP for VOX. He resigned without explanation. He is accused of sexually assaulting a girl who was left bleeding. It is shameful and painful that someone like that has had a seat in Congress.\u2019",

                "text": "Covid-19 Live Updates: World Braces for Surge of Virus VariantsIndia, which has the world\u2019s third-highest virus death toll, has begun vaccinating its population of 1.3 billion. Vaccinations in U.S. nursing homes are going more slowly than expected. Countries are bracing for the impact of more contagious virus variants.A woman wearing a face mask is reflected in a shop window in Lisbon on Friday, as Portugal entered a new lockdown over a surge in coronavirus cases.Credit...Patricia De Melo Moreira/Agence France-Presse \u2014 Getty Images\u00a0  January 16, 2021 The more contagious coronavirus variant discovered in Britain has now been detected in more than 50 countries, including Argentina on Saturday, and is believed to be driving surges in at least two. But how widely that version of the virus has actually spread \u2014 and whether it could already be a factor in other countries\u2019 surges \u2014 may not be clear for some time, because the necessary genomic testing remains rare. And at least three other troubling variants are spreading less widely, according to available data: one identified in South Africa and\u00a0two in Brazil. Britain, one of Europe\u2019s worst-hit countries during the pandemic, leads the world in identifying the exact genetic sequence of virus samples, known as genomic surveillance.\u00a0That capacity enabled it to put the world on notice\u00a0with an announcement on Dec. 14 that it had detected the variant scientists call B.1.1.7, along with the disturbing news that it was most likely the cause of skyrocketing infections in London and the surrounding area. That version of the virus, which has been widely referred to as \u201cthe U.K. variant,\u201d though its origin is unknown, has so far left the most evident trail. It is believed to have helped push Ireland\u2019s positivity rate past Britain\u2019s to become\u00a0the third highest in the world\u00a0\u2014 over just a few weeks. Antoine Flahault, the director of the\u00a0Institute of Global Health\u00a0in Geneva, said the variants were causing concern all over Europe. He said that several countries were now trying to put in effect more frequent and systematic sequencing to get a clearer picture of their impacts. None of the variants is known to be more deadly or to cause more severe disease, but increased transmissibility adds to caseloads that further strain hospitals and result, inevitably, in more deaths. Their emergence adds to the urgency of mass vaccination campaigns, which have had troubled starts in Europe and the United States; are only beginning in many other countries, like India; and are at minimum months away in many others. Dr. Emma Hodcroft, a molecular epidemiologist at the University of Bern in Switzerland, said that outside of Britain and Ireland, scientists remained cautious about linking recent surges in Europe to B.1.1.7. \u201cFor most of Europe, the expected prevalence of the variant is still under 5 percent \u2014 likely too small to be making a big difference in case numbers,\u201d she said. \u201cWe do not need new variants to see increase in cases,\u201d Ms. Hodcroft added. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen many, many surges in cases around the world that we can confirm did not seem to be associated with variants.\u201d The timing of the variant\u2019s spread is a crucial question for countries like Portugal, which has found fewer than 80 cases of B.1.1.7 but has a fragile health care system that could be easily overwhelmed. In the last seven days, its infection rate has been among the world\u2019s highest, with an average of more than 8,800 new infections, or 86 per 100,000 people. On Saturday, the country reported nearly 11,000 cases and 166 deaths, its worst day of the pandemic. The authorities imposed a monthlong lockdown on Friday. Many countries expect that B.1.1.7\u2019s impact still lies ahead. That is a disturbing possibility in the United States, which has long had the world\u2019s largest coronavirus outbreak and is in the midst of a post-holiday surge. On Friday, federal health experts warned in dire terms that B.1.1.7 would most\u00a0likely be the dominant source of infection in the country by March. Nearly 20 European countries have found B.1.1.7 so far. In Denmark on Saturday, the authorities said more than 250 cases had been detected in samples taken since November. The country\u2019s health minister has predicted that the variant will predominate by mid-February. The country\u2019s coronavirus monitor also reported that it had identified a case of the variant found in South Africa,\u00a0Reuters reported. Many countries in Europe are redoubling their efforts at mitigation. A nationwide 6 p.m. curfew went into effect in France on Saturday, and the authorities have warned that they could reimpose strict lockdown measures. Scotland tightened already strict restrictions, including banning drinking outside and barring customers from stepping inside establishments to buy takeaway food or coffee.\u00a0Britain and Germany have closed schools. In a stark contrast, the authorities in Spain have refused to impose a new nationwide lockdown, arguing that the recent discovery of dozens of cases of the variant were not to blame for a record surge in infections. On Saturday, Britain reported eight cases of one of the variants found in Brazil, hours after British authorities imposed a travel ban from Latin American countries and Portugal, which is tied to Brazil by its colonial history and by current travel and trade ties. Italy also suspended flights from Brazil, its health minister,\u00a0Roberto Speranza, announced on Facebook. A leading epidemiologist said that a second variant discovered in Brazil was most likely already present in Britain. \u201cWe are one of the most connected countries in the world, so I would find it unusual if we hadn\u2019t imported some cases into the U.K.,\u201d Professor John Edmunds, a member of a group of scientists advising the government on the pandemic, said about the second variant, which was found in the Brazilian city of Manaus. India begins inoculating its 1.3 billion people, starting with health care workers.PUNE, India \u2014 India on Saturday began one of the most ambitious and complex initiatives in its history: the nationwide rollout of\u00a0coronavirus vaccines\u00a0to 1.3 billion people, an undertaking that will stretch from the perilous reaches of the Himalayas to the dense jungles of the country\u2019s southern tip. The campaign is unfolding in a country that has reported more than 10.5 million coronavirus infections,\u00a0the second-largest caseload after the United States, and 152,093 deaths, the world\u2019s third-highest tally. Prime Minister Narendra Modi kicked off the vaccine drive on Saturday with a live television address as 3,000 centers nationwide were set to inoculate a first round of health care workers. \u201cEveryone was asking as to when the vaccine will be available,\u201d Mr. Modi said. \u201cIt is available now. I congratulate all the countrymen on this occasion.\u201d The government had hoped to inoculate about 300,000 people on Saturday, but government data showed that 165,000 people received a shot. The plan is to give the vaccine to millions more health care and frontline workers by the spring. At Kamala Nehru Hospital in Pune, a city of about 3.1 million southeast of Mumbai, 100 long-stemmed red roses were stacked neatly on a table beside a bottle of hand sanitizer. Each person registered to receive the Covishield vaccine, developed by AstraZeneca and Oxford University and manufactured by the Pune-based Serum Institute of India, was to get a rose. Covishield and another vaccine called Covaxin were authorized for emergency use in India this month. Neither Covaxin\u2019s manufacturer, Bharat Biotech, nor the Indian Council of Medical Research, which contributed to the vaccine\u2019s development, has published data proving that it works. In a Covaxin consent form at District Hospital Aundh, one of a handful of sites in Pune where the vaccine was being administered, the manufacturer noted that clinical efficacy was \u201cyet to be established.\u201d Dr. Rajashree Patil, one of the health workers who received the Covishield vaccine at Kamala Nehru Hospital, said she was both excited and nervous. After contracting the coronavirus while working in the government hospital\u2019s emergency room in May, she spent 12 days in a Covid ward at another hospital, having lost her senses of smell and taste and experiencing extreme fatigue. \u201cI\u2019m a little bit worried. Actually we\u2019re on a trial basis,\u201d Dr. Patil said. \u201cBut I am happy we are getting it so we can one day be corona-free.\u201d Another doctor who received the Covishield vaccine at that hospital, Usha Devi Bharmal, said that she had wanted to get a shot to dispel people\u2019s fears about coronavirus vaccines. \u201cThere are rumors on social media,\u201d she said, adding that she hoped to help show that vaccines are a \u201cpositive thing.\u201d Mr. Modi has pledged to inoculate 300 million health care and frontline workers, including police officers and, in some cases, teachers, by July. But so far the Indian government has purchased only 11 million doses of Covishield and 5.5 million doses of Covaxin. Indian television stations showed Dr. Randeep Guleria, the director of the All India Institute of Medical Sciences in New Delhi and a prominent government adviser on Covid-19, receiving a jab on Saturday. It was unclear whether Mr. Modi was vaccinated. India\u2019s rollout, among the first in a major developing country, comes as millions of people in the United States, Britain, Israel, Canada and the European Union have\u00a0received at least one dose. India\u2019s vaccination effort faces a number of obstacles, including a growing sense of complacency about the coronavirus. After reaching a peak of more than 90,000 new cases per day in mid-September, the country\u2019s official infection rates have dropped sharply. Fatalities have fallen about 30 percent in the last 14 days, according to a\u00a0New York Times database. City streets are buzzing. Air and train travel have resumed. Social distancing and mask-wearing standards, already lax in many parts of India, have slipped further. That alarms experts, who say the real infection rate is probably much worse than official numbers suggest. A fast-spreading variant could become the dominant source of infection in the U.S. by March, C.D.C. says.Drivers were directed to a coronavirus testing site at Dodger Stadium last week in Los Angeles.Credit...Philip Cheung for The New York TimesEven as President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr. makes public his ambitious plans to tame Covid-19, a far more contagious variant of the virus is causing researchers to fear that another wrenching surge of cases and deaths is looming. Federal health officials sounded the alarm on Friday about the fast-spreading variant, which was first identified in Britain. They warned that it could become the dominant source of infection in the United States by March. \u201cI think we are going to see in six to eight weeks major transmission in this country, like we\u2019re seeing in England,\u201d said Dr. Michael T. Osterholm, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota and a member of Mr. Biden\u2019s coronavirus advisory board. In a\u00a0study released Friday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention called for a doubling down on preventive measures to fight the variant, including more robust distribution of vaccines, which remain far below the benchmarks the government has set. Tweeting on Friday that his administration \u201cwill move Heaven and Earth\u201d to get more people vaccinated as soon as possible, Mr. Biden was still sober about his plans for broadening\u00a0vaccine distribution\u00a0even as supplies remain limited. He said he would create mobile vaccine clinics and widely \u2014 and equitably \u2014 expand access to the shots across the country. The variant, though it spreads more rapidly, is not known to be more deadly or to cause more severe disease. But\u00a0further study is needed, the C.D.C. says, to determine whether existing vaccines and treatments will be effective in treating the variant \u2014\u00a0as well as others\u00a0that have been discovered in Brazil and South Africa. As of Friday, the variant first discovered in Britain had been detected in more than 70 cases from 13 states \u2014 most recently in Oregon \u2014 but the actual numbers are likely to be much higher, said Dr. Jay Butler, deputy director for infectious diseases at the C.D.C. \u201cI want to stress that we are deeply concerned that this strain is more transmissible and can accelerate outbreaks in the U.S. in the coming weeks,\u201d Dr. Butler said. \u201cWe\u2019re sounding the alarm and urging people to realize the pandemic is not over and in no way is it time to throw in the towel.\u201d \u201cWe know what works, and we know what to do,\u201d he said. Current spikes in cases threaten to cripple already overwhelmed hospitals and nursing homes in many parts of the country. Some are at or near capacity. Others have faced troubling rates of infection among their staff, causing shortages and increasing patient loads. Covid-19 cases and deaths have broken record after record across the country, with a peak number of deaths, 4,400, announced on Tuesday. More than 3,740 new deaths and at least 241,000 new cases were reported on Friday, and the nation is nearing a milestone of 400,000 deaths. And with the possibility that yet another surge from the new variant will overtake the country\u2019s ability to inoculate enough people to stamp out the virus altogether anytime soon, it will be awhile before people can relax their guard. \u201cThe honest truth is this: things will get worse before they get better,\u201d Mr. Biden said. \u201cAnd the policy changes we are going to be making, they\u2019re going to take time to show up in the Covid statistics.\u201d Biden and Harris introduced key members of their science team.President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr. delivers a speech announcing the White House science team in Wilmington, Del. on Saturday.Credit...Amr Alfiky/The New York TimesPresident-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr. said on Saturday that he was \u201calways going to lead with science and truth\u201d as he announced top science and technology officials on his White House staff, reaffirming trust in the kind of expert research that the Trump administration often ignored or disdained. \u201cThis is how we are going to, God willing, overcome the pandemic and build our country back better than it was before,\u201d he said on Saturday while announcing the top members of his White House science team. Extolling what he called \u201csome of the most brilliant minds in the world,\u201d Mr. Biden said his new team\u2019s mission would be to ask: \u201cHow can we make the impossible possible?\u201d The team includes Eric S. Lander, Alondra Nelson, Frances H. Arnold and Maria Zuber. Mr Biden described the scientists as \u201csome of the most brilliant minds in the world.\u201d Mr. Biden will nominate Mr. Lander to be director of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy, a position that will for the first time\u00a0hold cabinet rank. Mr. Biden also said that\u00a0Dr. Francis S. Collins\u00a0would remain as the director of the National Institutes of Health. On Friday, Mr.\u00a0Biden\u00a0pledged to increase vaccination availability in pharmacies, build mobile clinics to get vaccines to underserved rural and urban communities, and encourage states to expand vaccine eligibility to people 65 and older. He also vowed to make racial equity a priority in fighting a virus that has disproportionately infected and killed people of color. The coronavirus pandemic is just one aspect of science in America that the team has been tasked with working on in the coming years. Others include economic prosperity, how science can help confront the climate crisis, ensuring that the U.S. leads the way in tech and industries critical for future development, and finally, building long term health and trust in science and technology among Americans. Although neither Mr. Biden nor Vice President-elect Kamala Harris mentioned President Donald J. Trump by name, they drew comparisons to the current administration\u2019s handling of the pandemic and decisions to ignore scientists and research. Ms. Harris said that her mother taught her the importance of \u201cmaking decisions, not based on intuition or ideology, but based on evidence.\u201d The Trump administration repeatedly rejected guidance from government scientists on issues including climate change and the pandemic. President Trump left the position of science adviser unfilled for 18 months. \u201cThe science behind climate change is not a hoax,\u201d Ms. Harris said. \u201cThe science behind the virus is not partisan. The same laws apply. The same evidence holds true regardless of whether or not you accept them.\u201d People in the U.S. are frustrated over the pace of vaccinations at long-term care facilities.Pharmacists from CVS prepared to administer Covid-19 vaccines to nursing home residents in Harlem on Friday.Credit...Yuki Iwamura/Associated PressAlex M. Azar II, the secretary of health and human services,\u00a0suggested in December\u00a0that all nursing home residents in the United States could be vaccinated against the coronavirus by Christmas. A month later, vaccinations of some of the country\u2019s most vulnerable citizens\u00a0are going more slowly\u00a0than many state officials, industry executives and families expected. Their hopes had been buoyed when government officials said long-term care facilities would be at the front of the line for vaccines. \u201cI\u2019ve had facilities call me, and I\u2019ve had people cry,\u201d said Betsy Johnson, who leads\u00a0a group\u00a0that represents Kentucky\u2019s nursing homes and assisted living facilities. \u201cI\u2019ve had people curse.\u201d The pace of vaccination has taken on greater urgency as the virus continues to decimate nursing homes and similar facilities. The virus\u2019s surge since November has killed about 30,000 long-term care staff members and residents, raising the total of virus-related deaths in these facilities to at least 136,000,\u00a0according to a New York Times tracker. Since the pandemic began, long-term care facilities have accounted for just 5 percent of coronavirus cases but 36 percent of virus-related deaths. CVS and Walgreens, which are largely responsible for vaccinating residents and workers in long-term care facilities, are on track to make at least initial vaccination visits to nearly all nursing homes they are working with by Jan. 25. The two pharmacy chains have already given out more than 1.7 million vaccine doses at long-term care facilities. But progress is uneven across the country. Thousands of assisted living facilitiesdo not yet have appointments for their first visit from the pharmacy teams. In some states, teams from CVS or Walgreens are not scheduled to visit some nursing homes or long-term facilities until February. Although vaccinations by CVS and Walgreens were always expected to take several months because of the need to visit facilities three times, a growing number of governors and state health officials have voiced frustration with the pharmacies\u2019 speed. Some states and cities are exploring ways to hasten inoculations. \u201cThis isn\u2019t a drive-through or stadium vaccination effort,\u201d said T.J. Crawford, a spokesman for CVS. \u201cWe\u2019re visiting more than 40,000 facilities with an average of less than 100 residents, in some cases going room to room.\u201d Representative Lou Correa tests positive for the virus after the Capitol attack.Representative Lou Correa, Democrat of California, at a House hearing in July. He plans to skip the inauguration after testing positive.Credit...Pool photo by Matt McClainRepresentative Lou Correa, Democrat of California, announced on Saturday that he had tested positive for the coronavirus a day earlier, becoming the latest lawmaker to contract the virus in the first two weeks of the 117th Congress. Mr. Correa,\u00a0who disclosed his test results on Twitter, gave few details about his symptoms, but he said he would \u201cbe responsible & self-quarantine, away from my family, for the recommended time.\u201d He was at the Capitol during last week\u2019s siege by a\u00a0pro-Trump mob, but was not among the lawmakers corralled into secure rooms with some of the Republicans who refused to wear masks, an action that has created concerns of\u00a0a super-spreader event. According to a statement from his office, he stayed outside and tried to help the Capitol Police. But Mr. Correa was\u00a0among the lawmakers on the House floor\u00a0who voted to impeach President Trump for a second time after the siege. The day after, he\u00a0was accosted\u00a0by Trump supporters at Dulles International Airport. He later told CNN that he was surprised that security was not tighter. Mr. Correa received one dose of the Pfizer vaccine on Dec. 19, according to a statement from his office. At least three Democratic lawmakers tested positive after sheltering in place, and all blamed the unmasked Republicans. Representative Ayanna S. Pressley, Democrat of Massachusetts, also cited Republicans after her husband, who was with her during the riot, tested positive. And Representative Adriano Espaillat, Democrat of New York,\u00a0announced on Thursday\u00a0he had also tested positive, but it was unclear whether he took shelter in the secure room. Capitol Hill has long struggled to\u00a0curtail the spread of the virus, with haphazard guidance and a failure to enforce and adhere to a uniform set of health protocols across both chambers and the complex. After the riot, the House enacted a fine system for those who refuse to wear masks in the House chamber.

Nepal approved the vaccine on Friday.Credit...Atul Loke for The New York TimesNepal has granted emergency approval for a vaccine. Now comes the hard part: rolling out an inoculation drive in a Himalayan country dotted with remote mountain villages. Nepal\u2019s Drug Administration Authority on Friday approved the Covishield vaccine, which was developed by AstraZeneca and Oxford University and manufactured by the Serum Institute of India. Hridayesh Tripathi, the health minister, said on Saturday that vaccines for 20 percent of the country\u2019s 30 million people would arrive by early March. Two other manufacturers \u2014 Sinopharm of China and Bharat Biotech of India \u2014 have also applied for regulatory approval of their vaccines in Nepal. China and India, Nepal\u2019s two powerful neighbors, have long\u00a0jockeyed for influence in the country. Nepal has said that it will inoculate 40 percent of its population for free, starting with health care workers and people over 55. Mr. Tripathi said on Saturday that officials were considering whether to later allow private hospitals to vaccinate people who can afford to pay a fee. Health officials in Nepal say they have established 16,000 vaccination centers, with equipment to store vaccines at cold temperatures. But bringing those vaccines to remote areas \u2014 tucked into iceboxes \u2014 may prove challenging. Heavy snowfall in the depths of the Himalayas often blocks traffic, and some villages are not connected to a national road network. Even in good weather, it can take days to reach people who live in the farthest-flung areas. \u201cAlthough we use refrigerated vans to transport vaccines to provinces and districts, there might be some difficulties in ferrying vaccines to remote villages from district cold centers,\u201d said Dr. Shyam Raj Upreti, a member of the government\u2019s vaccine advisory committee. Further complicating the situation, Nepal is currently in political turmoil, weeks after Prime Minister K.P. Sharma Oli dissolved\u00a0the lower house of Parliament, and its tourism-dependent economy is suffering from an acute crisis. In other developments around the world: China\u2019s National Health Commission said on Saturday that it had recorded 130 new coronavirus cases, all but 15 of them locally transmitted, a day after it said that more than 1,000 people nationwide were being treated for Covid-19. The authorities in Nangong, a city in the hard-hit northern province of Hebei, also said on Saturday that they had finished the building the first of six coronavirus hospitals. Hospitals across\u00a0England\u00a0are stretched to the brink with Covid-19 patients, medical workers are at their breaking point, and the death toll is soaring. The number of hospitalized Covid-19 patients in England has risen sharply since Christmas and now dwarfs the spring peak by 70 percent, with almost 14,000 more patients in hospitals than on April 12. Prime Minister Boris Johnson warned this week that there was a \u201cvery substantial\u201d risk that many hospitals will soon run out of beds in intensive-care units. South Korea\u00a0said on Saturday that it would\u00a0extend social distancing restrictions\u00a0in and around Seoul, the capital, for another two weeks. The rules ban private gatherings of five people or more and restrict business operations after 9 p.m. AstraZeneca\u2019s Covid-19 vaccine became the first to be approved for emergency use by\u00a0Pakistan,\u00a0Reuters reported on Saturday, citing the country\u2019s health minister.

No proof needed.A vaccination center in Teaneck, N.J., this week.Credit...James Estrin/The New York TimesFaced with soaring rates of coronavirus infections and more doses of vaccine in freezers than in arms, New Jersey officials made a calculated choice. They opened the floodgates of vaccine eligibility on Thursday to about 4.5 million additional residents: those 65 and older and younger people with\u00a0underlying health problems,\u00a0including cancer, heart conditions and diabetes \u2014 diseases that can lead to severe complications from Covid-19. As part of the expansion, New Jersey also became the second state in the country to open vaccinations to another high-risk group: smokers. As is true for all Covid-19 vaccinations in New Jersey, no documentation of an underlying health condition is required. The announcement came a day after the Trump administration told states to\u00a0expand eligibility\u00a0and to quickly use existing vaccine or risk losing future allocations. New Jersey\u2019s decision to immediately adopt all of the\u00a0recommendations\u00a0by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for priority vaccination puts these groups ahead of some essential workers \u2014 including teachers. The move has contributed to a sense of confusion and anger among those who now find themselves further back in the line for inoculation. It has also expanded competition for shots at a time when many people in the first priority groups continue to have trouble making appointments and navigating the\u00a0overburdened\u00a0scheduling systems of vaccine clinics. \u2014\u00a0Tracey Tully\u00a0and\u00a0Kevin Armstrong",

                "title": "Peer-Reviewed Study \u201cDid Not Find Evidence\u201d Lockdowns Were Effective In Stopping COVID Spread",
                "text": "Via ZeroHedge \nLiberals may be able to argue with Fox News or even Republican politicians. But what happens when a peer reviewed study comes out of one of their coveted and prestigious universities in California potentially showing that their collective reaction to Covid may have been completely worthless and, as a result, may have done exceptionally more harm than good? \nAlong those lines, it seems like a good idea to point out that a\u00a0new peer reviewed study out of Stanford is questioning the effectiveness of lockdowns and stay-at-home orders (which it calls NPIs, or non-pharmaceutical interventions)\u00a0to combat Covid-19. The study\u2019s lead author is an associate professor in the Department of Medicine at Stanford. \n \n\u201cThe study did not find evidence to support that NPIs were effective in preventing the spread,\u201d according to Outkick, who published the report. \nThe study,\u00a0co-authored by Dr. Eran Bendavid, Professor John P.A. Ioannidis, Christopher Oh, and Jay Bhattacharya, studied the effects of NPIs in 10 different countries, including England, France, Germany and Italy. \nAnd, when all was said and done, it concluded that: \u201cIn summary, we fail to find strong evidence supporting a role for more restrictive NPIs in the control of COVID in early 2020.\u201d \nIn fact, the study found\u00a0\u00a0\u201cno clear, significant beneficial effect of more restrictive NPIs on case growth in any country.\u201d \n \nFrom the study: \n\u00a0 \n\u201cIn the framework of this analysis, there is no evidence that more restrictive non-pharmaceutical interventions (\u201clockdowns\u201d) contributed substantially to bending the curve of new cases in England, France, Germany, Iran, Italy, the Netherlands, Spain, or the United States in early 2020. By comparing the effectiveness of NPIs on case growth rates in countries that implemented more restrictive measures with those that implemented less restrictive measures, the evidence points away from indicating that more restrictive NPIs provided additional meaningful benefit above and beyond less restrictive NPIs. While modest decreases in daily growth (under 30%) cannot be excluded in a few countries, the possibility of large decreases in daily growth due to more restrictive NPIs is incompatible with the accumulated data.\u201d \nThe study even looked into the potential of stay-at-home orders\u00a0facilitating spread\u00a0of the virus: \n\u201cThe direction of the effect size in most scenarios point towards an increase in the case growth rate, though these estimates are only distinguishable from zero in Spain (consistent with non-beneficial effect of lockdowns). Only in Iran do the estimates consistently point in the direction of additional reduction in the growth rate, yet those effects are statistically indistinguishable from zero. While it is hard to draw firm conclusions from these estimates, they are consistent with a recent analysis that identified increase transmission and cases in Hunan, China during the period of stay-at-home orders from increased intra-household density and transmission. In other words, it is possible that stay-at-home orders may facilitate transmission if they increase person-to-person contact where transmission is efficient such as closed spaces.\u201d \nIt continues: \u201cWe do not question the role of all public health interventions, or of coordinated communications about the epidemic, but we fail to find an additional benefit of stay-at-home orders and business closures. The data cannot fully exclude the possibility of some benefits. However, even if they exist, these benefits may not match the numerous harms of these aggressive measures. More targeted public health interventions that more effectively reduce transmissions may be important for future epidemic control without the harms of highly restrictive measures.\u201d \nYou can read the full study here.",

                "title": "Why Could Beirut\u2019s Port Disaster Warrant Distress?",
                "text": "The Figurative Foreshadowing of CatastrophePhoto by Darius Bashar on\u00a0UnsplashAny reports of large explosions in the world beaming on TV from multiple news outlets is always attention-grabbing. So when the headlines of the Beirut port explosion on August 5, 2020 scrolled by, then followed up within several hours of incredible footage from residents, I thought\u200a\u2014\u200athe next thing we need after a global pandemic, racial and political protests, economic strife, would be more geopolitical conflict warranting possible military attention and more conflict. So while awaiting the facts to roll in, I can\u2019t deny that my initial fears were that of some attack in Lebanon; Anything more devastating during domestic crises would be global\u00a0crises. But the truth that became reported just seemed even worse; there was mention of governmental and port and customs officials oversight, then unresolved legal complications, a Russian freighter had to leave it, storage in \u2018Warehouse 12\u2019, the goods were unsecured, then massive figures and time\u00a0frames\u2026 I couldn\u2019t help but feel distressed hearing it all given the sheer volume of ammonium nitrate that exploded, reportedly 2,750 metric tons, which would make it 1,375 times bigger than that of the 2 tons used in a previous domestic terrorist attack, as so immediately pointed out by every TV news network which falsely gave me the initial impression that it may have been a terrorist act. Then, it was slowly coming out of the news of the length of time of repeated pleas, warnings, internal requests for responsibility: 6 years. 6 years(!) was the amount of time the entire lot of 2,750 tons of explosive material should have been secured and resolved. 2,750 tons? 6 years of no action? How could this have happened? All in all, it was reportedly clear\u200a\u2014\u200apure and simple: utter and total negligence. Negligence? I sighed\u00a0heavily. I couldn\u2019t believe the news. I mean, I couldn\u2019t believe it but I could believe it because of the current American political and social\u00a0climate. Were Americans worried next how a similar explosion might happen to us on our shores on our ports? I\u2019m sure there were and is addressed by one article from USA Today\u00a0here. But that is a very superficial concern. The enormity of the explosion and aftermath of damage and death cannot be of course understated and is still being assessed. It\u2019s horrible to read that even doctors had to treat colleagues in a damaged hospital while being overwhelmed with victims. This event was so large, by one Australian news outlet, SBS News, titling their article as \u2018Beirut explosion was one of the biggest non-nuclear blasts in human history\u2019 saying per a British engineer it was like 1,000\u20131,500 tons of TNT; the destruction was as far out as a 140-mile radius, at least, and so loud that even Cyprus (125 miles away) heard it; the port \u2014a major port of the Middle East\u200a\u2014\u200arazed. Does this horrendous tragedy for the Lebanese\u200a\u2014\u200aI am told by a friend, Beirut was considered like the Paris of the Middle East, implying it to be for many a treasured jewel of a place\u2014 foretell any other possible catastrophe, even metaphorically, to some other place as deeply valued by many as\u00a0well? Could this be some harbinger and reminder of what would be to come if we are not careful to repeat the mistakes of history and of so many other events that warn us of a similar aftermath, even figuratively, if left to negligence? The COVID-19 pandemic already is highlighting the consequences of our collective unproductive debates over not having affordable national healthcare and our growing income inequality leading to more poverty. I fear this pandemic is going to wipe out too many more marginalized Americans while the politics of all of it continues to rage on. But what of the negligence of federal mandating of masks? What of the negligence of individuals who ignore scientific medical advice and travel against gubernatorial recommendations out of state or let their guards down and attend a large gathering or party? What of the negligence of specific individuals who want to exercise their right of speech or expression by analogously crying out \u2018fire\u2019 in a crowded theater, causing stampeded deaths, just to exercise their rights to speech or expression despite no actual\u00a0fire? The Black Lives Matters Movement of 2020 is highlighting for me long and deeply rooted problems in our society regarding color, discrimination, and opportunity, and the negligence of companies, corporations, and businesses that have long ignored it and only now (out of arguably desperation to follow current trends to stay relevant) are trying to rectify this with internal company policy\u00a0changes. The militarizing of police and the federal overstepping of the use of sending armed \u2018unmarked\u2019 agents to major cities to unconstitutionally detain suspected rioters is highlighting a constitutional crisis which would be a negligence of the general public if we don\u2019t demand upholding and enforcement of the Constitution. (Remember the protests of Catalonia, Spain and Hong\u00a0Kong). The politicizing of the epidemiological pandemic and the death threats being harbored at scientific public servants, as Dr. Fauci, is highlighting rooted problems we have to authority, criticisms, civil debates and in our social and moral principles which is a negligence of collective cultural reprimand if we don\u2019t say anything about any unacceptable behavior that threatens the stability of our society and degrades our\u00a0decency. The Trump administration\u2019s slew of misinformation, scandals, pompous and indifferent attitude towards their jobs, and the general misuse of their appointed positions is highlighting for me the issues we are facing with active blatantly irresponsible and corrupted behavior from the very top. (CNN\u2019s \u2018Fact check: Trump litters briefing with false, unsubstantiated claims on voter fraud, Covid response and Beirut explosion\u2019; Direct violations of the Constitution by: using one\u2019s elected position for personal financial gain and suggesting to use the White House for political events; Criminal activity being investigated from financial dealings between Deutsche Bank and the Trump organization prior to office). The overt negligence of our federal government, hidden by outright denials and smooth speech, have got to have potential unremitting consequences for the rest of us. Just one of so many imminent national issues: What happens when too many of us are forced out of our homes from the expired Federal Moratorium on Evictions? The sad irony is that while Beirut officials tried as they might have to elicit the right responses to have this \u2018800 pound gorilla in the room\u2019 dealt with, in the very end, all it took might have only been apparently some innocent welding work nearby that may have sparked a fire that ignited the entire flammable material that has now destroyed\u200a\u2014\u200ano decimated\u200a\u2014\u200alives, institutional buildings (hospitals), countless businesses, trade (the port), \u2018the jewel\u2019 of a city, governmental reputation, confidence of the people, new dreams and hopes for so many just like you and\u00a0me.

Still mind blowing police were created to police black activity. The police protect and serve whites. The racism is baked in. There is only 12% of the population that is black and 80% of that population in prison or the criminal system. The injustice of this systematic racism is frustrating.

                "title": "D-Day on U.S. Police",
                "text": "Defund, Demilitarize, DismantlePhoto by Yomex Owo on\u00a0UnsplashD-Day 6 June 1944, is historically attributed to the largest seaborne assault ordered by General Dwight D. Eisenhower, appointed the SHAEF commander over all Allied forces of northwest Europe, for invasion of Normandy by Allied forces in WWII. Even though Allied forces suffered bloody losses, dearly on initial landings, and the full invasion inland lasted over 3 months before France returned into Allied hands, the tactical move was considered a major turning point in the eventual defeat of Nazi Germany in the war. The entire operation, Overlord, took enormous planning, even an additional delayed month than initially planned to accumulate enough of a massive assail, weather forecasting, as well as the many staged diversions to thwart the enemy in discovering the actual landing day and location, and this was ultimately the Western front plan set into motion as the Allied repayment of Stalin\u2019s entry into the war and his Red Army holding off the Nazi Germans on the Eastern\u00a0front. The body count and growing list, painted on Chicago Avenue in Minneapolis, of names of the victims of African-American and ethnic minorities whose deaths were wrongful or questionable at the hands of U.S. police is the visual reminder of the amounting evidence against the system that has undeniably run amok with police force mentality, their quality of judgment, as well as their unions that contractually allow special immunity of violating officers from prosecution and allow erasure of official records of any of their misconduct every four years or so (the San Antonio, TX Officer Jackie Neal case of 2013 as just one of many examples). Excessive force based on racial bias and historiography of the establishment of the police during 19th century Black slavery have already been asserted as the fatal flaws institutionalized within the departments and ranks of police, but it appears even race is not the only cause for its abuse as demonstrated in the separate cases of a sick hospital patient and young and old alike in the recent peaceful protests on both East and West\u00a0coasts: Johnny Leija, 34, Madill, Oklahoma, Excessive Force Leading to Death, 24 May\u00a02011;Dounya Zayer, 20, NYC, Head Trauma and Hospitalized, 29, May,\u00a02020;Leslie Fucron, 59, La Mesa, California, Head & Eye Trauma and Hospitalized, 30 May\u00a02020;Martin Gugino, 75, Buffalo, NY, Head Trauma and Hospitalized, 6 June\u00a02020.The police belligerence we\u2019ve witnessed in new videos during recent peaceful protests have been against both White and Black protesters alike (just a few examples): Mask-pulling NYPD office to pepper spray Black peaceful protester, 30 May\u00a02020;Ramming NYPD police vehicles against a crowd of mixed protesters, 31 May\u00a02020;Infamous St John\u2019s Episcopal Church photo-op clearance of mixed crowd of peaceful protesters (even punching an Australian news crew live on air), 1 June\u00a02020;Gang police assault of White cyclist during peaceful protest in Brooklyn, 7 June\u00a02020.And the list of recent viral videos goes on and\u00a0on. In the aftermath of George Floyd\u2019s murder at the hands of some corrupt police and the current realities about policing that have continued to emerge of horrific videos of police assault, their aggressive attitudes and unbecoming cop behavior affect all of us, no matter our\u00a0race. From further online investigations, it has been sadly elucidating how actually common it has always been. The mentally ill (and even those who care for them as in the 47-year-old, Charlie Kinsey, mental therapist who was shot in Miami back in 2016 beside his autistic patient) are the most vulnerable. In an accepted academic study in 2018, the Chicago Policy Review, in early 2019, highlighted those findings in the study which indicated that 50% of all mentally ill victims of police shootings occurred in their own homes; Whites were 10X more likely to be fatally shot by police, and all races were 7X greater if mentally ill (overall, 23% of all killings by police were victims who had exhibited mental illness). The sustained peaceful protests so far have unfortunately neither slowed any questionable police killings of Black unarmed men while the national debate continues on constructively about defunding police: Maurice Gordon, 28, NJ, Shot Dead, 23 May,\u00a02020;David McAtee, 53, Louisville, Kentucky, Shot Dead, 1 June\u00a02020.Beyond the historical racist origins of the establishment of the police, nearly two decades ago, the 9/11 U.S. terrorist attack became an additional justification to increase federal surveillance and militarization of U.S. law enforcement. Under George W. Bush\u2019s administration, police forces were allowed to acquire military equipment (tanks, shields, grenade launchers, and the like) for free and for whatever use they deemed (no federal audits). Under the Obama administration, due to the rolling out of tanks and assault equipment that police used during the Ferguson protests in 2014 over Michael Brown\u2019s wrongful death from police use of force, the military equipment deployed to police forces and its uses now had to be approved by the Federal Government. Currently, in the Trump administration, having repealed many of those measures put in place from the Obama administration including these federal audits of free military equipment given to police, also has been declaring the increase of domestic militarism of our law enforcement, as an ideal continued from the Trump campaign of the \u2018law-and-order candidate\u2019, which would expect to further widen the gap of trust and confidence between the public and\u00a0police. Within the past several years, there have been calls for greater police reforms, warning signs of sweeping powers of the police unions, even advice on alternative avenues to situations and avoiding involvement of police until as the last resort, and also studies that showed decrease of good favor and the disparity between Black and Whites and between Democrats and Republicans over their public views of police performance. Three years ago based on a Pew Center Research survey, Whites (74%) gave a warm rating for police while only 30% of Blacks gave the same; 30% and 38% Blacks gave very cold to cold ratings, respectively; Hispanics gave 55% warm ratings and 17% cold ratings. Across age groups, views of police continue dissimilarly by race: older Whites over 65 (6%) and 27% Blacks over 50 gave cold ratings; 28% Whites younger than 30 and 46% Blacks younger than 30 gave cold ratings. Among the political parties, Republicans 74% and 86% gave very warm and warm ratings, respectively, juxtaposed with Democrats 33% and 57% for those same\u00a0ratings. So have we all just been duped or brainwashed by prior good marketing, political interests, or even Hollywood, of the integrity of our police all this\u00a0time? Perhaps, not widely known before, but now in the wake of the attentive public from George Floyd\u2019s death, it has been highlighted that some Democratic political contributions come from police unions and the GOP\u2019s implicit abetting the flourish (even the bankrolling by taxpayers) of police unions and their pensions. Politicians, Vice President Biden being no exception in a bid to win the presidency, will modify their support for police reforms against their own\u00a0record. In the entertainment world, shows and movies have possibly desensitized many of us from the stark realities of policing. The two network TV shows that come to my mind from my first memorable impressions of them when I first became interested in crime shows, but not as a complete TV show buff, that were fictionally glowing of cops, were CBS\u2019s NCIS: Los Angeles and NBC\u2019s Chicago\u00a0P.D. My first impressions of CBS\u2019s NCIS: Los Angeles (imminently expected to be renewed for the 12th season this year) was its light and bright aura\u200a\u2014\u200ain the characters\u2019 banters and humorous jabs, of course the prim and diverse cast all whose faces were handsome or have good chemistry with each other, their alternative dress and office (completely casual and contradictory to the subject matter of their tasks and when compared to a traditional special police division), and nothing seemed too gory or too serious to stomach in any of the episodes of those I caught. The show was to me like a lightly comedic soap opera or the charming 007 films before the more stark and realistic Daniel Craig ones. In other words, it was fluffy and fun and not taken as anything close to reality\u200a\u2014\u200atotal eye and mind candy. Watching even one episode, I felt anesthetized for real crime prevention during and after its\u00a0hour. The other police show was NBC\u2019s Chicago P.D. (the season 8 finale already aired but already renewed through season 10 awaiting conditions of the virus pandemic to lift to carry-on filming) because it was like the combination of the NCIS: Los Angeles series of good-natured camaraderie, teamwork and a lot more grit, conflict, and grunge in a more realistic portrayal of police work in a tough city. The premise is full of dark corrupt characters with unclean histories while banding altogether in the pursuit of justice even if being bad or breaking some rules were required. This was still unrealistically satisfying since for the most part, despite their questionable tactics, the police department always appeared as the unexpected but true angels for the city and through all their realistic struggles were always successful in putting away the real bad\u00a0guys. So while I certainly need to awaken from my TV stupor, it seems clear to me the people of Minneapolis know what is best for their own city and if their radical ideas work or evolve into something other cities could model or modify with success, then it is well worth entertaining in order to make big\u00a0changes. These times may or may not be different than others in our history, but while 80% of registered voters expressed in a recent NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll of their fears of national chaos, many still understandably fight against defunding the police, but I say we must be more open-minded. Democratic presidential candidate Biden, Senator Sanders, Governor Cuomo, and Senator Majority Leader Mitch McConnell are all against abolishing the police which they have equated to the term \u2018defunding police\u2019. In Minneapolis, where the idea has fomented into a motion which the city council members will vote unopposed, their meaning of \u2018defunding police\u2019 is further clarified by Congresswoman Omar. ABC news Nightline 9 June 2020 interview with Rep(D) Minnesota Ilhan Omar defines \u2018defunding police\u2019: [I paraphrase] The current Minneapolis police budget is 6X more than is spent on affordable housing, 11X more than is spent on health services, 482X more than is spent on crime prevention; therefore, dismantling the police to use the funds more appropriately from the ground up is the community\u2019s desire to \u2018start anew\u2019 \u2014a \u2018reorientation, reimagining public safety\u2019 directly being community-driven [which I read in between the lines, may or may not directly mean having no police in some version of the future that might look totally different than it does\u00a0today]. The prime example of successful dismantling of the police force that has been used in this argument before is that of the Camden, NJ police. Once known as the worst force of the unsafest city in America, the department was dissolved in 2013 and by sharing its services with the county and with gross structural re-training, there has been a 95% drop in excessive force complaints since\u00a02014. But within Minneapolis itself, opposing leaders and voices for disbanding or restructuring police still exist. Ward 5 Jeremiah Ellison and Ward 3 Steve Fletcher agree on defunding the police and drawing focus on mental health and de-escalation police training, and Ellison points out that it\u2019s time to consider that armed police don\u2019t have to answer every type of call. However, Mylan Masson, the retired Director of the Law Enforcement Program at Hennepin, has a much more traditional view and fears shifting of any law enforcement roles and doesn\u2019t see how there couldn\u2019t be the possibility of unchecked crimes with the confusion or unclearly defined roles from defunding of police. Even Mayor Jacob Frey could not give absolute solidarity nor loyalty to the many local protesters on this issue and flat-out opposed them in person during a rally and was subsequently booed out of the demonstration. Since, Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey has desperately tried to clarify his stance (that he is all for massive structural police reforms but not for total abolishment of the force) but even in his own words how there are major cultural difficulties that exist, preventing legal disciplining of law-breaking police officers, and further admits that they\u200a\u2014\u200athe elected officials\u200a\u2014\u200ahave failed the residents for some time, then his reasons are funnily no farther away from dismantling the police force to allow his city to rebuild something else from the ground\u00a0up. Mayor Melvin Carter, son of a police sergeant of St Paul, Minnesota agrees with Vice President Biden\u2019s calls for \u2018community policing\u2019 as he has already experienced through his father, who lived, shopped, and raised his family within the same community that he policed, but the mayor\u2019s words aligning with Vice President Biden\u2019s doesn\u2019t feel ground-breaking enough for the radical changes that the Minneapolis protesters seem to\u00a0desire. Current and past reforms haven\u2019t yet addressed the formidable police unions that resist all types of reforms and staunchly and legally protect their members nor have they drastically improved on the studies found by the advocacy group, Mapping Police Violence, showing \u201c 99% of killings by police from 2013\u20132019 have not resulted in officers being charged with a\u00a0crime.\u201dThe new House Democratic proposed bill, Justice and Policing Act of 2020, even though it does attack the broad legal immunity currently given to police for charges of legal misconduct and calls for demilitarizing law enforcement along with other major reform proposals including a national system to track prior police misconducts, an idea by Senator of NJ Cory Booker, it is yet to be passed through the Republican-led Senate and signed by the opposing president, Trump, and further ratified into\u00a0law. Yet in a recent interview with ABC news, Senator of NJ, Cory Booker, suggested a \u2018different approach\u2019 while not supporting abolishing police which seems contradictory, as the true different approach is the one that the Minneapolis protestors and city council members, Black Lives Matter, and Congresswoman Omar are leading on without waiting for a federal bill that has yet to survive through congressional debates and\u00a0hurdles. Many national politicians and leaders still don\u2019t recognize what General Dwight D. Eisenhower and General Bernard Montgomery, head of the 21st Army Group and responsible for the land forces, had when they reviewed the Normandy landing plans initially. The generals immediately realized that the penetration scale had to be increased substantially, in the pursuit to topple Hitler, which resulted in delaying the D-Day invasion ultimately by another month, but they insisted to get the proportion right. So the obvious question raised is unless we consider such radical ideas as \u2018defunding police\u2019, will anything else be of enough proportion for shifting outcomes from alternatively just incremental adjustments? Thabo Sefolosha, the Swiss NBA Atlanta Hawks player in 2015 was racially targeted by the NYPD, who broke his leg and later lost in court with a lawsuit payout to him of USD4 million, which was mostly donated by Thabo to a local Atlanta charity, Gideon\u2019s Promise, that supports training of defenders. In a TV interview with CNN aired on 9 June 2020, he says it best, saying that we could use the term \u2018reset\u2019 instead of \u2018defund\u2019 police, which would focus us away from the negative connotation that the word \u2018defund\u2019 might bring, when the real ultimate goal is overturning and restarting over the police and criminal justice\u00a0system. \u2018Defunding police\u2019 clearly could look different in different cities. For Minneapolis, the original idea was proposed initially without enough attention after the 2014 Ferguson protests and today would refer to the complete dismantling of their current police force while diverting the funds to severely underfunded social services and rebuild a community-driven public safety apparatus. For other major cities, like Los Angeles and New York City, both mayors have committed to slashing police budgets and redirecting them to social programs for their communities (LA committing USD150 million), though arguably, the economic disaster due to the COVID-19 pandemic is likely the incentive to slash police budgets anyway, but other cities\u2019 residents are catching on as well now, demanding the same (such as San Antonio,\u00a0TX). Reforms were already taken after the shootings of unarmed residents as Black Jamar Clark in November 2015 and White Justine Damond in July 2017 but failed per Minneapolis City Council Member Lisa Bender, and Minneapolis police unions block meaningful reforms, so thus the rationale for Minneapolis to require more radical change like disbanding the\u00a0police. Another Minneapolis City Councilmen, Philippe Cunningham, also clarifies \u2018defunding\u2019: \u2018\u2026police are not the right response for a myriad of issues: mental health crises, domestic violence calls, opioid overdoses...\u2019The continued outrage of police brutality and of racism have remarkably ignited throngs from multiple global cities in at least 22 nations in a display of solidarity from places as far as Rio de Janeiro, Brazil; Porto, Portugal; Madrid, Spain; Paris, France; Brussels and Liege, Belgium; Milan and Rome, Italy; Berlin, Cologne, Frankfurt, and Stuttgart, Germany; Bristol, London, Luton, and Manchester, England; Cardiff, Wales; Sofia, Bulgaria; Dublin, Ireland; Edinburgh, Scotland; Maastricht, Netherlands; Lausanne, Switzerland; Pristina, Kosovo; Tunis, Tunisia; Pretoria, South Africa; Hong Kong; Seoul, South Korea; Tokyo, Japan; Melbourne and Sydney, Australia; and Toronto, Canada; Global leaders from either democratic or authoritarian governments have also notably voiced condolences to Floyd\u2019s family or condemnation of police behavior as well. (Arguably, authoritarian leaders are utilizing the opportunity of commenting on U.S. demonstrations for their own political benefit and image in their own country). While these global protest numbers are not officially known, it draws attention to the historical and much larger domestic protests of the Million Man and Million Woman Marches during the late 1990\u2019s that aimed to unite the African-American communities around their unique economic and social difficulties, and yet we are still here\u00a0today. So is history just going to keep repeating itself and will never\u00a0change? MSNBC\u2019s Ari Melber\u2019s 4 June 2020 analysis at the conclusion of his show was spectacular; instructing us all to \u2018listen\u2019 more receptively to the stories and grievances of activists and emotively reproachful in his concluding words, \u2018\u2026we fail to listen and act at our own\u00a0peril.\u2019I previously also believed stronger police reforms should be a good start. But that is underwhelming and can never get to the root nor completely resolve unsalvageable rot than just to overhaul (just like in some house renovations). Isn\u2019t it time for a D-Day of the U.S. police system and its\u00a0unions? Defund, demilitarize, and dismantle. Reset, restart anew, reorient, reimagine, and\u00a0rebuild. \u2018If We Burn, You Burn With Us!\u2019 \u00a9 2020 The Secret Aspirant. All rights reserved.

                "title": "Navalny: Russia\u2019s charismatic anti-Putin campaigner",
                "text": "MOSCOW: A charismatic anti-corruption campaigner, Alexei Navalny has been Russia\u2019s leading opposition politician for around a decade, determined to challenge Vladimir Putin\u2018s grip on power despite frequent prison stays and harm to his health.  The Yale-educated 44-year-old lawyer \u2014 who has said he will return to Russia from Germany on Sunday after treatment there for a poisoning attack in Siberia \u2014 has been banned from state television and was barred from challenging Putin in the 2018 presidential election.  Despite being frequently jailed and physically attacked, he has vowed to continue in politics after being poisoned with the Novichok nerve agent in August.  In a video announcing his return, Navalny said he was \u201calmost healthy\u201d and can continue recovering at home after a poisoning he insists was carried out by Russia\u2019s domestic security agency, the Federal Security Service (FSB), on Putin\u2019s orders.  Navalny has won a young fan base through viral videos exposing corruption among the elites and has more than two million followers on Twitter.  He has grabbed attention with his uncompromising rhetoric and coined phrases such as the \u201cparty of crooks and thieves\u201d to slam the ruling United Russia party.  In 2011, the anti-corruption blogger led mass protests when tens of thousands took to the streets of Moscow to protest vote-rigging in parliamentary elections.  Two years later the father of two stood for Moscow mayor, coming second against Putin ally Sergei Sobyanin.  In 2017, he accused then-prime minister Dmitry Medvedev of massive corruption in a YouTube documentary. That kick-started a fresh wave of protests across the country that was met with police violence and mass arrests.  The same year he had to travel to Spain for surgery after one of several street attacks left him nearly blind in one eye.  Navalny has faced a series of legal cases, which supporters see as punishment for his activism.  In 2013, he was found guilty in an embezzlement case involving a timber deal and given a five-year suspended sentence that disqualified him from running in elections.  In 2014, he was given another suspended sentence, and his brother Oleg, a co-defendant, was jailed for three-and-a-half years in a decision activists likened to a \u201chostage-taking\u201d.  On Monday, papers were filed with a Moscow court asking for that suspended sentence to be converted into jail time, a move Navalny\u2019s allies say is an attempt to block his return to Russia.  With the Kremlin tightly controlling the media, Navalny remains a fringe figure for many Russians, who are exposed to the official portrayal of him as a Western stooge and convicted criminal.  Putin has refused to pronounce Navalny\u2019s name in public, instead referring to him as \u201cthe person you mentioned\u201d, among other euphemisms, when asked directly about the opposition leader.  While barred from mainstream politics, Navalny has sought to expose the lavish wealth of Russia\u2019s elites, broadcasting the findings of his investigations to millions of Russians on social media and YouTube.  In his latest expose, Navalny last month phoned a man he said was an FSB agent involved with his poisoning, who appeared to admit to the attack during the call.  But despite tapping into discontent among a largely young urban middle class he is far from a unifying opposition figure, and some have criticised his anti-immigrant nationalist stance.  He scored his biggest recent political success in local elections in 2019, when pro-Putin parties suffered major losses because of a \u201cSmart Voting\u201d plan Navalny put forward after his allies were barred from standing in numerous races.  The tactic calls for voters to support the one candidate most likely to defeat the ruling party and saw Kremlin-linked candidates drop seats in the Moscow assembly.  Navalny\u2019s offices have been raided repeatedly since, while his Anti-Corruption Foundation was declared a \u201cforeign agent\u201d and ordered to pay several large fines.",

                "text": "(This post contains a detailed video on the topic.) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOne of the most commonly cited causes for Othello\u2019s fall is his jealousy.\u00a0 \n\n\n\nBut is jealousy really the problem?\u00a0 \n\n\n\nIn my previous post on self-conscious men in Othello and Cymbeline, I argue that there\u2019s more to the Moor\u2019s tragedy than jealousy. Much more. In fact, I\u2019d go so far as to say that jealousy isn\u2019t really the main trigger for our tragic hero\u2019s downward spiral.\u00a0 \n\n\n\nNonetheless, jealousy seeds the deadly foliage which eventually ensnares Othello, so it\u2019s worth deep diving into for the rest of this post.\u00a0 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe concept of \u2018hamartia\u2019: Is jealousy Othello\u2019s hamartia?\u00a0\n\n\n\nLike many terms in classical literary theory, \u2018hamartia\u2019 is a semantic can of worms that continues to defy neat interpretation. Since its inception in Aristotle\u2019s Poetics (written circa 335 BC), \u2018hamartia\u2019 has been defined as a tragic flaw, an error in judgment, or a preordained misstep.\u00a0 \n\n\n\nThe simplest way to understand the term is an innate character trait that one cannot get rid of \u2013 and is doomed to tragic ends because of it. But calling it a \u2018flaw\u2019 is somewhat misleading, because the word \u2018flaw\u2019 connotes moral failing, and the \u2018hamartia\u2019 of tragic heroes isn\u2019t always a bad trait.\u00a0 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor example, most of us would agree that Macbeth\u2019s \u2018hamartia\u2019 is his ambition, but ambition coupled with moderation and wisdom can be a very good thing.\u00a0 \n\n\n\nIn a similar vein, Hamlet\u2019s \u2018hamartia\u2019 is his absolutism, but absolutism in the face of temptations could be the sign of a principled person.\u00a0 \n\n\n\nWith Othello, then, is jealousy really the hamartia that transforms him from a gracious and valiant general to a fallen and matricidal wreck? Or is jealousy merely the symptom of a more troubling character trait, from which Othello cannot escape and must contend with? And is jealousy necessarily a moral flaw, or just a complex emotion? \n\n\n\nThe historical context of Othello: the Barbary Company and the Anglo-Moroccan Alliance\u00a0\n\n\n\nTo understand the intersections between Othello\u2019s jealousy and his overall character, it\u2019s important to look at the broader diplomatic currents in late Elizabethan England. The Anglo-Spanish War from 1585-1604 saw the continual erosion of English and Spanish relations, with Elizabeth I and Philip II of Spain at loggerheads with each other over everything from politics to trade.\u00a0 \n\n\n\nKeen to form alliances as a bulwark against Spanish forces, Liz I reached out to the Moroccan Sultan and established the Barbary Company in 1585, which strengthened Anglo-Moroccan diplomatic and trading ties. During this period, the presence of Moorish emissaries grew at the English court (\u2018Moor\u2019 is a term which originally meant Muslim Arabs, but gradually expanded in scope to include sub-Saharan Africans).\u00a0 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSuch relations continued into the Jacobean era (i.e. James VI and I\u2019s reign), and with Shakespeare being so firmly attuned to the political rhythms of James I\u2019s court, the Bard was likely inspired by these \u2018foreign aliens\u2019, at once close and distant, to construct the protagonist of Othello.  \n\n\n\nLike The Merchant of Venice, Othello is about an ethnic \u2018Other\u2019 who must find his way in a world of white Venetians; and like the \u2018Jewish play\u2019, this \u2018Moorish play\u2019 is also based on an Italian source text \u2013 Cinthio\u2019s Un Capitano Moro (\u2018A Moorish Captain\u2019), in which a Moorish general falls victim to the evil orchestrations of his Venetian ensign. \n\n\n\nIn a way, Othello is one of Shakespeare\u2019s most chameleonic characters: he is both man and beast; protector and intruder; lover and murderer; captain and criminal; and in the words of the Duke \u2013 \u201cmore fair than black\u201d, but both fair and black.\u00a0  \n\n\n\nAnd the speed with which Othello \u2018switches on\u2019 one identity or the other is a barometer of the clarity and control he has over a given situation. It\u2019s perhaps ironic for a military man, but the less Othello acts, the clearer and more in control he is (as evidenced in his refusal to partake in the nighttime brawl at the start of the play); on the other hand, each concrete action he takes pushes him further down the tragic abyss (he dismisses Cassio and opens up room for Iago to plant suspicions about Desdemona and Cassio\u2019s relationship; he strikes Desdemona and regards her tears as signs of deceit; he orders Iago to kill Cassio and the plan is botched; he murders Desdemona and all hell breaks loose).\u00a0 \n\n\n\nThe identity of Othello as an alien, however, is central to our interpretation of how hamartia works in this play, because everything the Moor does and says is tied to his self-perception.  \n\n\n\nAs such, his terrible actions are, to some extent, catalysed by a flawed sense of self (and subsequently, by the jealous sentiments this sense of self breeds).  \n\n\n\nAgain, self-perception is the cause; jealousy is but the symptom. He is not motivated by jealousy, but jealousy eggs him on in his quest for acceptance \u2013 both from himself and from those around him.\u00a0 \n\n\n\nOthello\u2019s obsession, then, is with his place in the world and his reputation in the eyes of others, not really with gaining absolute control over his wife.\u00a0 \n\n\n\nThis is, after all, someone who says \u2013\u00a0 \n\n\n\nI had been happy, if the general camp, Pioneers and all, had tasted her sweet body, So I had nothing known.\u00a0 (3.3)\u00a0 \n\n\n\nWould a truly jealous man be content with \u2018sharing\u2019 his wife as long as he is kept in the dark? Hardly. In fact, bar Desdemona, Emilia and Cassio, Othello is arguably the least jealous of the remaining bunch, with Iago, Roderigo, Brabantio and Bianca all exhibiting rather more \u2018classic\u2019 signs of jealous behaviour. \n\n\n\nIn this post, I propose 3 key ideas of jealousy as presented in Othello, which are as follows:\u00a0 \n\n\n\nJealousy is often symptomatic of deeper insecuritiesJealousy defies logic and reasonJealousy is destructive and self-destructive\u00a0\n\n\n\nThere\u2019ll also be a coda at the end, in which I conclude my thoughts on whether Othello is really a tragedy of jealousy.\u00a0 \n\n\n\n(By the way, have you followed my Instagram page for regular posts on English lit study tips? If not, make sure you click the banner below!)  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKey idea 1: Jealousy is often symptomatic of deeper insecurities\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLet\u2019s begin with Iago, the antagonist of the play.\u00a0 \n\n\n\nMost people think of Othello as a play of marital and sexual envy, but the genesis lies, in fact, in professional jealousy. We know this from the very start of Act 1, when Iago expounds his hatred for the Moor to the gullible but well-endowed Roderigo (who is in love with Desdemona and is jealous of Othello for having won the lady\u2019s affections).\u00a0 \n\n\n\nWhile we soon find out that there are many reasons for Iago\u2019s distaste of Othello, the first one he offers is that the Moor has passed him over for a promotion.\u00a0 \n\n\n\nAccording to the ensign, he was on track to become lieutenant, but the position went to \u201cOne Michael Cassio\u201d instead \u2013\u00a0\u00a0 \n\n\n\nThree great ones of the city, In personal suit to make me his lieutenant, Off-capped to him: and, by the faith of man, I know my price, I am worth no worse a place:\u00a0 (1.1)\u00a0 \n\n\n\nThese are the words of a man with a wounded ego, steeped in disappointment and bitterness. The mercenary diction of \u201cmy price\u201d and \u201cworth\u201d suggests that Iago sees professional relationships as mere commercial exchanges, which foreshadows the unemotional, ruthless approach he\u2019ll go on to execute his plot of poisoning Othello\u2019s mind.  \n\n\n\nThe word \u201cplace\u201d \u2013 meaning \u2018office or rank\u2019 \u2013 reflects Iago\u2019s sense of entitlement, as if there\u2019s a specific position that\u2019s exclusive to him, waiting for him to assume.\u00a0 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis notion of singular exclusivity and thwarted prestige will recur in Iago\u2019s later remarks, particularly when he alludes to the rumour of Othello and his wife Emilia\u2019s affair.  \n\n\n\nNotice, by the way, that he makes this claim of knowing his worth before he relates Cassio\u2019s professional triumph, which tells us that the root of his discontent is this sense that he has been cheated out of what he (believes he) \u2018rightfully\u2019 deserves, more so than in any strong jealousy towards Cassio (indeed, it\u2019s arguable if he actually does envy Cassio, whom he disdains as \u201ca great arithmetician\u201d with no more than \u201cbookish theoric\u201d and \u201cmere prattle, without practice [in] all his soldiership\u201d.) \n\n\n\nYet, we soon realise that Iago isn\u2019t just sore about Othello\u2019s \u2018spurn\u2019; he also suspects that there\u2019s something fishy going on between his captain and his wife, Emilia.\u00a0 \n\n\n\nTowards the end of Act 1, Iago reiterates that \u2013\u00a0 \n\n\n\nI hate the Moor:\u00a0 \n\n\n\nWhy?\u00a0 \n\n\n\nAnd it is thought abroad, that \u2018twixt my sheets He has done my office: (1.3)\u00a0 \n\n\n\n\u201cDone my office\u201d means \u2018taken my position\u2019, but it\u2019s interesting that Shakespeare uses professional diction to describe a domestic identity.  \n\n\n\nPerhaps the implication here is that Iago sees his marriage in similar terms as he does his occupation: both are competitions in which he can\u2019t bear to see himself lose \u2013 especially not to a racial outsider, whom he alludes to as \u201cblack Othello\u201d in 2.3, and doesn\u2019t even regard as human, as he tells Brabantio in 1.1, \u201cyour daughter and the Moor are now making the beast with two backs\u201d.  \n\n\n\nOthello and Iago (Photo credit: Electric Literature)\n\n\n\nThe sheer thought of Emilia having cheated on him with a \u2018black beast\u2019, then, is enough to drive Iago up the wall \u2013 no corroboration is necessary \u2013\u00a0 \n\n\n\nI know not if\u2019t be true; But I, for mere suspicion in that kind, Will do as if for surety.\u00a0 (1.3) \n\n\n\nAt the end of Act 2 Scene 1, Iago reiterates this suspicion in a soliloquy \u2013\u00a0 \n\n\n\nFor that I do suspect the lusty Moor Hath leap\u2019d into my seat; the thought whereof Doth, like a poisonous mineral, gnaw my inwards; And nothing can or shall content my soul Till I am even\u2019d with him, wife for wife, Or failing so, yet that I put the Moor\u00a0 At least into a jealousy so strong\u00a0 That judgment cannot cure.\u00a0 (2.1) \n\n\n\nRecalling such earlier references to one\u2019s position (\u201cplace\u201d, 1.1; \u201coffice\u201d, 1.3), we see the notion of a unique station \u2013 \u201cmy seat\u201d \u2013 in this quote. Professionally, Othello may be ranked higher than Iago, but domestically, Iago must maintain his patriarchal dominance, even if it is wield over just one subject: his wife.\u00a0 \n\n\n\nTo have even this taken away from him is unthinkable, and the last blow that his ego \u2013 \u201cmy inwards\u201d \u2013 will stand for without hostile retaliation. Losing a lieutenancy is bad enough, but to be emasculated is unacceptable. Despite this being no more than a suspicion, Iago evokes in a simile that just \u201cthe thought\u201d of it eats away at him \u201clike a poisonous mineral, gnaw[ing] my inwards\u201d.\u00a0 \n\n\n\nSuch is the fragility of his manhood and ego, which is really what troubles Iago, but instead of confronting his crippling insecurities, he externalises his rage and shame onto the \u2018Other\u2019 \u2013 \u201cthe lusty Moor\u201d. The verb \u201cleaped\u201d in \u201cleaped into my seat\u201d tells us that Iago views Othello as a predatory animal rather than a fellow human being (a more human-appropriate verb would be \u2018assumed\u2019, \u2018taken\u2019 or \u2018usurped\u2019 my seat), and his bubbling plot against the Moor as a savage, bestial undertaking.\u00a0 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIago\u2019s deep-rooted insecurities, however, are secondary to those of the titular character, whose fate is basically a tragedy of insecurities. Othello is painfully aware of his inadequacies, whether it be in manner, society or speech.\u00a0 \n\n\n\nThe first glimpse of this comes in Act 1 Scene 3, when the Moor defends himself against Brabantio\u2019s accusations of \u2018stealing\u2019 Desdemona at the council chamber. Before Othello gets to the main point about him being neither a sorcerer nor a kidnapper, though, he caveats that \u2013\u00a0 \n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Rude am I in my speech, And little bless\u2019d with the soft phrase of peace: For since these arms of mine had seven years\u2019 pith, Till not some nine moons wasted, they have used Their dearest action in the tented field, And little of this great world can I speak, More than pertains to feats of broil and battle, And therefore little shall I grace my cause In speaking for myself.\u00a0 (1.3) \n\n\n\nMuch has been said about the irony in this speech, which is of course the conspicuous lack of \u2018rudeness\u2019 (meaning coarse and vulgar) in Othello\u2019s oration. Not only is the Moor not coarse with his words, he is incredibly eloquent \u2013 almost poetic. His syntax is marked by the use of hyperbaton (the inversion of normal word order), as in \u201cRude am I in my speech\u201d (vs \u201cI am rude in my speech\u201d), \u201cAnd little of this great world can I speak\u201d (vs \u201cI can speak little of this great world\u201d), \u201cAnd therefore little shall I grace my cause/In speaking for myself\u201d (vs \u201cI shall little grace my cause in speaking for myself\u201d).\u00a0 \n\n\n\nThis technique shifts the first-person pronouns of \u201cI\u201d and \u201cmy\u201d to the back of the line, which enables Othello to convey the impression of self-effacing humility. Of course, he then goes on \u2018humble brag\u2019 by relating the rich experiences and stories of his battles and travels, but the point here is that he acutely registers the precarious need to appear hyper-well-mannered to the Venetians.\u00a0 \n\n\n\nThis awareness, however, belies the self-consciousness he feels as a Moorish outsider in a white Venetian society, as if he has to compensate for his \u2018alien\u2019 status by being extra eloquent, extra agreeable, and extra tactful. That\u2019s all good and well at this stage in the play, but Othello\u2019s self-awareness of \u2018not belonging\u2019 reveals for us the wobbly foundations of his confident stature, which will later morph into a much deadlier instinct at the hands of Iago\u2019s monstrous meddling.\u00a0 \n\n\n\nIndeed, as we see in Act 3 Scene 3, when Iago starts \u201cpour[ing] [his] pestilence into [Othello\u2019s] ear\u201d, Othello\u2019s composure starts to crack, and out spills his deepest, most incriminating insecurities. At Iago\u2019s suggestion that Desdemona may be up to no good with Cassio, and that Othello should \u201clook to your wife; observe her well with Cassio\u201d, the Moor immediately doubts himself, and exposes the niggling anxieties within himself that\u2019ll soon cloud his judgment \u2013\u00a0 \n\n\n\nIf I do prove her haggard, Though that her jesses were my dear heartstrings, I\u2019d whistle her off and let her down the wind, To pray at fortune. Haply, for I am black And have not those soft parts of conversation\u00a0 That chamberers have, or for I am declined Into the vale of years, \u2013 yet that\u2019s not much \u2013\u00a0 She\u2019s gone.\u00a0 (3.3) \n\n\n\n\u201cFor I am black\u201d; and she is white. \u201cFor I am declined\u201d and old; but she is young. These contrasts, while previously the mark of a humanistic triumph in \u201cthe celebration of [Othello and Desdemona\u2019s] nuptial\u201d (2.2), are now reframed as shameful comparative points by the self-conscious Moor.  \n\n\n\nThe irony, of course, is that Desdemona fell for him precisely because he is a foreigner (although her love goes beyond a fascination with exoticism), and because he is much older and more mature.\u00a0 \n\n\n\nOthello\u2019s remark that that he is \u201cdeclined/Into the vale of years\u201d also forebodes the \u2018decline\u2019 which characterises his trajectory from this point onwards in the play, and is reinforced by the symbolic image of a dent and a low area of land connoted by the word \u201cvale\u201d.\u00a0 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs Othello becomes more convinced by Desdemona\u2019s \u2018falseness\u2019, he equates the alleged dishonour of \u201cher name\u201d with the black complexion of his face \u2013\u00a0 \n\n\n\nBy the world, I think my wife be honest and think she is not; I think that thou art just and think thou art not.\u00a0 I\u2019ll have some proof. Her name, that was as fresh As Dian\u2019s visage, is now begrimed and black As mine own face. [\u2026]\u00a0 (3.3) \n\n\n\nAs Othello agonises over the tug of paradoxes between thinking his wife is honest and is not; Iago is just and is not, he wavers, but he soon confirms \u2013 all without \u201csome proof\u201d. It\u2019s ironic that he should use past tense in his simile of Desdemona\u2019s \u201cname, that was as fresh/As Dian\u2019s visage\u201d (Dian is an allusion to Diana, the Roman Goddess of the Moon and of chastity), because the audience knows that she remains chaste and pure, despite Othello\u2019s misguided accusations.\u00a0 \n\n\n\nBut he then parallels her \u2018sullied\u2019 name with his \u201cbegrimed and black\u2026 face\u201d; the blackness of his face is a physical, objective truth which does not carry positive or negative connotations in itself, and yet we see that Othello has internalised the stereotypical associations of blackness with evil, which he reaffirms in this false equation of moral fallenness and dark skin.\u00a0 \n\n\n\nKey idea 2: Jealousy defies logic and reason\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to think of Othello (and to an extent, Iago) as the only agents of jealousy in the play, and that\u2019s fair, because their jealousies are the main catalysts of the tragedy. But even a minor character like Brabantio \u2013 Desdemona\u2019s dad and a Venetian senator \u2013 is afflicted with this \u2018disease\u2019 of what Iago terms \u201cthe green-eyed monster\u201d (3.3).\u00a0 \n\n\n\nBrabantio is purely Shakespeare\u2019s invention, as Cinthio\u2019s text does not include this father figure. Interestingly, we see the shadow of Shylock in Brabantio, both being fathers of daughters who have married with men they disapprove of.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut there is a crucial difference between Shylock and Brabantio: while Shylock has always despised Christians (Lorenzo, the man Shylock\u2019s daughter Jessica elopes with, is a Christian), Brabantio was apparently friendly to Othello before he found out about the latter\u2019s marriage to his daughter, as we find out from Othello\u2019s testimony at the council chamber \u2013 with Brabantio in attendance.\u00a0 \n\n\n\nIs it possible, then, for someone to be perfectly cordial to another on professional terms, but to be absolutely repulsed by that same person on matters of familial relations? Many readers have attributed Brabantio\u2019s revulsion towards Othello to pure racism, but there\u2019s more to it than that, which I think includes a good amount of paternal jealousy, a sort of \u2018reverse Electra Complex\u2019, as it were, where a possessive father can\u2019t quite let go of his daughter.\u00a0 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe fact that Brabantio didn\u2019t like Roderigo as a suitor is early evidence of this: \u201cMy daughter is not for thee\u201d (1.1), Brabantio tells Roderigo at the start of the play, and it\u2019s only after he realises that Othello is the \u2018alternative\u2019 that he changes tack and says to Roderigo, \u201cO, would you had had her!\u201d Brabantio\u2019s immediate assumption is that Othello must have stolen his daughter, despite him a) having spent much time with Othello, and b) presumably having a solid understanding of his own child, Desdemona.\u00a0 \n\n\n\nWe know that Brabantio likes Othello as a person when the latter tells the Duke and senators that \u2013\u00a0 \n\n\n\nHer father loved me; oft invited me; Still questioned me the story of my life,\u00a0 From year to year, the battles, sieges, fortunes, That I have passed.\u00a0 I ran it through, even from my boyish days, To the very moment he bade me tell it; [\u2026] (1.3) \n\n\n\nNotice the active verbs Othello uses in relation to Brabantio \u2013 \u201cloved me\u201d, \u201cinvited me\u201d, \u201cquestioned me\u201d, \u201cbade me\u201d: the emphasis is that Brabantio was, in a way, the \u2018courter\u2019 in their relationship, who took the proactive initiative of inviting Othello over to his house and asking about his exotic life stories.  \n\n\n\nContrary to Brabantio\u2019s accusation of Othello being the unwelcome intruder, then, we see the opposite is the case, and that if anything, Brabantio is largely responsible for Othello and Desdemona\u2019s marriage, having facilitated the proximity between the Moor and his daughter.  \n\n\n\nYet Brabantio, while himself charmed by the Moor\u2019s speech, somehow cannot fathom that his daughter would be equally attracted to the man, and insists that she must have been \u2018charmed\u2019 by sorcery instead.\u00a0 \n\n\n\nUpon seeing the Moor after he finds out about the marriage, Brabantio draws his sword and barks \u2013\u00a0 \n\n\n\nO thou foul thief, where hast thou stow\u2019d my daughter? Damn\u2019d as thou art, thou hast enchanted her;\u00a0 For I\u2019ll refer me to all things of sense, If she in chains of magic were not bound, Whether a maid so tender, fair and happy, So opposite to marriage that she shunned The wealthy curled darlings of our nation,\u00a0 Would ever have, to incur a general mock, Run from her guardage to the sooty bosom Of such a thing as thou, to fear, not to delight.\u00a0 That thou hast practised on her with foul charms, Abused her delicate youth with drugs or minerals That weaken motion: I\u2019ll have\u2019t disputed on; \u2018Tis probable and palpable to thinking.\u00a0 (1.2) \n\n\n\nBesides showing his fury, Brabantio betrays the logical gaps in his thought at this moment. First, just because \u201cshe shunned/The wealthy curled darlings of our nation\u201d (a reference to rich white Venetian suitors) doesn\u2019t mean that she is \u201coppose[d] to marriage\u201d. This is a non sequitur, and Brabantio attempts to bridge the illogicality in his claim by pointing to Othello\u2019s supposed \u201cfoul charms\u2026 drugs or minerals\u201d as the cause.\u00a0 \n\n\n\nIt\u2019s hard to believe that the father, in calmer circumstances, would believe his daughter to be so deprived of independent thinking, especially when we\u2019ll very soon witness in the next scene (1.3) Desdemona\u2019s clarity of mind and soundness in judgment.\u00a0 \n\n\n\nIt is surely ironic, then, that Brabantio should conclude his rant with a pseudo-appeal to thought: \u201cI\u2019ll have\u2019t disputed on; \u2018Tis probable and palpable to thinking\u201d, since this speech exposes the fundamental lack in reason of Brabantio\u2019s accusation towards the Moor.\u00a0 \n\n\n\nBeing the consummate schemer that he is, Iago understands the reason-shaped hole that resides in jealousy, and he manipulates this to extreme ends for his evil self-interest. Having asked his wife Emilia to steal Desdemona\u2019s handkerchief \u2013 a gift from Othello, Iago tells us that he\u2019ll plant this incriminating prop in Cassio\u2019s house, and devise a situation wherein Othello will see Cassio holding onto the handkerchief, therefore jumping to the conclusion that Desdemona must have given it to her secret lover.\u00a0 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIago is confident that this plan will work, because he knows that \u2013\u00a0 \n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Trifles light as air Are to the jealous confirmations strong As proofs of holy writ:\u00a0 (3.3) \n\n\n\nThe clash between the juxtaposition of \u201clight\u201d and \u201cstrong\u201d is couched within the simile of \u201ctrifles light as air\u201d to \u201cstrong as proofs of holy writ\u201d, but to compare two things that are so dissimilar exposes the very illogicality of the comparison. To the jealous, then, even the most trivial things would seem to carry the weight of scriptural words, which is why jealousy so often drives people to make erroneous links between the fake and the real, the flimsy and the legitimate.\u00a0 \n\n\n\nIn a less sinister iteration of this idea, Emilia offers practical wisdom on the baseless nature of jealousy, and the futility of getting the jealous-minded to see any reason at all. Responding to Desdemona\u2019s bewilderment over the cause of Othello\u2019s rage, Emilia says \u2013\u00a0 \n\n\n\nEMILIA:\u00a0 Pray heaven it be state-matters, as you think, And no conception nor no jealous toy Concerning you. DESDEMONA: Alas the day! I never gave him cause.\u00a0 EMILIA: But jealous souls will not be answered so; They are not ever jealous for the cause, But jealous for they are jealous: \u2018tis a monster Begot upon itself, born on itself.\u00a0 (3.4) \n\n\n\nEmilia\u2019s metaphor of jealousy as \u201ca monster\u201d echoes her husband\u2019s earlier reference to \u201cthat green-eyed monster\u201d. Her most striking line, though, is \u201cBut jealous for they are jealous\u201d, the tautology of which shows that there need not be any premise for the breeding of jealous thoughts or emotions.\u00a0 \n\n\n\nThe epistrophe in the line \u201cbegot upon itself, born on itself\u201d reinforces the vicious circularity of jealousy: It is like a pernicious weed that grows without end, and the more it grows the more it harms its host (which also reminds us of Iago\u2019s characterisation of \u201cthe green-eyed monster/which doth mock the meat it feeds on\u201d, 3.3).\u00a0 \n\n\n\nThe self-echoing homophones of \u201csouls\u201d and \u201cso\u201d in \u201cjealous souls will not be answered so\u201d also suggests a sense of stasis, and in turn, the impossibility of progress in rational dialogue with someone like Othello. This bodes ill for Desdemona, because all she has left to defend herself is her speech.\u00a0 \n\n\n\nIn a tragic, ironic twist, while it was her skillful and subtle way with words that first gave Othello the courage to pursue her (which we know from Othello\u2019s testimony in 1.3, when he recalls that \u201cshe thank\u2019d/And bade me, if I had a friend that loved her,/I should but teach him how to tell my story,/And that would woo her.\u201d), she is now unable to leverage that same tool to talk sense back into her husband.\u00a0 \n\n\n\nKey idea 3: Jealousy can be destructive\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy now, we see that jealousy \u2013 while not always the primary cause of events \u2013 is the gravitational source of all destruction in the play. Consider the summary below:\u00a0 \n\n\n\nOthello is jealous of Cassio \u2192 kills Desdemona \u2192 he dies from suicideBrabantio is jealous of Othello \u2192 he dies from grief (allegedly)Roderigo is jealous of Othello \u2192 he dies from Iago\u2019s murderIago is jealous of Cassio and Othello \u2192 kills Emilia \u2192 he is punished by Cassio\u00a0Bianca is jealous of Cassio\u2019s supposed \u201cnewer friend\u201d \u2192 she is not taken seriously by Cassio\n\n\n\nBut:\u00a0 \n\n\n\nCassio isn\u2019t jealous of anyone \u2192 he gets to live and rule over Cyprus\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(This only takes into account main characters, so we\u2019re not considering ancillary characters like the Duke of Venice, Lodovico, Gratiano etc.)\u00a0 \n\n\n\nFor all the men (bar Cassio), jealousy is the engine that sets in motion the subsequent destructive (and self-destructive) events. Had Roderigo not been jealous of the Moor\u2019s successful courtship of Desdemona, he wouldn\u2019t have become a pawn for Iago\u2019s poisonous plot:\u00a0 \n\n\n\nRODERIGO I am changed: I\u2019ll go sell all my land.\u00a0 IAGO Thus do I ever make my fool my purse:\u00a0 For I mine own gained knowledge should profane, If I would time expend with such a snipe\u00a0 But for my sport and profit.\u00a0 (1.3) \n\n\n\nHad Iago not been jealous of Cassio\u2019s promotion and Othello\u2019s superiority, perhaps he wouldn\u2019t have had as strong a motivation to wreak havoc. This is reflected in his numerous references to \u2018hating\u2019 Othello, including \u2013\u00a0 \n\n\n\nI do hate him as I do hell-pains (1.1)\u00a0 \n\n\n\nWhen he reiterates to Roderigo in Act 1 Scene 3 \u2013\u00a0 \n\n\n\nThou art sure of me: go, make money \u2013 I have told Thee often, and I re-tell thee again and again, I Hate the Moor: my cause is hearted; thine hath no Less reason.\u00a0 (1.3) \n\n\n\nAnd once again, when Iago concludes the same scene \u2013\u00a0 \n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I hate the Moor:\u00a0 And it is thought abroad, that twixt my sheets He has done my office:\u00a0 (1.3) \n\n\n\nHad Othello not been jealous of Cassio\u2019s relative youth and charm, he wouldn\u2019t have fallen for Iago\u2019s prevarications. For all the cordiality and \u2018love\u2019 he once held for his lieutenant Cassio, there\u2019s an undergird of rivalry in their relationship, which is revealed when Othello hides behind the curtains and observes Iago and Cassio\u2019s \u2018handkerchief\u2019 exchange. Upon seeing Cassio\u2019s laughter (over Iago\u2019s suggestion that he should marry Bianca, but Othello being out of earshot, doesn\u2019t hear this), the Moor murmurs \u2013\u00a0 \n\n\n\nDo you triumph, Roman? Do you triumph? (4.1)\u00a0 \n\n\n\nThe word \u201ctriumph\u201d shows that the Moor sees Cassio in competitive terms, and despite his clear professional superiority to Cassio, the idea that his lieutenant should trump him in the domestic and sexual sphere proves a much greater blow to his masculinity.\u00a0 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinally, had Brabantio not been jealous of Othello\u2019s supposed \u2018thievery\u2019 of his daughter, he wouldn\u2019t have died so soon. As Gratiano reports in the final scene \u2013\u00a0 \n\n\n\nPoor Desdemona! I am glad thy father\u2019s dead: Thy match was mortal to him, and pure grief Shore his old thread in twain: (5.2) \n\n\n\nEven for someone like Bianca, who doesn\u2019t meet the fatal end of the other female characters in the play, her jealousy doesn\u2019t win her any respect. We know this because her suspicions of Cassio having another lover \u2013 \u201ca newer friend\u201d, \u201ca hobby-horse\u201d \u2013 are made the butt of Cassio\u2019s jokes, which we see when Iago \u2018questions\u2019 Cassio in the staged handkerchief moment in Act 4 Scene 1 about marrying Bianca, whereby the lieutenant dismisses the notion that he would ever marry a whore \u2013\u00a0 \n\n\n\nIAGO She gives it out that you shall marry her: Do you intend it? CASSIO Ha, ha, ha! [\u2026] I marry her! What? A customer? Prithee, bear some Charity to my wit: do not think it so unwholesome.\u00a0 Ha, ha, ha!\u00a0 (4.1) \n\n\n\nWhile Desdemona and Emilia are not themselves victims of jealousy, they fall victim to the victims of jealousy. Desdemona is eventually killed by a rage-filled, jealousy-blinded husband; and Emilia is stabbed by her evil, Machiavellian husband.\u00a0 \n\n\n\nUnable to counter the force of their husbands\u2019 moral and emotional influence, the two female characters are thus portrayed to be the scapegoats of a patriarchal social structure, in which good sense and rational judgment are subsumed under the overcast of violent male egos.\u00a0 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCoda: Is Othello really a tragedy of jealousy?\u00a0\n\n\n\nTo end a rather long (but hopefully comprehensive!) blog post, I\u2019d like to look at Othello\u2019s final speech in Act 5 Scene 2, right before he kills himself after realising his wrongful murder of Desdemona \u2013\u00a0 \n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I pray you, in your letters, When you shall these unlucky deeds relate, Speak of me as I am; nothing extenuate, Nor set down aught in malice: then must you speak Of one that loved not wisely but too well; Of one not easily jealous, but being wrought Perplex\u2019d in the extreme; of one whose hand, Like the base Indian, threw a pearl away Richer than all his tribe; of one whose subdued eyes, Albeit unused to the melting mood, Drop tears as fast as the Arabian trees Their medicinal gum. [\u2026]\u00a0 (5.2) \n\n\n\nIs it possible, that after so much ado with \u201cthe green-eyed monster\u201d, for Othello to actually say that he is \u201cone not easily jealous\u201d, and to make a serious point about not wanting to be remembered as a jealous man? What could Shakespeare be suggesting about the root \u2018cause\u2019 of this tragedy, then?\u00a0 \n\n\n\nThere are those who have commented on the blame-shifting nature of this poignant monologue, but there is perhaps a more reasonable interpretation.\u00a0 \n\n\n\nInstead of focusing on the Moor\u2019s remark that he was \u201cwrought/Preplex\u2019d in the extreme\u201d by evil forces, we would benefit from directing our attention to his phrase \u201csubdued eyes\u201d. It isn\u2019t so much the feelings of jealousy that had led Othello astray, but rather, the psychological and cognitive impacts of jealousy. He is \u2018overwhelmed\u2019 (the meaning of \u2018subdued\u2019 here) by the confusion of the signal and the noise of jealous agents around him, and as such, was compelled to fall back on native instincts and to dispense with clear judgment.\u00a0 \n\n\n\nOthello and Desdemona (Photo credit: The Conversation)\n\n\n\nUltimately, Othello\u2019s tragedy is in being a foreigner forced to assimilate in foreign land. He is given the challenge of venturing beyond his realm of expertise \u2013 military service \u2013 and into that of social, marital and sexual relations, which he fails to master for lack of Venetian sensibilities.\u00a0 \n\n\n\nStill, this failure is what has enabled him to live out the maximum extent of his emotions \u2013 to \u201clove\u2026 too well\u201d. Having done this, then, there\u2019s probably not much left in mortal life for him to stick around, and so, instead of regarding his suicide as the natural destination of a tragic fate, we could choose to see it as a redeeming liberation from a tragic world, which in turn makes the Moor\u2019s death a bit less, well, tragic.\u00a0 \n\n\n\nFor a detailed analysis on other Shakespearean plays, check out my posts below:\u00a0\n\n\n\nWhat does\u00a0Romeo & Juliet\u00a0show us about love?\u00a0Why is\u00a0Hamlet\u00a0such a fascinating character?What does\u00a0King Lear\u00a0show us about blindness?Ambition in\u00a0Macbeth: 4 key ideas\u00a0Justice in The Merchant of Venice: 3 key ideas",

Hans-Olaf Henkel, who had backed Mr Merz for the top job, accused Mrs Merkel\u2019s supporters of engineering his defeat \u2013 while warning the German Chancellor she could not afford to ignore him, but should instead offer him the powerful position of Minister of the Economy. \n\n\nMr Laschet, Prime Minister of Germany\u2019s North Rhine-Westphalia region, is regarded as the Merkel continuity candidate. \nHe defeated Mr Merz, who was pushed out of his role as CDU parliamentary leader by Mrs Merkel in 2002, prompting a rift which persists to this day, by 521 votes to 466 in the second round of voting among 1,001 delegates to a specially convened online congress to decide the issue. \nNevertheless Mr Henkel, who stepped down from the European Parliament in 2019, believes the 65-year-old successful businessman, who has not been a member of the Bundestag since 2009, remains a crucial figure who must not be sidelined. \n\n\nHe told\u00a0Express.co.uk\u00a0yesterday: \u201cMerz was clearly blocked by Merkel\u2019s following. \n\u201cStill in November, Merz had a huge lead in the polls and among the party delegates. \n\u201cThat\u2019s why Merkel\u2019s troops used all sorts of tricks and excuses to delay the vote.\u201d \nREAD MORE:\u00a0EU on the brink \u2013 Victory of \u2018mini-Merkel\u2019 may push more countries out \n\n\nBy pushing back the scheduled vote, Mrs Merkel had been able to boost Mr Laschet\u2019s chances while hampering those of Mr Merz, Mr Henkel explained. \nHe added: \u201cMerkel\u2019s closest advisor Helge Braun, Germany\u2019s Minister of Special Affairs, came out publicly to endorse Laschet, and a number of Prime Ministers close to Merkel, too. \n\u201cSince Laschet had a public office he used this to constantly present himself in the media.\u201d \n\n\nMr Henkel suggested Mr Merz how had two options. \nHe explained: \u201cEither he waits for an attractive ministerial post in the next Government for instance as Minister of the economy or he steps aside completely. \n\u201cI am in favour of the first because as a result of Corona, Trump and Brexit Germany is losing its economic position quickly. \n\u201cMerz would be the only leading CDU person with business experience.\u201d \n\n\nMr Henkel was elected as an MEP for Alternative for Germany (AfD) in 2014, before quitting the party the following year after the election of the right-wing Frauke Petry as leader, concerned by its consequent dramatic shift to the right. \nHe warned: \u201cNext to Merkel, the AfD is the real winner of Laschet\u2019s victory. \n\u201cOnly the liberal-conservative Merz would have been able to check this right wing party. \n\u201cI am sure they will open a few bottles of champagne tonight.\u201d \n\n\nSpeaking after the announcement of the result, Mr Merz himself echoed the words of Mr Henkel, saying: \u201cI offered the new party chairman to join the current federal government and take over the Federal Ministry of Economics.\u201d \nMr Merz claimed he had been offered the role by Mr Laschet \u2013 but Mrs Merkel\u2019s office responded a statement saying:\u201dThe Chancellor is not planning any government reshuffle.\u201d \nPeter Altmaier currently occupies the role \u2013 and Marco Wanderwitz, State Secretary in the Federal Ministry of Economics and the Federal Government\u2019s Eastern Commissioner, tweeted: \u201c@peteraltmaier\u00a0does a great job as Federal Minister of Economics. No need for applicants.\u201d \n(Additional reporting by Monika Pallenberg)",

                "text": "The election of the Biden-Harris ticket will, we are told, hasten the death of the internal combustion engine in the United States. Once the sale of new gasoline engine vehicles is banned, the only question remaining is how long before driving them is also outlawed? Well, incoming Vice President Kamala Harris promised that, \u201cBy my plan, by 2045 we will have basically zero emission vehicles only.100 percent by 2045.\u201d President-elect Biden has promised in his two trillion dollar \u201cclimate change\u201d plan [a major downsize from Bernie Sanders\u2019 $16 trillion Green New Deal] \u201crigorous new fuel economy standards aimed at ensuring 100 percent of new sales for light- and medium-duty vehicles will be zero emission vehicles (ZEVs).\u201d Harris has called for this ban to begin by 2035, perhaps even sooner, if the momentum for change continues.  To jumpstart the transformation of the 99.5 percent of the U.S. vehicle fleet that are not ZEVs, Biden ally Sen. Chuck Schumer plans to introduce legislation authorizing $$454 billion \u201ccash for clunkers\u201d incentives or rebates to people to enable them to replace gasoline-powered vehicles with all-electric vehicles (EVs). The plan also includes building half a million new EV battery charging stations, along with replacing the entire U.S. government vehicle fleet with EVs. Not since Henry Ford introduced the assembly line for his Model T in 1913 has America faced such a transition in transportation. But the Big Switch to an all-EV fleet will bring massive changes to American society. It will create new winners and new losers, make owning any vehicle a near impossibility for the transient and poor, and shift the balance of world power away from its long-term dependence on \u201cthe free flow of oil at market prices.\u201d The Big Switch has been in the works for years. As early as 2017, many countries had already announced dates for internal combustion engine (ICE) bans. Norway clarified that its 2025 date was just a \u201csuggestion,\u201d but Germany, France, and the United Kingdom had set \u201cfirm\u201d dates of 2040 while the Netherlands had pushed the funeral to 2030. Austria, Denmark, Ireland, Japan, Portugal, South Korea, and Spain had also set dates, as had India \u2013 and several American states. Major automakers, too, have pledged to end ICE vehicle production soon, even though polls in 2017 showing that only 30 percent of millennials (and much lower percentages of older drivers) were willing to invest in an electric vehicle. This despite claims by economist Tilak Doshi (among others) that after 50,000 miles on the road, the typical EV has been responsible for 76 percent as much carbon dioxide emissions as a gasoline-powered vehicle. As renowned economist Bjorn Lomborg had explained in 2013, EV batteries are the product of emission-intensive mining operations (which in some cases involve children laboring in very dirty air) and the electricity for recharging these batteries involves additional CO2 emissions. So the term \u201czero emission vehicles\u201d is really a misnomer, as the emissions are just transferred from the wealthy West to developing nations or rural America. The Big Switch also signals major declines in jobs in the oil and gas industry, declining revenues for convenience stores that profit from gasoline sales, and significant manufacturing cost increases for petrochemicals, automobile and truck tires, roof shingles, plastics, and a host of other consumer products that rely on oil refineries for raw materials. Many also state that the electric vehicle mandates will ultimately harm the auto repair and auto insurance industries. The EV has maybe 20 moving parts, compared with 2,000 for ICE vehicles, but these parts tend to be more expensive and in the short run at least less readily available. This suggests that EVs needing repairs will sit longer at the garage (at the garage\u2019s expense). Any delays in parts availability thus add to the holistic cost of vehicle maintenance. But will insurers cover these added costs? The Big Switch will also mandate major shifts in tax policy for local and state governments and the federal government, all of which rely heavily on gasoline taxes to cover the costs of highway maintenance. The 18.4 cents per gallon federal excise tax funds the Highway Trust Fund that pays for infrastructure and transportation costs (with a separate small tax covering remediation of leaking underground storage tanks).  As gasoline sales continue to decline, will Washington find a way to replace this lost revenue? [Given that we are also entering the era of the driverless vehicle, one wonders how these computer-driven behemoths will handle massive potholes?] Highways maintained by state and local gasoline taxes are already threatened from declining revenues, thanks to higher mileage vehicles (including EVs and hybrids), and the 2020 pandemic that cut highway driving by 64 percent in April 2020 (and significantly ever since). Some states have already begun adding or increasing registration fees for electric vehicles. Alabama\u2019s fee is $200 for EVs and $100 for plug-in hybrids, a quarter of which will fund EV charging stations, while California began imposing a $100 annual fee last July. But that\u2019s not all. People today can purchase an older gasoline-powered vehicle that will pass inspection for well under $2,000. Batteries for these vehicles cost under $200, and many of the older vehicles are capable of being repaired by amateur mechanics. But replacing an EV battery can cost from $1,000 up to $6,000, making even used electric vehicles unaffordable for tens of millions of Americans in a nation half of whose vehicles are over 10 years old. The Biden-Harris promises may be tough to fully deliver. As recently as 2017, industry experts projected that EVs can only achieve 25 percent of worldwide vehicles by 2050. The Biden-Harris plan also includes a total phaseout of fossil fuels for producing electricity coupled with the significant increase in electricity needed to keep EVs moving. Even if the new visionaries accept nuclear energy as a \u201crenewable\u201d (or at least zero emissions) fuel, bringing sufficient new nuclear power plants online to impact overall energy needs will take decades. But then again, when did Moscow or Beijing ever meet all objectives of their Five-Year Plans?

                "text": "Are European data centres ready for the climate targets of the EU Green Deal, to strengthen climate and environmental protection through digitalisation? A new study with best practices in the field of energy-efficient data centres formulates technological development potentials as well as policy recommendations.\n \n\nDigitalisation needs powerful digital infrastructures in the form of data centres, edge computing, and cloud services. The ecosystem of digital infrastructures requires energy for the transmission, storage and processing of data. European data centres form the backbone of digitalisation and are already among the most energy-efficient in the world. Nevertheless, further efficiency potentials can be exploited in the future, making even greater energy savings possible. Data centres are not in themselves CO2\u00a0producers \u2014 however, they depend on the energy mix available in the respective countries. In Germany in particular, an accelerated energy transition, which further optimises the energy mix available, can help to reduce CO2\u00a0emissions even more rapidly.\n \n\nThese are the central findings of the new study\u00a0\"Data Centres in Europe \u2014 Opportunities for Sustainable Digitalisation \u2014 Part II\"\u00a0published by the Alliance for the Strengthening of Digital Infrastructures in Germany, founded under the umbrella of eco \u2014 Association of the Internet Industry, and jointly developed with the Borderstep Institute, with the support of the Vodafone Institute.\n \n\nThe study also shows that a move away from autonomous and locally-operated IT infrastructure to efficient cloud use can save up to 20 percent of the energy previously required, significantly reduce a company's CO2\u00a0emissions. This is possible because of the optimised server utilisation of cloud providers and the resultant higher energy efficiency. The United States Data Center Energy Usage Report estimates that hyperscale cloud data centres require up to 80% less energy for infrastructure such as cooling and power supply than traditional data centres.\n \n\n\"We now have it in our hands to contribute to a climate-neutral Europe as set out in the EU Green Deal, with the help of powerful and efficient digital infrastructures,\" says Dr. B\u00e9la Waldhauser, spokesperson of the Alliance for the Strengthening of Digital Infrastructures in Germany.\n \n\nFigure 1: Fields of Technology for Which Government Action is Considered Necessary\n \n\nIf politics now invests in research and funding for energy-efficient digital infrastructures, this, in turn, will have a positive effect on many other areas, such as resource-saving industrial and work processes or emission-reducing urban and transport planning. A prerequisite for this is the creation of a functioning digital ecosystem consisting of efficient data centres, broadband networks that have been rolled out to provide coverage across the board, a rapidly increasing number of 5G networks, and all of this utilising software that has been programmed to be highly energy-efficient.\n \nBest practices: Future potential demonstrated in Germany, Portugal, Spain and Sweden\n\nThe study uses various best practice examples to show which locations are already saving large amounts of energy today using the innovative technologies and applications available on the market. These include data centres in Portugal, Spain, Sweden and Germany.\n \n\nThe greatest potential for increased energy efficiency in the area of data centres is offered above all by technologies in the field of data centre cooling and ventilation, especially with regard to waste heat recovery. The German data centre\u00a0Eurotheum, for example, uses a water-based direct cooling system to use around 70 percent of its own waste heat to heat local offices and conference rooms as well as hotels and restaurants.\n \n\nFigure 2: Delphi Survey \u2013 Assessment of the Potential for Reducing Greenhouse Gases in the Technology Fields\n \n\nThe Amazon Web Services (AWS) data centre in Seville, Spain, is considered a best practice example in the promotion and usage of renewable energy. Due to its high levels of solar irradiation, Spain is ideally suited for Photovoltaics (PV). AWS concluded a long-term electricity supply contract in Seville for a photovoltaic (PV) system with a capacity of 149 megawatts. AWS has set itself the goal of becoming climate-neutral by 2040 and of transitioning its energy supply to 80% renewable energy by 2024.\n \n\nIn addition, in 2015, Vodafone launched a multi-year program to optimise the energy efficiency of existing data centres and telecommunication sites in several EU Countries. In the best practice example from Portugal presented in the study, the power usage effectiveness (PUE) was reduced from 1.57 to the current 1.36, an excellent result given the relatively high outside air temperatures in Portugal and the structural condition of these buildings compared to modern, newly-built data centres. At the same time, the data traffic has significantly increased \u2014 by around 40% per year. From July 2021, electricity for all European sites will be supplied using renewable energy.\n \n\nInger Paus, Managing Director of the\u00a0Vodafone Institute: \"The study clearly shows that digital infrastructures such as energy-efficient data centres are a key element in the green transformation of our economy. If we want to achieve sustainable digitalisation in Europe, we must now invest sufficiently both in research into innovative technological approaches and in the promotion and development of energy-efficient digital infrastructures. Only in this way can we achieve the EU goal of reducing CO2\u00a0emissions from data centres by 100 percent by 2030.\"\n \nCO2\u00a0emissions of European data centres have been declining for 5 years despite increasing processing power\n\nThe use cases also illustrate that a large processing capacity and a high CO2\u00a0savings potential are not mutually exclusive, but are two sides of the same coin. Dr. B\u00e9la Waldhauser: \"Politicians are currently often critical of digital technologies and services in terms of their energy balance and climate impact. But this is a fallacy: Digitalisation not only keeps our economic and social life going but is also part of the solution to the climate crisis.\" This is why politics, business and science should now also work closely together to transfer these findings even more strongly to the European data centre industry.\n \n\nThe industry is already on the right track: While the demand for computing power has increased tenfold over the past 10 years as a result of the ongoing digitalisation of the economy and society, the energy consumption per gigabit of data centres is now 12 times lower than in 2010. Since 2015, CO2\u00a0emissions from European data centres throughout Europe have been falling, despite a massive increase in processing power. This trend is set to continue in the future.*\n \nAccelerated energy transition can also massively reduce CO2\u00a0savings in Germany\n\nAt the same time, the alliance of important representatives of the data centre industry sees a significant need for improvement, especially for Germany, in order to implement the goals of the EU Green Deal.\n \n\n\"Of course, the best and most ambitious climate targets are useless unless they are realistic,\" Waldhauser continues. \"Our industry fully supports the EU climate goals, but in order to fully implement the climate-neutral operation, the necessary basic conditions must be created as a first step. In addition to a sustainable ecosystem of digital infrastructures, we need a Digital Single Market that enables locations in Europe to meet the respective requirements on an equal footing and also under comparable conditions and needs. In concrete terms, an industrial electricity price for digital infrastructure providers is certainly the right goal for such a level playing field, and it will allow Europe to remain competitive in the face of international competition.\"\n \n\nDownload the Part I of the study:\n \nData Centres in Europe \u2014 Opportunities for Sustainable Digitalisation\n \n\nDownload the Part II of the study:\n \nData Centres in Europe \u2014 Opportunities for Sustainable Digitalisation\n \n\n\n* Despite a 24% increase in the energy consumption of European data centres (2015-2020), greenhouse gas emissions were reduced by 8% over the same period (cf. Borderstep 2020).\n\n Follow CircleID on Twitter More under: Cloud Computing, Data Center",
