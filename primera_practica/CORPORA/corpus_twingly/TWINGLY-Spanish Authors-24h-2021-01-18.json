Mr Navalny, 44, spent several weeks in a medically induced coma in Germany after collapsing during a flight from Tomsk, a city in Siberia, to Moscow in August.

At the time\u00a0President Putin denied all responsibility and no doubt will continue to\u00a0doing so even though there is a clear pattern of Russia's\u00a0culpability on the world stage:The murder of\u00a0Alexander Litvinenko with\u00a0radioactive Polonium in 2006Team Russia's systematic cheating in the Sochi Winter Olympics 2014Large-scale, organised Russian interference in America's presidential election in 2016The\u00a0attempted assassination of a former Russian spy, Sergei Skripal, and his daughter Yulia on UK soil in 2018 with a\u00a0military\u00a0grade nerve agent\u00a0No wonder Russia is widely regarded as a\u00a0rogue state these days,\u00a0even if Donald Trump and Jeremy Corbyn are both badly out of\u00a0step with public opinion.  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-44235402  MH17 missile owned by Russian brigade, investigators say  Media caption - Investigators said they had evidence of the route taken by a Russian missile convoy  The missile that downed a Malaysia Airlines flight over eastern Ukraine in 2014 belonged to a Russian brigade, international investigators say.  For the first time, the Dutch-led team said the missile had come from a unit based in western Russia.  All 298 people on board the Boeing 777 died when it broke apart in mid-air flying from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur.  It was hit by a missile fired from rebel-held territory in Ukraine. Russia says none of its weapons was used.  But on Thursday Wilbert Paulissen, a Dutch official from the Joint Investigation Team (JIT), told reporters: \"All the vehicles in a convoy carrying the missile were part of the Russian armed forces.\"  He restated the JIT's conclusion that the plane had been destroyed by a Russian-made Buk missile, adding that it had been supplied by the country's 53rd anti-aircraft brigade in Kursk.  At a news conference in the Dutch city of Utrecht, the investigators also showed social media pictures which they said traced the route the missile convoy had taken to reach eastern Ukraine.  What happened to MH17?  The incident occurred at the height of the conflict between government troops and pro-Russian separatists.  The plane left Amsterdam's Schiphol Airport on 17 July 2014 and was due to arrive at Kuala Lumpur in Malaysia on the following day.  Malaysia plane crash: What we know MH17: Our special report Who were the victims?  The plane lost contact with air traffic control about 50km (30 miles) from the Russia-Ukraine border.  Media captionIn 2015, the Dutch Safety Board released an animated video showing the flight path of the plane  It crashed in the Donetsk area, in territory controlled by pro-Russian separatists.  Footage was later released by the Ukrainian government suggesting that a Buk missile had been brought in from Russia on the day of the crash, and then taken back across the border the next day.\u00a0 What has been said about the incident?  In October 2015 the Dutch Safety Board concluded that the plane had indeed been hit by a Buk missile.  How does a Buk missile system work?  In September 2016, the JIT - which includes officials from the Netherlands, Australia, Belgium, Malaysia and Ukraine - reached a similar conclusion in a preliminary report.\u00a0  It said it had \"irrefutable evidence\" that the missile had been brought in from Russian territory and fired from a field controlled by pro-Russian fighters.  The investigators simulated various trajectories of the warhead. They showed it had exploded metres above the aeroplane's nose, showering the aircraft with fragments.  On Thursday Russia restated its position that none of its forces had been involved. \"Not a single anti-aircraft missile system from the Russian Federation has ever crossed the Russia-Ukraine border,\" the defence ministry in Moscow said.  Meanwhile\u00a0Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko promised in a Facebook post (in Ukrainian) that he would \"spare no effort to ensure that the actions of the Russian Federation as a state which supports terrorism get an appropriate assessment\"\u00a0in the International Court of Justice.      Putin's Russia and 'Disinformation' (07/04/18)  While Russia continues to pour out disinformation about the\u00a0chemical weapon attack in Salisbury, here's how the Kremlin responded to the independent investigation into the biggest doping scandal in world sport - there's ever been.  If you ask me, Jeremy Corbyn supporters and their fellow conspiracy theorists are being had - big time!  \u00a0 Putin's Russia (15/12/18) \"Nothing to see here, move along\", seems to be the response of Putin's Russian into the biggest doping scandal there's ever been.  The\u00a0independent report was carried out at the request of WADA (World Anti Doping Agency) \u00a0 and exposes cheating on an\u00a0industrial scale - not just on the part of individual\u00a0athletes and rouge\u00a0coaches, but at the highest levels of the Russian state.  Read the\u00a0following report from the BBC which includes a link to McLaren's findings in relation to the London Olympics in 2012 and further Olympic events in 2013 and 2014.  Doping is the\u00a0course of modern sport, from the Olympic Games to professional cycling, yet instead of being part of the solution the Russian Government under President Putin\u00a0appears to be a huge part of the problem.  http://www.bbc.com/sport/38261608  Russian doping: McLaren report says more than 1,000 athletes implicated  BBC\u00a0Sport The report's author, Richard McLaren (centre), said doping took place on 'an unprecedented scale'  More than 1,000 Russians - including Olympic medallists - benefited from a state-sponsored doping programme between 2011 and 2015, a report claims.  At least 30 sports, including football, covered up samples, the report says.  \"It was a cover-up that evolved from uncontrolled chaos to an institutionalised and disciplined medal-winning conspiracy,\" said the report's author, Richard McLaren.  Lawyer McLaren said London 2012 was \"corrupted on an unprecedented scale\".  The report also implicates medallists at the 2013 World Athletics Championships in Moscow, and the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi.  According to the report, salt and coffee were used to manipulate Russian samples.  The report added the system was refined over the course of the 2012 Olympics, 2013 Worlds and Winter Olympics to protect likely Russian medal winners.  Russia doping - How we got here Life on the run for Russian whistleblower  Russia won 72 medals at the London Games, 21 of which were gold, and 33 medals at Sochi, 13 of which were gold.  McLaren's second report added depth and supporting evidence to the initial findings published in July - that Russia operated a state-sponsored doping programme.  That first report was met with denials from Russia and calls for more proof from the International Olympic Committee (IOC).  Writing in his latest report, McLaren says: \"The desire to win medals superseded their collective moral and ethical compass and Olympic values of fair play.\"  He said international sports competitions had been \"unknowingly hijacked by the Russians\" and sports fans have been \"deceived\" for years.  \"It is time that stops,\" he added.  In a statement,\u00a0Russia's sports ministry\u00a0said it would examine the report but insisted on \"the absence of a state programme of support for doping sport\". It said it would \"continue to fight doping from a position of zero tolerance\".  Russian MP Dmitry Svishchev, who is also the head of Russia's Curling Federation, was quoted by Ria Novosti news agency as saying: \"This is what we expected. There's nothing new, only empty allegations against all of us. If you are Russian, you'll get accused of every single sin.\"  When asked for a reaction to those comments, McLaren said: \"I would say read the report. Its findings are not challengeable. He is reacting in a vacuum because he has not read the report.\"  The new report also found:At the Sochi Games, two Russian female ice hockey players had male urine samples.A total of 15 Russian medal winners at London 2012 were implicated [10 medals have since been taken away].The samples of 12 medal-winning athletes at Sochi 2014 had evidence of tampering.Six winners of 21 Paralympic medals at Sochi had their samples tampered with.Emails were found asking for instructions from the Russian Ministry of Sport on what to do with a positive sample - save or quarantine?Spreadsheets were found containing lists of athletes whose samples had been saved.A clean urine bank was kept in Moscow.A cocktail of drugs - known as the \"Duchess\" - with a very short detection window was developed to assist athletes in evading doping.Salt and instant coffee granules were added to clean urine samples to match the appearance of the positive samples.Three samples at Sochi had salt readings that were physiologically impossible.Investigators have published a searchable database of all the non-confidential evidence they have gathered\u00a0here.  The full report can be read\u00a0here. How urine sample swapping worked  The first McLaren report explained how\u00a0disappearing positive drug tests\u00a0were secreted through \"mouse holes\" drilled by spies.\u00a0 That was based on information received from Dr Grigory Rodchenkov, a director of the anti-doping laboratory at Sochi 2014.  He had said the Russian secret service developed ways of opening sample bottles and replacing their contents without intervention being detected.\u00a0 He had said the Russian secret service developed ways of opening sample bottles and replacing their contents without intervention being detected. The new report claims to have compiled clear details on exactly how the sample bottles in Sochi were tampered with.  The new report claims to have compiled clear details on exactly how the sample bottles in Sochi were tampered with.  Investigators used a tool which matched the description of one used by the FSB (Russian Federal Security Service), which leaves tiny marks and scratches when the inside of a cap is opened.An expert was given 13 bottles, one of which had not been tampered with, which he immediately spotted.\u00a0In cases of alleged sample swapping, investigators found there were scratches and marks on the inside of the cap, along with DNA inconsistencies.  Analysis -\u00a0BBC sports editor Dan Roan Once again the gory details of Russian state-sponsored cheating have been laid bare by Professor Richard McLaren.  The difference now is those claims have been backed up with concrete evidence.  Some of the details really do defy belief, and the fact the Russian government is so strongly implicated will inevitably lead to calls for Russian athletes to be banned from the 2018 Winter Olympics, and perhaps even for the 2018 football World Cup to be taken away from the country. Reaction - 'hugely significant'  The IOC said the report showed \"there was a fundamental attack on the integrity of the Olympic Games and on sport in general\".  It said it would re-analyse all 254 urine samples collected from Russian athletes at Sochi 2014.  UK Anti-Doping chief executive Nicole Sapstead said the report was \"hugely significant for sport and those who fight to keep it clean\".  She added: \"Everyone engaged in sport needs to ensure that the right processes, sanctions and safeguards are in place to protect everyone's right to clean, fair and honest sport.\"  She also called for more funding to support investigations.  Travis Tygart, chief executive of the United States Anti-Doping Agency said the Russian Olympic Committee should be suspended, and no sporting events should be held in the country until \"all the individuals who participated in the corruption are held accountable\".  The International Paralympic Committee (IPC) described the report's findings as \"unprecedented and astonishing\", adding: \"They strike right at the heart of the integrity and ethics of sport.\"  The International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF), the body that governs world athletics, said: \"It is time that this manipulation stops.\" It said it will take further action once it is able to examine the latest report.  British marathon world record holder Paula Radcliffe said Russia had committed a \"huge fraud\". She added: \"We need to know this cannot happen ever again.\"  Katherine Grainger, Britain's most decorated female Olympian, told BBC Radio 5 live: \"This is a reminder that, along with all those high points in sport, there is a very dark side. It's depressing and it's slightly soul-destroying that it's on this scale.\"  Paralympic table tennis champion Will Bayley said: \"I do have compassion for the athletes. Because if they were forced into it, and they are never going to be able to compete in the sport that they love, then that's really sad.\"  UK sports minister Tracey Crouch said: \"The sheer scale of what has been uncovered underlines just how much more needs to be done.  \"We will continue to assist on this front, including in Russia, where UK Anti-Doping is assisting Wada by managing a testing programme that we hope will lead to Russia becoming compliant with the Wada.\" What is the reaction in Russia?  Stanislav Pozdnyakov, vice-president of the Russian Olympic Committee, told state news agency R-Sport the report contains \"nothing new\".  He said Russian athletes \"should train calmly\" for the 2018 Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, South Korea.  Igor Lebedev, deputy speaker of the Russian parliament and a member of the executive committee of the Russian Football Federation, said: \"This is yet another torrent of lies, disinformation, rumours and fables.\"  Natalia Gart, president of the Russian Luge Federation, said: \"Where are the facts? You can say this is nothing but rubbish... I am convinced that all of our athletes are clean and the silver medals that we won at Sochi are well deserved.\" What is Russia doing about doping?  The Russian Investigations Committee - the country's main anti-corruption body - continues to investigate criminal cases that have been launched.  The committee says 60 athletes have so far been questioned.  Senior officials from Russia's sports ministry, its anti-doping agency and the Russian Athletics Federation are also said to have been questioned.  On Wednesday, Russia's anti-doping agency (Rusada) appointed former double Olympic pole vault champion Yelena Isinbayeva to chair its new board.  The move was questioned by the World Anti-Doping Agency (Wada), which said Rusada broke an agreement it would be consulted before any appointment was made.  Isinbayeva, 34, was strongly critical of Wada's recommendation that all Russian athletes be banned from Rio 2016.  McLaren was asked whether Russians athletes could be trusted in the future.  He said: \"I think the answer to that is yes but they need to reform themselves. I've spoken with many Russian officials since July and they are putting together a very comprehensive programme which, if implemented properly, will make a major difference.\" What could happen next?  Wada says it will now pass evidence on Russian athletes' doping to the relevant international sporting federations and governing bodies.  In a news conference on Thursday, IOC president Thomas Bach said the McLaren report's findings would be taken up by two further commissions.  Only once those commissions had made their recommendations could the IOC decide what steps to take, he said.  \"As soon as we have the report it will be handed over to the two commissions, who have already undertaken preparatory work,\" Bach said.  \"But if you ask me for my private opinion then personally if you have an athlete being part of such a manipulation system, clearly I would not like to see this person compete again.\"  More on the IOC's two commissions The IOC says its 'Inquiry Commission', chaired by former president of Switzerland Samuel Schmid, will address the \"institutional conspiracy across summer and winter sports athletes\" with particular regard to Sochi 2014. Its 'Disciplinary Commission', chaired by IOC member Denis Oswald, will address \"doping and manipulation of samples concerning the Russian athletes who participated at Sochi 2014\". What has already been done?  In May, McLaren was tasked by Wada with investigating allegations of doping in Russia.  He published the first part of his report - stating Russia operated a\u00a0state-sponsored doping programme\u00a0from 2011 - in July.  As a result, Wada recommended all Russian athletes be banned from competing from the Rio 2016 Olympics and Paralympics.  But the IOC chose not to impose a blanket ban, instead leaving decisions on whether Russians could compete to individual sporting federations.  Russia eventually took 271 athletes from an original entry list of 389 competitors to August's Olympic Games in Rio.  However, the IPC chose to ban the nation entirely from the Paralympics in September.  Last week, the IAAF has decided to\u00a0extend Russia's ban\u00a0from international competitions.  Putin's Russia (18/06/16) The international athletics federation (IAAF) has banned Russian athletes from taking part in the 2016 Olympic Games in Brazil because of suspected drug\u00a0cheating on an industrial scale, which has to mean that the Russian Government is\u00a0involved not just individual athletes.  The BBC reports on the refusal of Russian\u00a0authorities to co-operate with the recent WADA\u00a0investigation which makes a mockery of attempts to drive the drug cheats out of sport.  Meanwhile President Putin makes a dumb joke about the impossibility of just a few hundred, extremely violent Russian football fans 'beating up' several thousand rival English supporters during the Euro championships.  But the live TV coverage of what happened inside the ground speaks for itself as does the fact that the Russian football federation was the only one to be fined over the thuggish behaviour of its fans.\u00a0    Russia doping: New Wada report reveals obstructions to testing  Russian athletes have been banned from competing in international competitions since November 2015  Anti-doping officials in Russia are being stopped from testing athletes and are also being threatened by security services, says a new report.  The World Anti-Doping Agency (Wada) made its latest claims two days before Russia finds out whether it can send athletes to the 2016 Rio Olympics.  They were banned from international competition after Wada accused Russia of state-sponsored doping.  Athletics chiefs meet on Friday to decide whether to lift the ban. What does the Wada report say?  It says that:73 of 455 tests on athletes could not be collected;736 tests were declined or cancelled;23 tests were missed, which the report says is a \"significant amount\";and 52 findings were adverse.The report details the lengths athletes from different sports allegedly went to, both to avoid tests and fool doping control officers (DCOs).  It says one athlete was seen running away from the mixed zone after an event, while another left the stadium during a race and could not be located.  Wada also highlighted the case of an athlete who, it says, used a container - \"presumably containing clean urine\" - that had been inserted inside her.  When she tried to use the container, it leaked onto the floor.  The athlete is alleged to have tried to bribe the DCO before providing a sample that subsequently returned an adverse finding.  The report also says that:DCOs have been intimidated when accessing military cities, with armed federal security agents threatening them with expulsion from the country;Wada-accredited laboratories have reported that sample transportation packages have been opened by Russian customs, suggesting interference by officials;And national championships for Olympic sports, including Olympic qualifiers, have been held in cities with restricted access due to ongoing civil conflicts, resulting in service providers declining test requests.As a result, tests were not carried out at the national weightlifting and national Greco-Roman wrestling championships.  In some cases, testers were not told where an event was taking place.  \"What really comes through, when you read through it page by page by page, is the number of occasions when there was simply no co-operation given,\" former Wada president Dick Pound told the BBC World Service. Why are Russian athletes banned?  The International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) voted to suspend Russia's athletics federation on 13 November after an independent\u00a0Wada report\u00a0alleged \"state-sponsored doping\".  The report was commissioned to investigate claims made in a documentary shown by\u00a0German broadcaster ARD\u00a0in 2014.  The programme alleged widespread doping in Russian athletics, claiming as many as 99% of athletes had cheated.  The claims were made by whistleblowers, among them Vitaly Stepanov, a former Russian anti-doping official, and his wife Yulia, a former 800m runner who was banned for doping.  Russian athletes, including former London Marathon winner Liliya Shobukhova, also admitted to taking drugs and observing corruption.  The Wada report found evidence of state involvement, as well as evidence that samples had been destroyed, doping controls had been interfered and bribes had been paid to conceal positive tests.  What happens next?  The IAAF meets on Friday in Vienna to discuss what Russian authorities have done to tackle doping and whether its athletes should compete in Rio.  Russian sports minister Vitaly Mutko said the country could take legal action if its athletics federation was not reinstated, Interfax news agency has reported.  \"It is a big and an important message whatever is decided,\" said Pound.  \"If they are held to be excluded, that's a message. If they are allowed to come back in, there is going to be another message that all of the sporting authorities are going to have to deal with.\"  Pound said a ban on Russian athletes competing in the Olympics would be extremely difficult for the Russian government to explain to its citizens.  \"You can explain all sorts of economic sanctions and political sanctions and what not if you are the state,\" he said.  \"But it is very hard to explain to a country that really enjoys its sport and likes to watch it why it is that nobody will play with you.\"  Meanwhile, Russian Olympic medallists and world champions have appealed to the head of the International Olympic Committee to let athletes with no history of doping to compete at the Rio Games.  \"The fraud of dishonest people should not jeopardise the career of innocent fellow athletes,\" said 13 sports stars in a letter to Thomas Bach.  The 13 include Alexander Popov, a four-time Olympic champion swimmer, and judo champion Tagir Khaibulaev.  The Olympic athletics programme begins in Brazil on 12 August. Russian Alexander Popov won four freestyle swimming Olympic golds Russian Dopes (10/11/15)  The World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) is an independent organisation\u00a0charged with cleaning up international athletics and has just concluded that the Russian state, not just individual\u00a0athletes, has been\u00a0actively involved in cheating and\u00a0corruption on a\u00a0massive scale.  Predictably, Russia's response has been to rubbish WADA's investigation and to accuse other countries of\u00a0engaging in a groundless conspiracy, even though the evidence\u00a0against Russian athletes and officials is\u00a0incontrovertible.  The BBC reports on a 'betrayal\", a \"destruction of\u00a0public faith\" and a\"dark day\" for\u00a0athletics\" against the background of the WADA logo 'Play True'. \u00a0  \u00a0 Doping & corruption report a 'dark day' for athletics    A \"betrayal\", a \"destruction of public faith\" and a \"dark day\" for athletics. Leading figures have responded to a\u00a0World Anti-Doping Agency commission report,\u00a0which has recommended Russia should be banned from competition.  British sports minister Tracey Crouch called the findings an \"extraordinarily dark day for athletics\".  The report examines claims of doping, cover-ups, and extortion in Russian athletics, which also implicated the IAAF, the sport's world governing body.  The report also states the London 2012 Olympics were \"sabotaged\" by participation of Russian athletes under suspicion, while Dick Pound - head of the independent commission - described it as \"state-sponsored doping\".  Athletics' darkest day?  IAAF president Lord Coe described the scale and depth of the report's findings \"truly shocking\".  After promising to \"move quickly\" on the independent commission's recommendations, Coe told BBC Sport: \"I want to see a sport that is responsible and transparent and accountable and I will do anything it takes to achieve that. But this will not be swift road, this will be tough.\"  Former British Olympian Roger Black echoed Crouch's reaction, telling BBC Radio 4's Today programme: \"If you're looking at a governing body as corrupt, and they are protecting the guilty athletes, then that changes everything going forward.  \"There's always been an assumption that your governing body is there for you as an athlete, and is there to sort out the cheats.  \"It's a very dark day.\"  Tessa Jowell, former Olympics minister, added: \"This is what destroys public faith in the competition they see on their televisions or go to see. There is very clear a problem of culture.\"  What the athletes say  Paula Radcliffe, marathon world record holder,\u00a0on Twitter:\u00a0\"Just got off plane to catch up on these damning and serious revelations. Too much to address in tweets: bottom line - truth eventually comes.  \"Suspected some of this for years but way worse than imagined. Athletics needs to take strong action and move quickly forward in right direction.\"   London 2012 long jump champion Greg Rutherford posted a message on Instagram  Louise Hazel, British heptathlete: \"I am disappointed but I am not surprised that doping continues to be rife through the world of athletics.  \"I have been in situations where I have seen athletes doping right before my eyes.  \"Giving athletes a two-year ban and allowing them to come back to compete for gold medals is just not good enough. Full-time bans and you are out of the sport. Simple as that.\"  Mara Yamauchi, second fastest British female marathon runner of all time: \"I'm not very surprised, it helps to explain a lot of the suspicions I've had about particularly Russian athletes who I used to compete against.  \"It's easy to direct your anger at the athletes but actually what this story really shows is that the serious wrongdoing is going on further up the chain on the part of agents, coaches, officials, directors of anti-doping and national federations and it's really those people that should be punished.\" British 400m hurdler Dai Greene commented on Twitter about Wada's findings Lynsey Sharp, who represented Britain in the 800m at London 2012, also reacted on Twitter Former heptathlete and 400m runner Kelly Sotherton represented Britain at the 2004 and 2008 Olympics   Katharine Merry won 400m bronze at the Sydney Olympics in 2000 Official bodies react to Wada findings  Wada president Sir Craig Reedie told BBC Radio 5 live:\u00a0\"I think it's appalling and is probably worse than anyone imagined.

But in truth the problems have been obvious for some time and my favourite\u00a0example is\u00a0about the cyclist who tried to explain away packs of\u00a0fresh blood in his travel\u00a0kitchen by claiming that these were for making black puddings. Yet the chap is still competes to this day, as far as I know.  Doping culture in cycling 'still exists' according to Circ report   By Matt Slater - BBC Sport  Cycling continues to struggle with widespread doping, according to a landmark report into the sport's troubled recent history.  Set up last January to investigate how cycling so badly lost its way during the 1990s and 2000s, the Cycling Independent Reform Commission (Circ) has heavily criticised the sport's leadership throughout that era.  Its 227-page report, published on Monday, clears the International Cycling Union's (UCI) bosses of outright corruption but censures them for a litany of failings.  Foremost among these are that the UCI did not really want to catch cheats and therefore turned a blind eye to anything but the worst excesses.  The report's authors also accuse former UCI presidents Hein Verbruggen and Pat McQuaid of failing to follow their own anti-doping rules and showing preferential treatment to disgraced former champion Lance Armstrong.  A total of 174 anti-doping experts, officials, riders and other interested parties were interviewed. These are the main points: One \"respected cycling professional\" believes that 90% of the peloton is still doping, another put it at 20%Riders are micro-dosing, taking small but regular amounts of a banned substance, to fool the latest detection methodsThe abuse of Therapeutic Use Exemptions, sick notes, is commonplace, with one rider saying 90% of these are used to boost performanceThe use of weight-loss drugs, experimental medicine and powerful painkillers is widespread, leading to eating disorders, depression and even crashesWith doping done now on a more conservative basis, other forms of cheating are on the rise, particularly related to bikes and equipmentDoping in amateur cycling is endemicThe \u20ac3m (\u00a32.16m) report was compiled by chairman Dr Dick Marty, a former Swiss prosecutor, and two vice-chairs, German anti-doping expert Professor Ulrich Haas and Peter Nicholson, an Australian who has investigated international terrorism and war crimes.  UCI president Brian Cookson,\u00a0who swept into office in 2013\u00a0promising a fresh start for an organisation that had been badly damaged by its close links to Armstrong, thanked the panel for its work and did not try to sugar-coat its findings.  \"It is clear that in the past the UCI suffered severely from a lack of good governance with individuals taking crucial decisions alone,\" said Cookson.  \"Many [of these decisions] undermined anti-doping efforts; put the UCI in an extraordinary position of proximity to certain riders; and wasted a lot of its time and resources in open conflict with organisations such as the World Anti-Doping Agency (Wada) and US Anti-Doping Agency (Usada).\"  Cookson added that his predecessors and their close associates regularly interfered in anti-doping cases which \"served to erode confidence in the UCI and the sport\". Siege mentality and a fallen hero  The issues that Cookson is referring to are dealt with over 120 pages of forensic detail.  The report explains how a sport that had always taken a lenient approach to doping, and had an entrenched, Mafia-like culture of \"omerta\" when it came to not talking about doping, entered a new phase when the \"game-changing\" blood-boosting drug EPO became readily available in the early 1990s.  With no test for it until 2000 and performance benefits of 10-15%, it did not take long before almost everybody in the sport was using it. As the report says, \"it would have been hard to overestimate the prevalence of drug use in the peloton\" at this time.  BBC sports editor Dan Roan  \"The report should be studied by every sport, because while cycling is still clearly in a critical condition, it at least knows it is ill\"  Read\u00a0Dan Roan's full analysis\u00a0of the Circ report  Numerous interviewees told Circ the UCI's view was it should only try to contain the problem and make sure the riders did not kill themselves, and that actually catching cheats was bad for the sport's reputation.  It was against this backdrop that Verbruggen took control of what had been an insignificant governing body and turned it into a far larger and more ambitious entity.  According to the report, the Dutchman had almost dictatorial powers at the UCI between 1991 and 2005, and continued to exert influence under the reign of his hand-picked successor, Irishman McQuaid.  The pair will be relieved to have been cleared of the most serious allegations against them, namely that they were bribed by Armstrong to cover up positive tests in 2001; and that he paid for what was meant to be an independent report commissioned by the UCI to investigate reports he had tested positive during the 1999 Tour de France.  But Circ did not spare them on a number of glaring errors of judgement and examples of poor governance:World champion Laurent Brochard in 1997 and Armstrong in 1999 were both allowed to backdate medical prescriptions to avoid sanctions, a clear breach of the anti-doping rulesMcQuaid abruptly and unilaterally changed his mind to allow Armstrong to ride at the 2009 Tour Down Under despite not being available for testing for the required six months beforehand. At the same time it was announced that Armstrong would later that season ride in the Tour of Ireland, an event organised by what is described in the report as \"people known to McQuaid\"While Armstrong did not pay for the 2006 report into his alleged positive tests at the 1999 Tour, his lawyers did draft large sections of it, along with senior UCI staff desperate to shift blame away from the rider and onto the laboratory that leaked the results and WadaThe UCI asked for and accepted two large donations from Armstrong, and enquired about a more regular gift as late as 2008Repeatedly came out to defend Armstrong against accusations of cheating, supporting him in two high-profile legal casesThere is also considerable criticism of the UCI's cost controls, ethics procedures and electoral practices, with Verbruggen and McQuaid accused of breaches of the rules in the 2005 and 2013 elections.  The Lance Armstrong story  Born: Plano, Texas on 18 September 1971  Tour de France victories: 1999, 2000, 2001, 2002, 2003, 2004, 2005 (22 individual stage wins)  World Championships road race victory: 1993  Cancer survivor: Diagnosed with testicular cancer in 1996. The disease spreads through his body. Launches Lance Armstrong Foundation for Cancer. Declared cancer-free in 1997 after brain surgery and chemotherapy  Retirement: Announces he will retire after the 2005 Tour de France, which he wins. Angered by drug allegations against him, Armstrong announces in September 2008 he will return to professional cycling. In June 2010, he reveals via Twitter that the 2010 Tour de France will be his last. On 16 February 2011, Armstrong announces retirement again.  Both men have reacted by welcoming the report's central finding that there is no evidence of corruption or direct collusion in any of the numerous doping scandals that beset the sport on their watch, with Verbruggen telling the BBC: \"How can I be annoyed about being cleared of cover-ups and bribes?\"  He added that it is \"so easy to rewrite history 25 years later\".  One man who would dearly love to rewrite history is Armstrong,\u00a0who told the BBC last month\u00a0he hoped his two interviews with Circ would lead to the panel recommending a reduction in his lifetime ban from almost all organised sport.  The former icon will be bitterly disappointed, then, that Circ has not exercised its right to ask Usada to reconsider its sanction, despite noting on more than one occasion that his treatment is inconsistent with almost every other member of his team, not to mention the vast majority of riders he competed against.  Armstrong told the BBC he was \"grateful\" to Circ for letting him help with the report and said he was \"deeply sorry for many things I have done\".\u00a0 The job is never done  While many senior figures within the sport will be feeling very bruised by the report's assessment of what happened during the EPO era, Circ did acknowledge the huge improvements made in the anti-doping effort, particularly after 2006.  It noted a far more aggressive approach to catching cheats, greater investment in anti-doping and the early adoption of the biological passport, the most effective tool in the fight against cheats since the EPO test was introduced in 2000.  Lance Armstrong admits doping to win cycling titles  But the interviewees also made it clear that doping had not been eradicated.  The report listed dozens of substances and cutting-edge doping methods that riders are still believed to use. It also noted that teams do not know where their riders are training at all times, or with whom they are training.  The ready availability and falling costs of doping products is also flagged up as a huge concern, as is the continuing involvement of a number of unethical doctors.  The report concludes with a raft of recommendations to help prevent cycling from ever returning to the dark days of a decade ago, with ideas such as centralised pharmacies at races, a powerful riders' union, a greater push to encourage whistleblowing and more testing done overnight to catch micro-dosers. Cycling Cheats (10/05/13)  The Spanish authorities have finally caught up with the doctor - Eufemiano Fuentes -\u00a0behind the outrageous cheating that has been taking place for years in the cynical world of professional cycling.  Fuentes was sentenced to one year in prison by\u00a0a Spanish Court and also banned from practising as a sports doctor for four years - although any\u00a0right thinking person will be asking why this crook was not\u00a0banned for life and locked up for a long time.  Because he's a dishonest criminal fraudster\u00a0whose willingness to ignore\u00a0the medical ethics of his profession has helped people win big prize money\u00a0in top flight cycling events -\u00a0by cheating others who were playing by the rules.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  The corrupt doctor\u00a0carried out blood transfusions on some of the world's top cyclists\u00a0and Fuentes is only now being punished\u00a0- seven years after police raided his Madrid laboratories and found dozens of bags of refrigerated and frozen blood - marked with code names for his many customers.  Many of the bags belonged to cyclists who had left blood with Fuentes so that they could be re-infused with it during races in order to improve their performance - including\u00a0the Olympic-medal winner Tyler Hamilton.  The aim of the\u00a0transfusion was to artificially improve a cyclist's performance by increasing their red blood cell count and - in addition - Fuentes\u00a0supplied his clients with\u00a0banned substances, including\u00a0testosterone, insulin, and hormones.  The Spanish judge said that Fuentes had put the\u00a0health of the cyclists at great risk - by\u00a0increasing\u00a0their chances of suffering from thrombosis, heart attacks, nausea and vomiting - as well as an increased risk of doing\u00a0damage to their kidneys and brain.  But incredibly the judge refused to release the unused transfusion bags to sporting and other authorities so that the identities of others involved in the scandal could be tracked down and brought to justice.  Justice of a sort that is because Fuentes is unlikely to even set foot in prison - since\u00a0sentences under two years are normally suspended in Spain.Putin's Russia (06/03/18)  The BBC reports on a incident in the normally quiet county of Wiltshire involving a former Russian spy, Sergei Skripal, who appears to be the victim of some kind of mysterious poisoning.  Lots more to follow on this story I'm sure including, no doubt, a statement from President Vladimir Putin denying any\u00a0involvement of the Russian state.  Putin's denial will follow a long line of similar\u00a0denials such as: The murder of\u00a0Alexander Litvinenko with\u00a0radioactive Polonium in 2006Team Russia's systematic cheating in the Sochi Winter Olympics 2014The shooting down of civilian Flight MH17 over Eastern Ukraine in 2014Large-scale, organised Russian interference in America's presidential election in 2016In addition many of Putin's internal critics have died\u00a0suddenly\u00a0and violently including the Russian journalist\u00a0Anna Politkovskaya and opposition\u00a0politician Boris Nemtsov, both of whom were gunned down by\u00a0assassins in Moscow. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-43295134  Critically ill man is former Russian spy Media caption - \"He was doing strange hand movements, looking up to the sky\":\u00a0 What we know so far  A man who is critically ill after being exposed to an unknown substance in Wiltshire is a Russian national convicted of spying for Britain, the BBC understands.  Sergei Skripal, 66, was granted refuge in the UK following a \"spy swap\" between the US and Russia in 2010.  He and a woman, 33,\u00a0were found unconscious on a bench at a shopping centre\u00a0in Salisbury on Sunday.  Zizzi restaurant in Salisbury has been closed by police \"as a precaution\".  The substance has not been identified.  Wiltshire Police are investigating whether a crime has been committed. They said the pair\u00a0had no visible injuries\u00a0but had been found unconscious at the Maltings shopping centre.  They have declared a \"major incident\" and multiple agencies are investigating. They said it had not been declared as a counter-terrorism incident, but they were keeping an \"open mind\".  They said officers did not believe there was any risk to the wider public.  Col Skripal, who is a retired Russian military intelligence officer, was jailed for 13 years by Russia in 2006 for spying for Britain. Sergei Skripal: Who is the former Russian colonel?He was convicted of passing the identities of Russian intelligence agents working undercover in Europe to the UK's Secret Intelligence Service, MI6.  Russia said Col Skripal had been paid $100,000 for the information, which he had been supplying from the 1990s.  He was one of four prisoners released by Moscow in exchange for 10 US spies in 2010, as part of a swap. Col Skripal was later flown to the UK.  He and the woman, who police said were known to each other, are both in intensive care at Salisbury District Hospital.  Media caption - Witness: \"They looked like they'd been taking something quite strong\"  A number of locations in the city centre were cordoned off and teams in full protective gear used hoses to decontaminate the street.  The hospital advised people to attend routine operations and outpatient appointments unless they were contacted. It said its A&E department was open but busy because of the weather.  Neighbours at Sergei Skripal's home in Salisbury say police arrived around 17:00 GMT on Sunday and have been there ever since.  They said he was friendly and in recent years had lost his wife.  Media caption - Temp Asst Chief Constable Craig Holden: \"We are unable to ascertain whether or not a crime has taken place\"  Eyewitness Freya Church told the BBC it looked like the two people had taken \"something quite strong\".  She said: \"On the bench there was a couple, an older guy and a younger girl. She was sort of leant in on him, it looked like she had passed out maybe.  \"He was doing some strange hand movements, looking up to the sky...  \"They looked so out of it I thought even if I did step in I wasn't sure how I could help.\"\u00a0  Image caption - Public Health England has not confirmed what the substance was Image caption - The hospital's A&E was closed on Monday while two people were treated  The BBC's security correspondent Gordon Corera said government officials were not commenting about events in Salisbury, but that the possibility of an unexplained substance being involved will draw comparisons with the 2006 poisoning of Alexander Litvinenko.  Mr Litvinenko was a former intelligence officer who,\u00a0an inquiry later found,\u00a0was probably killed on the orders of Vladimir Putin.  Public Health England said its specialists would be joining a \"specially convened group\" to consider the incident. What were the charges against Col Skripal?  Col Skripal was convicted of \"high treason in the form of espionage\" by Moscow's military court in August 2006. He was stripped off all his titles and awards.  He was alleged by the Russian security service FSB to have begun working for the British secret services while serving in the army in the 1990s.  He had been passing information classified as state secrets and been paid for the work by MI6, the FSB claimed.  Col Skripal pleaded guilty at his trial and co-operated with investigators, reports said at the time.",

                "text": "The post I had originally scheduled for this week has been purposely delayed. I received a comment from a Vatican II sect apologist, Mr.\u00a0Aaron Debusschere, who recently set up his own blog entitled \"The Romantic Catholic.\" The author was polite and informed me that he had written a rebuttal to one of my past posts on the Vatican II Constitution Gaudium et Spes. He then invited me to respond if I wanted to do so. Never being one to run from a challenge, and always eager to defend the One True Church against all enemies, especially the Vatican II sect, this post is dedicated to showing the faulty premise upon which Mr.\u00a0Debusschere (hereinafter \"Mr. D\") attempts to refute me and defend the sect of Bergoglio. For my readers who would like a full background, please read my post on Gaudium et Spes at introiboadaltaredei2.blogspot.com/2020/08/vatican-ii-misery-and-despair.html. Then read the attempted rebuttal at theromanticcatholic.wordpress.com/2021/01/10/contra-sedevacantism. \u00a0I highly recommend doing so, if you have the time, in order to get a fuller appreciation for what follows here. I hope and pray Mr. D is of good will, and as a result of this exchange, he may leave the Vatican II sect and enter the real Catholic Church. Preliminary ConsiderationsIn my post of August 10, 2020, I stated that Vatican II's \"Constitution on the Church in the Modern World\" (Gaudium et Spes), was a catalogue of heresies, and I demonstrated four of them: 1. Universalism, 2. The Deification of Humans, 3. Falsifying the Words of Christ to Place Man As God, and 4.\u00a0False Principles Regarding Marriage and Women.\u00a0 Mr. D's defense is\u00a0the usual fare served up by Vatican II sect apologists; there is nothing wrong with the documents of Vatican II. Traditionalists misinterpret and misrepresent what they really teach which is in perfect harmony with all prior Church teaching. He writes, \"...to reject Vatican II would be to cease being Catholic.\" Quite the opposite is true, acceptance of Vatican II is rejection of Catholicism, which is the precise reason I'm a sedevacantist. His incorrect premise is that documents of his sect are to be \"read in context\" without reference to the authoritative interpretations of the men he recognizes as \"popes.\"\u00a0 What his Vatican II sect Magisterium decrees must be considered the true and binding interpretation--period.\u00a0\u00a0 Before attacking the points I made, Mr. D informs us: That being said, there are others who recognize\u00a0the necessary result of sedevantism and embrace it, all the while professing to be the truly faithful Catholics and condemning the \u201cVatican II sect\u201d of the real schism. This still leaves the sedevacantist to answer for the problem of a Church on earth with no Pope (an essential element of the Church) for several decades since most sedevacantists maintain that the Church has had no visible head since the death of Pius XII in 1958. Actually, there is no problem with the Church being in a prolonged state of sedevacante as both the Church's own approved theologians and history prove. I've written on this point several times, yet since Mr. D makes it an alleged \"weak spot\" for sedevacantism, it's worth reaffirming both the teaching and history. According to theologian Dorsch, \"The Church therefore is a society that is essentially monarchical. But this does not prevent the Church, for a short time after the death of a pope, OR EVEN FOR MANY YEARS, from remaining deprived of her head. [vel etiam per plures annos capite suo destituta manet]. Her monarchical form also remains intact in this state.\u2026Thus the Church is then indeed a headless body.\u2026 Her monarchical form of government remains, though then in a different way \u2014 that is, it remains incomplete and to be completed. The ordering of the whole to submission to her Primate is present, even though actual submission is not\u2026 For this reason, the See of Rome is rightly said to remain after the person sitting in it has died \u2014 for the See of Rome consists essentially in the rights of the Primate. These rights are an essential and necessary element of the Church. With them, moreover, the Primacy then continues, at least morally. The perennial physical presence of the person of the head, however, [perennitas autem physica personis principis] is not so strictly necessary.\" (de Ecclesia 2:196\u20137; Emphasis mine).\u00a0 Therefore, the Church can remain for many years deprived of a pope, and the form of government remains \"then in a different way.\" Moreover, there was a historical situation in the Church for 51 years called The Great Western Schism. From 1378 until 1429, when Pope Martin V became the universally recognized pontiff, there were up to three claimants to the papal throne, all with arguments for their legitimacy. Only one (or possibly none) could have been the true pope. As theologian Van Noort teaches, \"[During the Great Western Schism]...hierarchical unity was only materially, not formally, interrupted.\u00a0 Although Catholics were split three ways in their allegiance because of the doubt as to which of the [papal] contenders had been legitimately elected, still all were agreed in believing that allegiance was owed to one legitimate successor of Peter, and they stood willing to give that allegiance.\" (See Dogmatic Theology [1956] 2:131; First Emphasis in original, second emphasis mine). So too, Traditionalists stand \"willing to give that allegiance\" when there is a true pope.\u00a0 The real nail in the coffin was delivered by theologian Fr. Edmund James O'Reilly, one of the most orthodox and erudite theologians of the 19th century. He wrote a book in 1882 (a scant twelve years after the Vatican Council), entitled The Relations of the Church to Society \u2014 Theological Essays. On page 287, he writes in reference to the Great Western Schism: There had been anti-popes before from time to time, but never for such a continuance... nor ever with such a following...The great schism of the West suggests to me a reflection which I take the liberty of expressing here. If this schism had not occurred, the hypothesis of such a thing happening would appear to many chimerical. They would say it could not be; God would not permit the Church to come into so unhappy a situation. Heresies might spring up and spread and last painfully long, through the fault and to the perdition of their authors and abettors, to the great distress too of the faithful, increased by actual persecution in many places where the heretics were dominant. But that the true Church should remain between thirty and forty years without a thoroughly ascertained Head, and representative of Christ on earth, this would not be.\u00a0 Yet it has been; and we have no guarantee that it will not be again, though we may fervently hope otherwise. What I would infer is, that we must not be too ready to pronounce on what God may permit. We know with absolute certainty that He will fulfill His promises; not allow anything to occur at variance with them; that He will sustain His Church and enable her to triumph over all enemies and difficulties; that He will give to each of the faithful those graces which are needed for each one\u2019s service of Him and attainment of salvation, as He did during the great schism we have been considering, and in all the sufferings and trials which the Church has passed through from the beginning.\u00a0 We may also trust He will do a great deal more than what He has bound Himself to by His promises. We may look forward with a cheering probability to exemption for the future from some of the troubles and misfortunes that have befallen in the past. But we, or our successors in future generations of Christians, shall perhaps see stranger evils than have yet been experienced, even before the immediate approach of that great winding up of all things on earth that will precede the day of judgment. I am not setting up for a prophet, nor pretending to see unhappy wonders, of which I have no knowledge whatever. All I mean to convey is that contingencies regarding the Church, not excluded by the Divine promises, cannot be regarded as practically impossible, just because they would be terrible and distressing in a very high degree. (Emphasis mine). \u00a0The following points are made unmistakably clear:The Vatican Council's 1870 decree on the papacy has been misconstrued. The institution of the papacy is perpetual; there is no need nor guarantee of actual men to fill that See at every point in time.The Great Western Schism sets historical precedent for a de facto interregnum of 51 years, since no one knew which papal claimant was pope, and there was a real possibility that none of the claimants was Vicar of Christ.\u00a0The teaching of the theologians clearly shows a vacancy of the Holy See lasting for an extended period of time. Such a vacancy cannot be pronounced to be incompatible with the promises of Christ as to the Indefectibility of the Church.\u00a0 Therefore, all Four Marks, including Apostolicity and everything else the Church requires, continue of necessity, even if we may not know the exact answers in any given situation. The Magisterium would not allow theologians to teach a hypothetical situation as a real possibility, if that would somehow be incompatible with the dogma of Indefectibility and the promises of Christ.\u00a0It is also taught by the theologians that it would be exceedingly rash to set any prejudged limits as to what God will be prepared to allow to happen to the Holy See, except for that which would be contrary to Divine Law (such as a \"heretical pope\"--an oxymoron)Having shown Mr. D's argument against sedevacantism in general to be without merit, I will turn to his arguments against my claims of heresy in Gaudium et Spes; but I must point out a fatal flaw in his reasoning. He implicitly rejects the ability of the Magisterium to render a correct and binding interpretation of Vatican II's documents thereby using private interpretation. Ironically, this charge is usually (and falsely) leveled against sedevacantists. Here is what he writes: While his arguments were at best grasping at straws [not by a long shot], they may cause some of his readers to doubt the teachings of Vatican II [and reject them, I hope] while providing further support for those who already hold some form of opposition or malice toward the [pseudo-] Council and the [pseudo-] Magisterium; as such, I thought it may be worthwhile to provide a response both in defense of what the document actually says and what the Church actually teaches. I will, therefore, present here briefly the arguments made by Introibo followed by a more accurate reading of the text. Who will give us the \"more accurate reading of the text\"?\u00a0 How about \"Pope\" \"St.\" John Paul II? According to theologian Salaverri: \"We say in the thesis that an internal and religious assent of the mind is due to the doctrinal decrees of the Holy See, either formally published by the Supreme Pontiff or approved in the specific form by him, although they do not reach the grade of infallibility;...\"(See Sacrae Theologiae Summa IB, [1955], pg. 245; Emphasis in original). On the next page, Salaverri cites to the great encyclical of His Holiness Pope Pius XII, Humani Generis: \"Nor must it be thought that what is expounded in Encyclical Letters does not of itself demand consent, since in writing such Letters the Popes do not exercise the supreme power of their Teaching Authority. For these matters are taught with the ordinary teaching authority, of which it is true to say: \"He who heareth you, heareth me\"; and generally what is expounded and inculcated in Encyclical Letters already for other reasons appertains to Catholic doctrine. But if the Supreme Pontiffs in their official documents purposely pass judgment on a matter up to that time under dispute, it is obvious that that matter, according to the mind and will of the Pontiffs, cannot be any longer considered a question open to discussion among theologians.\" (para. #20; Emphasis mine).\u00a0 With this in mind, let's examine each of his attempted defenses against the charges of heresy in Gaudium et Spes (\"GS\"). Please note that once you see why the defense against the charge of Universalism fails, the rest fall pretty quickly.\u00a0 Attempted Defense Against The Charge of UniversalismIn GS para. #22 we read, For by His incarnation the Son of God has united Himself in some fashion with every man. I explained that if every man is united with Christ he cannot be damned.\u00a0 Wojtyla, a man Mr. D recognizes as both a pope and saint, taught in\u00a0Redemptor Hominis (1979), para. #13: Christ the Lord indicated this way especially, when, as the Council teaches, \"by his Incarnation, he, the Son of God, in a certain way united himself with each man\"(Emphasis in original). Continuing in the same encyclical, Wojtyla writes, Accordingly, what is in question here is man in all his truth, in his full magnitude. We are not dealing with the \"abstract\" man, but the real, \"concrete\", \"historical\" man. We are dealing with \"each\" man, for each one is included in the mystery of the Redemption and with each one Christ has united himself forever through this mystery. (Emphasis mine).\u00a0 Mr. D tells us that by reading the context of GS, \"It is clear that the fashion in which the Son of God united Himself with every man is by taking on human nature...\" and \"The union present by GS is that of a common human nature; he is consubstantial with each man in His manhood.\" Is this what Wojtyla is teaching? In a word: No. The background of Karol Wojtyla is in order. He is John Paul the Great Apostate because he does not have the Faith. According to theologian Tanquerey, Faith is \"the supernatural assent by which the intellect, under the command of the will and the influence of grace, firmly accepts revealed truths because of the authority of God Who is revealing.\" (See Dogmatic Theology 1:193). John Paul II sees Faith as \"an experiential state.\" Speaking to a group of clerics, Wojtyla said, \"To enter into dialogue with God means to allow oneself to be won over and conquered by the luminous figure of the Revealed Jesus, and by the love of the Father Who sent Him. It is in precisely this that the faith consists. In faith, man interiorly enlightened and attracted by God, goes beyond the limits of purely natural knowledge, and experiences God in a manner that would otherwise be impossible.\" As you can see, Wojtyla is a good Modernist who reduces \"faith\" from an act of the intellect to feelings and experiences. This is reflected in the Novus Bogus \"mass\" where human entertainment, feeling good about yourself, and the elimination of anything deemed \"negative theology\" (like sin and Hell) reign supreme.\u00a0 Wojtyla was a close friend of arch-Modernist Fr. Karl Rahner, whose teaching on the \"anonymous Christian\" was tantamount to universal salvation. Rahner was censured by Pope Pius XII, rehabilitated by Montini (Paul VI), and had a friend in Wojtyla who was greatly influenced by him. Wojtyla was also influenced by Fr. Teilhard de Chardin, who was a censured pantheist/evolutionist and died in 1955. The heretical Vatican II document Gaudium et Spes (The Constitution of the Church in the Modern World) had Wojtyla, Cardinal Montini ( the future Paul VI), Cardinal Suenens, and Cardinal Lecaro as the chief architects. All were Modernists to the core. Gaudium et Spes along with Lumen Gentium (Constitution on the Church), set the foundation for the new religion--the Vatican II sect. Lumen Gentium set up a false dichotomy between \"the Church of Christ\" and the Roman Catholic Church. In reality, they are identical, but this document of Vatican II falsely teaches that they are distinct. According to this Modernist document, the Church of Christ \"subsists\" in its fullness in the Catholic Church, but also subsists elsewhere in false sects according to how many \"elements' they have. To have all the elements is best, but to have just some is equally good and leads to salvation. As I wrote in my post, now under fire by Mr. D,\u00a0Gaudium et Spes teaches one of the trademark heresies of the Vatican II sect; the idea that by His Incarnation, Christ united himself with each man.\u00a0 Vatican II speaks of a union between Christ and each man that results from the incarnation itself.\u00a0 Wojtyla has taken this heresy and run with it full speed ahead to its logical consequence - universal salvation in a \"church\" that subsists everywhere.\u00a0 Wojtya rejects Thomism for phenomenology and personalism. (See\u00a0\"The Phenomenology of Karol Wojtyla. On the Problem of the Phenomenological Foundation of Anthropology,\" in: Philosophy and Phenomenological Research, Vol. 42 (1982), pp. 326-334 by Hans Kochler). As I stated, he admired heretic Teilhard de Chardin\u00a0(1881-1955).\u00a0On May 12, 1981, on the occasion of the centennial of the birth of the monistic-pantheistic Jesuit, Teilhard de Chardin, the Secretariat of State sent \"in the name of the Holy Father\" a highly laudatory and favorable letter to the rector of the Institut Catholique of Paris. In this message the \"pope\" praises \"the wonderful repercussions of his [Teilhard's] research and investigations as well as the marked influence of his personality and the richness of his thought.\" (See\u00a0L'Osservatore Romano, June 10, 1981). \"Richness of his thought\"?\u00a0 Teilhard's philosophy transformed the universe from a place in which we exist to a place that, through evolution, exists with us. Evolution, for Teilhard, is the hermeneutic key for understanding the place of Christ within the vast cosmos. Teilhard saw everything moving towards perfection\u2014which he called the Omega Point\u2014as a movement toward God that was simultaneously physical and spiritual. He called the transformation divinization, and saw humanity as currently passing through an evolutionary-spiritual dimension he termed the Noosphere, so that we can enter the final stages of the Pneumatosphere and become one with God. It's basically pantheism with evolution thrown in the mix.\u00a0 Here's what Wojtyla said about the Eucharist: When I think of the Eucharist, and look at my life as a priest, as a Bishop and as the Successor of Peter, I naturally recall the many times and places in which I was able to celebrate it. I remember the parish church of Niegowic, where I had my first pastoral assignment, the collegiate church of Saint Florian in Krakow, Wawel Cathedral, Saint Peter's Basilica and so many basilicas and churches in Rome and throughout the world. I have been able to celebrate Holy Mass in chapels built along mountain paths, on lakeshores and seacoasts; I have celebrated it on altars built in stadiums and in city squares... This varied scenario of celebrations of the Eucharist has given me a powerful experience of its universal and, so to speak, cosmic character. Yes, cosmic! Because even when it is celebrated on the humble altar of a country church, the Eucharist is always in some way celebrated on the altar of the world. It unites heaven and earth. It embraces and permeates all creation. (See Ecclesia Eucharistica, 2003, para. #8; Emphasis mine). The Eucharistic Christ \"permeates\" all creation? Here's what the Vatican Council of 1870 infallibly declared: CANON III. If anyone says that the substance or essence of God and that of all things are one and the same: let him be anathema. CANON IV.\u00a0 If anyone says that finite things, both corporal and spiritual, or at any rate, spiritual, emanated from the divine substance; or that the divine essence, by the manifestation and evolution of itself becomes all things or, finally, that God is a universal or indefinite being which by self determination establishes the totality of things distinct in genera, species and individuals: let him be anathema. This teaching of Wojtyla is definitely not the divinization taught by the Church Fathers. Now, here is his teaching in Dominum et Vivificantem (1986): The Incarnation of God the Son signifies the taking up into unity with God not only of human nature, but in this human nature, in a sense, of everything that is \"flesh\": the whole of humanity, the entire visible and material world. The Incarnation, then, also has a cosmic significance, a cosmic dimension. The \"first-born of all creation,\" becoming incarnate in the individual humanity of Christ, unites himself in some way with the entire reality of man, which is also \"flesh\" and in this reality with all \"flesh,\" with the whole of creation.\u00a0(para. #50; Emphasis mine).\u00a0 This is clearly Teilhardian \"cosmic pantheism.\" Can anyone think Wojtyla is teaching Christ is not really \"united with every man\" so as to effectuate Universal salvation? Does this sound like \"It is clear that the fashion in which the Son of God united Himself with every man is by taking on human nature\"?\u00a0 In his 1977 book, written by him in Italian,\u00a0Segno di Contraddizione,(\"Sign of Contradiction\") \"Cardinal\" Wojtyla states, \"Tutti gli uomini, fin dall'inizio del mondo e fino alla sua fine, sono stat redenti e giustificati da Cristo e dalla sua Croce.\"\u00a0 Translation: \"All men, from the beginning of the world and until its end, have been redeemed and justified by Christ and his Cross.\" (pg. 90) If we are justified we are in the state of sanctifying grace, and thereby saved if we die in that state. \"All men\" means \"all humans\" whether or not baptized and whether or not they are even in good faith. The German edition also contains this exact phrase. The English edition deletes the heretical words \"and justified.\" All three were published simultaneously and I have access to all three editions. Since Wojtyla wrote the original text of the Italian manuscript, and the German and English editions were put out by translators, Wojtyla penned the heresy. It is affirmed in German, and I must consider the English translation (pg. 87) to an error of the translators. Never was a correction put out by the Vatican or Wojtyla, who became \"pope\" one year later. Are we still to believe he's not teaching Universalism?\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In his speech at the first Interfaith Assisi abomination on October 27, 1986, Wojtyla said: Religious differences reveal themselves as pertaining to another order. If the order of unity is divine, the religious differences are a human doing and must be overcome in the process towards the realization of the grandiose design of unity which presides over creation. It is possible that men not be conscious of their radical unity of origin and of their insertion in the very same divine plan. But despite such divisions, they are included in the grand and single design of God in Jesus Christ, who united himself in a certain way with every man (Gaudium et Spes, 22) even if he is not conscious of it. Still think he's teaching that \"It is clear that the fashion in which the Son of God united Himself with every man is by taking on human nature\"?\u00a0 Mr. D? Anyone?\u00a0 Let me spell it out for you: All men belong to a pantheistic Christ who is united to each man, whether he knows it or not, by virtue of his Incarnation. That is rank heresy. Moreover, it cannot be defended by citing to the text of GS, because the pope is protected by the Holy Ghost from teaching error, and not just in ex cathedra declarations. So if Wojtyla is your pope, then GS teaches Universalism.\u00a0 As Pope St. Pius X teaches about Modernists:Though they express astonishment themselves, no one can justly be surprised that We number such men among the enemies of the Church, if, leaving out of consideration the internal disposition of soul, of which God alone is the judge, he is acquainted with their tenets, their manner of speech, their conduct.\u00a0(See Pascendi Dominici Gregis, para. #3; Emphasis mine). Heresy consists in dictis vel factis \u2014 not only in words, but also in \u201csigns, deeds, and the omission of deeds.\u201d (See theologian Merkelbach, Summa Theologiae Moralis, 1:746.). Not only does Wojtyla use the same language as heretics, but his actions belie his heresy as well. He believes that all religions are more or less good and lead to Heaven according to the damnable and heretical Vatican II ecclesiology whereby the Church of Christ \"subsists\" in false religions. That's why he:kissed the blasphemous and evil Koranparticipated in all forms of non-Catholic worship (Protestants, Jews, and Hindus, to name but three)said that Moslems and Catholics worship the same God in a speech to the Moslems in Paris, May 31, 1980And all of this was ratified, so to speak, by Bergoglio who openly and unapologetically stated, \"I believe in God - not in a Catholic God; there is no Catholic God. There is God, and I believe in Jesus Christ, his incarnation. Jesus is my teacher and my pastor, but God, the Father, Abba, is the light and the Creator. This is my Being.\" (See brainyquote.com/quotes/pope_francis_571226; Emphasis mine).\u00a0 Attempted Defense Against the Charge of the Deification of HumansGiven the foregoing, can anyone sincerely doubt that in para. #12, when GS teaches,\u00a0 According to the almost unanimous opinion of believers and unbelievers alike, all things on earth should be related to man as their center and crown, it is deifying Man, and in the heretical Teilhardian-pantheistic sense?\u00a0 Rather than address Mr. D's contention that What is made clear in paragraph 12 is that man is indeed the \u201ccenter and crown of all things on earth.\u201d Man is created in the image and likeness of God, which has a threefold meaning: (1) he is a rational being capable of knowing and loving, (2) he is a social being created as male and female, and (3) he has dominion over the earth, I will defer to an authoritative source for members of the Vatican II sect: Herr Ratzinger. Before he became \"pope\" he was head of the \"Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith (sic),\" the former Holy Office, and was charged with defending the \"faith\" from heresy. What did he say regarding GS? \u00a0If it is desirable to offer a diagnosis of the text [Gaudium et Spes] as a whole, we might say that (in conjunction with the texts on religious liberty and world religions) it is a revision of the Syllabus of Pius IX, a kind of countersyllabus. Harnack, as we know, interpreted the Syllabus of Pius IX as nothing less than a declaration of war against his generation.\u00a0 This is correct insofar as the Syllabus established a line of demarcation against the determining forces of the nineteenth century: against the scientific and political world view of liberalism.\u00a0 In the struggle against modernism this twofold delimitation was ratified and strengthened.\u00a0 Since then many things have changed.\u00a0 The new ecclesiastical policy of Pius XI produced a certain openness toward the liberal understanding of the state.\u00a0 In a quiet but persistent struggle, exegesis and Church history adopted more and more the postulates of liberal science, and liberalism, too, was obliged to undergo many significant changes in the great political upheavals of the twentieth century.\u00a0 As a result, the one-sidedness of the position adopted by the Church under Pius IX and Pius X in response to the situation created by the new phase of history inaugurated by the French Revolution was to a large extent, corrected via facti, especially in Central Europe, but there was still no statement of the relationship that would exist between the Church and the world that had come into existence after 1789.\u00a0 In fact, an attitude that was largely prerevolutionary continued to exist in countries with strong Catholic majorities.\u00a0 Hardly anyone today will deny that the Spanish and Italian Concordats strove to preserve too much of a view that no longer corresponded with the facts.\u00a0 Hardly anyone today will deny that, in the field of education and with respect to the historico-critical method in modern science, anachronisms existed that corresponded closely to this adherence to an obsolete Church-state relationship.\u00a0 Only a careful investigation of the different ways in which acceptance of the new era was accomplished in various parts of the Church could unravel the complicated network of causes that formed the background of the \"Pastoral Constitution\", and only thus can the dramatic history of its influence be brought to light. \u00a0 \u00a0Let us be content to say that the text serves as a countersyllabus and, as such, represents, on the part of the Church, an attempt at an official reconciliation with the new era inaugurated in 1789. (See \"Cardinal\" Joseph Ratzinger, Principles of Catholic Theology,\u00a0 [1987] pgs. 381-382; Emphasis mine).\u00a0 What was the \"new era\" of 1789? The French Revolution with its Masonic motto of \"Liberty, Equality, Fraternity.\" There is nothing wrong with the correct understanding of those terms, but they are perverted by what Pope Leo XIII called \"...the kingdom of Satan, in whose possession and control are all whosoever follow the fatal example of their leader and of our first parents, those who refuse to obey the divine and eternal law, and who have many aims of their own in contempt of God, and many aims also against God.\" Masonry exalts Man, degrades God and seeks to eliminate Him from the minds of all humans.\u00a0 Let's take GS #12 in context with the teaching of Ratzinger (never censured or condemned by Wojtyla) and see how it really is a \"counter-syllabus\" of Errors: On Equality: GS, Ch. II, para. 29: Nevertheless, with respect to the fundamental rights of the person, every type of discrimination, whether social or cultural, whether based on sex, race, color, social condition, language or religion, is to be overcome and eradicated as contrary to God's intent. (Emphasis mine) The True Religion cannot be given preference over false sects. That would be \"discrimination.\"\u00a0 On Liberty: GS, Ch. I, para. 21: Hence the Church protests against the distinction which some state authorities make between believers and unbelievers, with prejudice to the fundamental rights of the human person.(Emphasis mine).What \"fundamental rights of the person\" prevents the State from making distinctions between those who profess the Truth, and those who are partisans of error? On Fraternity: GS, Ch. V, para. 91: Drawn from the treasures of Church teaching, the proposals of this sacred synod look to the assistance of every man of our time, whether he believes in God, or does not explicitly recognize Him. If adopted, they will promote among men a sharper insight into their full destiny, and thereby lead them to fashion the world more to man's surpassing dignity, to search for a brotherhood which is universal and more deeply rooted, and to meet the urgencies of our ages with a gallant and unified effort born of love. (Emphasis mine) Atheists, agnostics, and members of the Church can \"fashion the world more to man's surpassing dignity\" and achieve \"universal brotherhood\" in which God is irrelevant at best. Pure Masonic poison.\u00a0 Man is indeed the center and crown as well as the \"measure of all things\" in this Masonic design. As \"Pope\" Benedict XVI, he also proved himself as a faithful disciple of Teilhard. He said: The role of the priesthood is to consecrate the world so that it may become a living host, a liturgy: so that the liturgy may not be something alongside the reality of the world, but that the world itself shall become a living host, a liturgy. This is also the great vision of Teilhard de Chardin: in the end we shall achieve a true cosmic liturgy, where the cosmos becomes a living host. And let us pray the Lord to help us become priests in this sense, to aid in the transformation of the world, in adoration of God, beginning with ourselves. That our lives may speak of God, that our lives may be a true liturgy, an announcement of God, a door through which the distant God may become the present God, and a true giving of ourselves to God. (See http://w2.vatican.va/content/benedict-xvi/en/homilies/2009/documents/hf_ben-xvi_hom_20090724_vespri-aosta.html; Emphasis mine). For those not familiar with the works of Teilhard, he believed in polygenism, which posits the idea that the human race had different origins, as opposed to a single couple; Adam and Eve. His heretical theory was roundly condemned in the brilliant encyclical Humani Generis of Pope Pius XII, which was drafted by the eminent Dominican theologian Fr. Reginald Garrigou-Lagrange. As the result of his evolutionism and polygenism, he denied not only the First Parents of the human race, but as a necessary consequence, he denied the dogma of Original Sin.\u00a0 Let's see how the True Church reacted to Teilhard de Chardin:1926, his Superior forbade him to teach1933, the Holy See ordered him to give up his subsequent post in Paris1939, the Holy See banned some of his writings1947, Rome also forbade him to write or teach on philosophical subjects1955, his Superiors forbade de Chardin to attend the International Congress on Paleontology. That same year, de Chardin died in New York on Easter Sunday Even under Roncalli (John XXIII), he was censured posthumously. On June 30, 1962, a Monitum (\"warning\") was given at Rome by the Holy Office: It is sufficiently clear that the above mentioned works abound in such ambiguities and indeed even serious errors, as to offend Catholic doctrine. For this reason, the most eminent and most reverend Fathers of the Holy Office exhort all Ordinaries as well as Superiors of Religious Institutes, rectors of seminaries and presidents of universities, effectively to protect the minds, particularly of the youth, against the dangers presented by the works of Teilhard de Chardin and his followers. Of course the Monitum of 1962 was a dead letter, which was never enforced, as Teilhard's works spread like wildfire in seminaries and Catholic Universities during the early 1960s.\u00a0 Here are some of the results of his ideas: 1. If there is no Original Sin, there is no need of a Redeemer. If there was no Adam, Christ could not be the Second Adam Who died to ransom us from sin. (Sin, in all forms, is downplayed or outright denied). He became Man to help us evolve towards \"godhood.\" 2. The Holy Sacrifice of the Mass is not the unbloody re-presentation throughout time of the Sacrificial death of Christ, since there was no need of it. (Mass becomes a \"celebration of the people\" who are \"evolving towards God\" and will become One).\u00a0 3. Since everything is evolving, there is no fixed and immutable dogmas or morality (One religion or set of morals is as good as another). 4. Eventually, everyone gets to enjoy happiness--there is no Hell for the wicked (Hell is considered \"negative\" and outdated theology). 5. In his pantheistic idea, not only humanity, but all of nature is evolving. Hence, there should be reverence for the Earth; Teilhard will sometimes describe Earth as an \"altar\" upon which humanity and nature are \"transubstantiated.\" Given that both Masonry and Teilhard deify Man (and not in the orthodox sense of the Church Fathers), and given that Ratzinger was (a) a disciple of Teilhard and (b) interpreted GS as a \"counter-syllabus\" and \"an official reconciliation with the new era inaugurated in 1789\"--are we to suppose GS #12 is notthe heretical deification of Man? Attempted Defense Against the Charge of Falsifying Christ's WordsFrom GS para. #24: This is why the first and greatest commandment is love of God and of neighbor.I cited the Gospel of St. Mark : And there came one of the scribes that had heard them reasoning together, and seeing that he had answered them well, asked him which was the first commandment of all. And Jesus answered him: The first commandment of all is, Hear, O Israel: the Lord thy God is one God. And thou shalt love the Lord thy God, with thy whole heart, and with thy whole soul, and with thy whole mind, and with thy whole strength. This is the first commandment. \u00a0And the second is like to it: Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself. There is no other commandment greater than these. (St. Mark 12:28-31; Emphasis mine). The first and greatest Commandment is therefore love of God, and the second is love of neighbor as yourself. This is what Christ said and what the Church always taught until Vatican II.\u00a0 To place these two Commandments on equal footing is to equate God and Man, or to (once more) deify humans. Mr. D counters that\u00a0One may also notice that GS has presented the twofold commandment in much the same way as [the Gospel of St.] Luke, presenting it as one commandment, though with love of God before love of neighbor. If this were an orthodox document, like those of Pope Pius XII, one could very well give it such a favorable interpretation. Yet, since it has been decreed a \"counter-syllabus\" by Herr Ratzinger and that interpretation given no censure from Wojtyla, it is not a stretch of the imagination that it was to further the heretical deification of Man, and not an imitation of the wording from St. Luke. Attempted Defense Against the Charge of Giving False Principles Re: Marriage and Women My two charges against GS in this regard were that it inverts the primary and secondary ends of Matrimony and promotes a false feminism. GS #48 it states\u00a0\u00a0By their very nature, the institution of matrimony itself and conjugal love are ordained for the procreation and education of children, and find in them their ultimate crown.\u00a0 Mr. D responds that\u00a0In this case we are not speaking of children as the culmination or crowning achievement of marriage, but a crown or garland placed upon the head of the spouses. Children are the glory of the parents, a glory which can only be attained through the conjugal love of the spouses. In 1968 when Montini (\"Pope\" Paul VI) published Humanae Vitae, entire episcopates immediately refused this condemnation, saying spouses needed \u201ca physical expression of their love.\u201d (See Pastoral Letter of the Bishops of France, 11/8/1968). These episcopates did not hesitate to use GS #51 as the basis of their dissent because it made the two ends of marriage equal. According to Vatican II sect theologian Joseph Selling, a professor of Moral Theology, states\u00a0In Paragraph 6 of Humanae Vitae, Paul VI rejected the findings of his commission on the grounds that \"certain criteria of solutions had emerged which departed from the moral teaching on marriage proposed with constant firmness by the teaching authority of the Church.\" As a professor of moral theology, I have spent upward of four decades searching for that \"constant teaching,\" only to find that, like many other moral teachings of the church, such as those about usury, slavery, and religious freedom, it has been in a continuous state of evolution. [Teilhard?Also, there was no substantial change in Church teaching in any of those subjects pre-Vatican II.] Although Gaudium et Spes did not directly address the question of regulating fertility it did:Reduce the status of the teaching on the ends of marriage to a historical reference;Put forth a theological understanding of the sacrament of marriage based on the model of \"covenant\" (in contrast to the notion of a \"contract\" in canon law);Present its understanding of marriage to be based upon conjugal love (#49) and separately developed its understanding of the fruitfulness of marriage along the lines of responsible parenthood (#50);Clearly state (#51) that whatever approach would be used to deal with the regulation of fertility needed to be based not upon a biological norm or natural law, but rather upon an understanding of the \"human person integrally and adequately considered\" (Expensio Modorum, 104).(See\u00a0https://www.ncronline.org/news/opinion/overwriting-tradition-humanae-vitae-replaced-real-church-teaching; Emphasis mine). This idea is being taught in Moral Theology courses and without censure or condemnation. Mr. D's own sect's theologians dispute his understanding. As to the status of women, I stated\u00a0GS para. #12 teaches, But God did not create man as a solitary, for from the beginning \"male and female he created them\" (Gen. 1:27). This statement is, once more, deceiving. God did create man and woman, but the citation to Genesis leaves out Genesis 2:18, 23: \"And the Lord God said: It is not good for a man to be alone: let us make him a help like unto himself...And Adam said: This now is bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh; she shall be called woman, because she was taken out of man.\" (Emphasis mine). GS gives the false idea that man and woman were created at the same time, thereby implying strict equality. Mr. D takes umbrage with what he posits as my analysis of women being indirectly in the image of God while men are directly in God's image. His problem is not from me but from my cited source: theologian Wahl, The Exclusion of Women from Holy Orders, [1959], pgs. 45-55 which is there for all to read and which he conveniently omits in his argument. So if he thinks he understands St. Bonaventure and Church teaching better than an approved pre-Vatican II theologian, I'll simply dismiss it as hubris.\u00a0 A Possible Vatican II Sect Objection Anticipated and RefutedOne common objection Vatican II sect apologists will use is the fallacious Appeal to Ambiguity, as I like to call it. It basically runs like this: \"GS [or any other Vatican II sect document] is capable of an orthodox interpretation. John Paul II didn't specifically say that all man are united to Christ forever in the Teilhardian manner. It could mean we are united to Christ by His human nature. The deification could be interpreted to be like the Church Fathers. GS is capable of orthodox interpretations so we must assume it to be so and read it as such.\"\u00a0 Even if, ad arguendo, GS was capable of an orthodox interpretation, the very fact that it is open to a heretical understanding is enough for it to stand condemned. The Church cannot (and does not) teach ambiguously in expressing theological truths. Any deliberate ambiguity must be interpreted against the orthodoxy of the one teaching ambiguously. Propositions that are ambiguous or admit of interpretations that are either orthodox or heterodox are deemed \"heretical by defect.\" This is also the case with propositions that are true, but are calculated to omit pertinent truths or terms they ought to include. The following proposition of the Jansenist Pseudo-Synod of Pistoia was condemned: After the consecration, Christ is truly, really and substantially present beneath the appearances (of bread and wine), and the whole substance of bread and wine has ceased to exist, leaving only the appearances. In 1794, Pope Pius VI condemned that proposition in the Apostolic Constitution Auctorem Fidei because it entirely omits to make any mention of transubstantiation or the conversion of the entire substance of the bread into the Body, and the whole substance of the wine into the Blood, which the Council of Trent defined as an article of Faith...insofar as, through an unauthorized and suspicious omission of this kind, attention is drawn away both from an article of Faith and from a word consecrated by the Church to safeguard the profession of that article against heresies, and tends, therefore, to result in its being forgotten as if it were merely a scholastic question.  \u00a0ConclusionAaron Debusschere tells us that\u00a0The easiest way to clarify the meaning of a text is to take it in context. In the case of Gaudium et Spes, or any Magisterial text, this means reading the sentence in the context of the whole paragraph, the whole chapter, the whole document, and even the whole body of documents...determining whether the meaning of the given text is in continuity with the Scriptures or the Tradition of the Church is always easier when one actually looks at the Scriptures and Tradition as a whole. Actually, the best and only authoritative way to determine the meaning of a Magisterial text is to simply have the Vicar of Christ, Roman Congregations, and the approved theologians tell it to you. What good is having a Teaching Authority (Magisterium) that can't teach?\u00a0 Moreover, when we had a real pope and real approved theologians, they wrote and spoke in the clear language of Scholasticism/Neo-Scholasticism. Now we are subjected to gobbledygook wherein there is \"cosmic significance,\" a \"cosmic dimension,\"\u00a0 whereby the Eucharistic Christ \"permeates all Creation\" and \"celebrated on the altar of the world.\"\u00a0 The real mystery is trying to make heads or tails of what any of this verbiage means--phrases you will never find pre-Vatican II. I have demonstrated: Both the teaching of the approved theologians and Church history prove that an extended vacancy of the Holy See is in no way incompatible with the Indefectibility of the Church and the promises of ChristA member of the Vatican II sect recognizes Roncalli through Bergoglio as true Vicars of Christ. As such, they must give assent to the authoritative pronouncements they make on matters of Catholic doctrineWojtyla (John Paul II) is an ecumenist and disciple of heretics. It is proven in his words and deeds. He has authoritatively interpreted GS as teaching each human is united with Christ so as to preclude damnation. This goes hand in glove with his equally heretical declaration that by the Cross all men, from the beginning of the world, are both redeemed and justified\u00a0Ratzinger is also an ecumenist heretic. He called GS a \"counter-syllabus\" and \"an official reconciliation with the new era inaugurated in 1789\" Masonry seeks the deification of humanity in a way contrary to all Church teachingVatican II sect \"bishops\" and \"theologians\" have used GS as proof that the primary and secondary ends of marriage are either inverted or equal according to its text and have used it to justify artificial contraceptionPre-Vatican II theologians taught that women are indirectly in the image of God while men are directly in God's image, which is one reason advanced as to why women cannot be validly ordained as priests The manifest weight of the credible evidence proves Aaron Debusschere's attempted refutation of my arguments to be without merit. Moreover, he must submit to his pope and the interpretations/clarifications he gives. That Vatican II makes some orthodox and orthodox sounding statements is meaningless considering Protestant sects do the same, but that doesn't make a Lutheran document \"Catholic.\" Mr. D ends his post by claiming that I \"threw GS, Vatican II, and the Magisterium of the last sixty years out the window, and the fullness of the Truth flew out with them.\"\u00a0 Actually, it is Aaron Debusschere who fails to submit to the teachings of his popes and tries to substitute his own interpretation of GS. It is you who needs to throw out all Church teaching from St. Peter to Pope Pius XII in order to evolve into the pneumatosphere where all will be united to Christ in some cosmic fashion. Welcome to the Vatican II sect, Mr. Debusschere. I hope you will not stay long.",

                "text": "Guest Post and Meet an Author\u00a0 \nCan you, for those who don\u2019t know you already, tell something about yourself and how you became an author? \nI went to a tiny college in Hartford, Connecticut.\u00a0 In my sophomore year, I joined a fraternity.\u00a0 In my senior year, there was a fraternity brother of mine named Jason Morfoot who told me this story about a group of guys who wrote poetry and literature all the time, smoked a lot of pot, dropped a lot of acid, and drove around in a psychedelic-painted bus with the Grateful Dead. \nOnce I heard this story, I asked Jason to tell it to me over and over again, probably to his chagrin.\u00a0 I was so charmed by what the Beats did way back when that I said to myself, \u2018Gee, maybe this writing thing is for me.\u2019\u00a0 Of course, it never turned out the way it turned out for them, but I never would have gone into writing had Jason not told me about the Beat Generation.\u00a0 At the time, it sounded like they lived a fairy-tale life.\u00a0 Perhaps they did. \nWhere were you born/grew up at? \nI was born in Lahore, Pakistan in 1971.\u00a0 I immigrated to the United States when I was just a newborn.\u00a0 My family first moved to Buffalo, New York, and over the years, we found ourselves in New York City by the mid-1970s.\u00a0 Back then, New York City was in dire straits \u2013 high crime, intense poverty, drugs, etc.\u00a0 I still can\u2019t believe how my mother got through it all, living in the toughest neighborhood in the city at the time, which was then known as Alphabet City, or what is currently known as the Lower East Side.\u00a0 God must have been with her the entire time.\u00a0 I am really amazed at how she persevered. She was incredible woman, even though our relationship was not. \nWhat do you do to unwind and relax? \nI like listening to the radio a lot.\u00a0 Usually, NPR, or Classic Rock and Roll. \nWhat inspired you to write this book? \nInterestingly enough, these stories were somehow stored on my computer for several years before I accidently found them in a hidden file on my hard drive.\u00a0 I discovered nearly ninety short stories that I forgotten I had ever written.\u00a0 It turns out that nearly seven or eight years ago, the poet, John Allen of Albany, New York, had asked me to submit stories for his website, The New Surrealist Institute, which is now defunct.\u00a0 This site had really been thriving, and a core group of authors had submitted avidly to it.\u00a0 It was also quite popular with many readers.\u00a0 When the website went offline, I had simply forgotten about the stories.\u00a0 When I found them, I just knew I had to compile them into a book. \nI wouldn\u2019t say that anything in particular inspired me to write these stories, though.\u00a0 The ideas came to me out of nowhere, which is why it took a lot of effort to construct them.\u00a0 Some of the political stories were inspired by the 2016 elections, for instance.\u00a0 There\u2019s a science fiction story that is more a personal response to my past relationships with friends who have now grown up to do amazing things with their lives.\u00a0 A couple stories are tributes to old friends of mine who had passed on: a painter friend of mine who had committed suicide in the 1990s and also a Black-American bluegrass musician who had recently passed away a couple of years ago.\u00a0 But I can\u2019t say exactly how I got the ideas for them, which is strange.\u00a0 They are very diverse and, I hope, fun to read. \nWhat can we expect from you in the future? \nRight now, I am working on a book about September 11, 2001, when the Word Trade Center in New York was hit by a terrorist attack.\u00a0 I haven\u2019t been working on the project consistently as of late, though, but I hope to have it done in a couple of years.\u00a0 Sometimes, life gets in the way of writing every day, which is something I made sure to do.\u00a0 But I really do want the September 11th book to be my finest publication, so it is always on my mind, and when I am working on it, I am working really hard. \nWho designed your book covers? \nI have to do everything on the cheap, as I have self-published for a long time.\u00a0 I usually find ready-made covers on the web, purchase them, and use them for my book covers.\u00a0 I use a site called www.selfpubbookcovers.com.\u00a0 There\u2019s a guy named Rob there who runs the show, and he has always been very responsive and helpful.\u00a0 He has hundreds of covers to choose from.\u00a0 Hiring designers for the job is just way too expensive for me.\u00a0 Ready-made covers from great designers are a great way to package my books. \nAnything specific you want to tell your readers? \nNever give up!\u00a0 Never give up!\u00a0 Never give up! \nHow long have you been writing? \nI have been a professional writer for nearly 30 years without much success.\u00a0 While I have published 18 books, it seems that it is hard to attract the public to read them.\u00a0 I am definitely not able to make a living off of any of these books.\u00a0 Instead, I have a fixed income every month from a variety of sources, including Social Security Disability, that has sustained me for all of these years.\u00a0 While I am very happy to see all of my peers succeed and do very well in life, it has been equally as difficult to remain within the same income bracket for so long.\u00a0 But then again, if you are concerned about the money, writing is definitely not the right career path to choose, or so is my experience. \nLately, I have been taking it easier.\u00a0 I hope to continue writing for the rest of my years, but I do admit that I am a bit tired of always being broke and pinching pennies all the time.\u00a0 That is the hard part.\u00a0 But somehow, I have made it through, and my books are all out there, should anyone find them. \nWhat kind of research do you do before you begin writing a book? \nI invest a lot in the research process.\u00a0 After a general story idea comes to mind, I refine that idea into a plot outline.\u00a0 Once that is done, I target those parts of the plot that I know nothing of.\u00a0 \nFor instance, I wrote a book about football.\u00a0 While I had known about football from playing it in my youth, I needed to investigate how professional players practice, not generally, but specifically.\u00a0 So, with that example in mind, I had to go to the library, or surf the internet, to find books that detailed the drills that professional coaches used in their practices.\u00a0 I took this information and then put them on notecards.\u00a0 Then, I added this information to the plot outline and created a chapter-by-chapter outline with the research included in every respective chapter.\u00a0 That\u2019s how it has worked for me thus far. \nAlso, I find it extremely important to include a bibliography at the back of the book, should I use research.\u00a0 That way, the writing is based not only on my imagination, but also cold, hard facts.\u00a0 One should always cite one\u2019s sources anyway.\u00a0 Plus, I have found it really fun doing the research.\u00a0 It\u2019s incredible how much I have learned about a variety of subjects over the years.\u00a0 When writing historical fiction especially, research is always key. \nWhat do you think about the current publishing market?  \nNot much.\u00a0 But then again, I haven\u2019t read much of what is out there. \nPen or type writer or computer? \nI usually hand-write a manuscript, revise it on paper, and then I type it into the computer, constantly revising it. I then print out the manuscript and revise it again.\u00a0 But I usually do this chapter-by-chapter, not the entire manuscript at once.\u00a0 I find it easier to break it down into manageable parts. \nI used to hand-write it and then use a typewriter, but luckily for everyone, the personal computer came along. \nAdvice they would give new authors? \nDefinitely do not put all of your eggs in the one basket of writing.\u00a0 If you are going to write or edit for a job, or work as a journalist for a decent salary, that\u2019s fine.\u00a0 But please do not make the same mistake I had made by banking it all on writing fiction novels at an early age.\u00a0 Even though I have developed as a writer through hardship, I don\u2019t think it was really all that worth it.\u00a0 \nIf I had to do it all over again, I would have chosen a career with a good salary, so that I could have afforded a good car, attracted a nice girlfriend, afforded a simple house, and did what most of my peers have done, or at least developed how most people are portrayed in the media of today.\u00a0 I wouldn\u2019t have had such a cavalier \u2018all or none\u2019 attitude about a becoming a writer.\u00a0 \nBetting it all on the one hand and winning at it is the stuff of dreams and fantasy and not reality.\u00a0 I am definitely not saying that it won\u2019t happen, though, because a new author definitely could hit the big time with a book or a number of books.\u00a0 But if you find yourself broke and on the street in the freezing cold, as I have witnessed in every city I have lived in, you should really stop and reassess where you are heading.\u00a0 In my opinion, it is not possible to write under conditions of abject poverty for too long.\u00a0 Better to get a roof over your head before writing that next line. \n \n\n\n \n\n \n \n\nThe Odd and the Strange:\nA Collection of Very Short Fiction\nby Harvey Havel\nGenre: Horror, Sci-Fi, Surrealist, Fabulist\n \n\n \nA Collection of Very Short Fiction from a variety of genres, including but not limited to horror, science fiction, politics, and the surreal. These celebrated very short stories have been collected over a number of years and have been published in a variety of online e-zines and posted on various websites.\n \n \nTHE ODD AND THE STRANGE by Harvey Havel is a collection of urban tales that toe the line of reality.\nThe subtitle of Harvey Havel\u2019s THE ODD AND THE STRANGE is A Collection of Very Short Fiction. A better one would be A Very Long Book of Normal-Sized Short Fiction. There are 89 stories in all, most 5-10 pages long (though a few stretch to nearly twenty), with unassuming titles like \u201cVisitation,\u201d \u201cGirlfriend,\u201d and \u201cDaughter.\u201d Though set in the real world, the stories tease reality with nameless characters\u2013the candidate, the doctor, the Big Man\u2013and fantastical occurrences, similar to the parables of Jorge Luis Borges (Argentine short-story writer, essayist, poet and translator, and a key figure in Spanish language literature).\nBeing a librarian, I was eager to read the story \u201cThe Librarian.\u201d A young male librarian\u2013unnamed, naturally\u2013looks into a mirror in his office and sees not his reflection but a woman with \u201cwalnut hair luxuriously long and her skin as supple as a young girl\u2019s.\u201d He has seen her many times, and though the two cannot touch, they can talk. What do they talk about? The books he steals from the library and passes into the mirror for her to read. Eventually, his boss confronts the librarian over the missing books only to be told that the latter he gave them to his mirror-world girlfriend. To prove this claim, the librarian tries to summon the woman, and when she doesn\u2019t appear, the librarian smashes the mirror. You can imagine the rest.\nSome stories are less Borges and more Stephen Crane (author of The Red Badge of Courage): bleak, violent. Like \u201cLightning Love,\u201d narrated by a wife whose husband changes into . . . something (the twist at the end is brilliant). Others are political fables, like \u201cSanta Claus and Madam Secretary,\u201d which makes Havel\u2019s proclivities as clear as the image on a 98-inch TV. His style can be clunky\u2013one woman\u2019s breasts are described as \u201cshaped like a queen\u2019s\u201d\u2013and some endings are telegraphed. A few stories, like \u201cSex Toy,\u201d are more like story fragments. Yet THE ODD AND THE STRANGE is quite an accomplishment: unusual, provocative, and honest.\nMixing the fabulism of Jorge Luis Borges with the bleakness of Stephen Crane, the tales contained in Harvey Havel\u2019s THE ODD AND THE STRANGE draw the reader into a world they won\u2019t soon forget.\n~Anthony Aycock for IndieReader\n \n \n**Get this book at 50% off at Smashwords and check out Harvey\u2019s other books \n\u2013 a lot of them are FREE or on sale at Smashwords too!**\n \n \nAdd to Goodreads\nAmazon * Apple * B&N * Google * Kobo * Smashwords\n \n \n\n\nHarvey Havel is a short-story writer and novelist.\nHis first novel, Noble McCloud, A Novel, was published in November of 1999.

What was once just a tool to place calls from outside the home or office has become an essential Swiss Army knife of tech that fits hand in hand with our work lives, education, and countless daily tasks. Thanks in part to the wide-ranging capacity of apps these days, even the latest smartphone won't come out of the box at its full potential. You can largely thank the millions of apps available on marketplaces like the Google Play Store for the powerful device you hold in your hand.   With the sheer number of available apps for your Android device, the choices can be overwhelming. With this guide, we've distilled a mammoth assortment of apps down to 100 of the very best. We've sorted them into neat categories, from core apps to lesser-known selections \u2014 we believe there is something for everyone.   If you're an iPhone loyalist, then check out our list of the best iOS apps instead, and if you're more into gaming, check out our list of the best Android games.     Android essentials  Facebook                                   Can two billion people be wrong? The biggest social network on the planet has a decent official app. Keep up with your friends and family, jump into instant chats, and stay informed with push notifications. Best of all, Facebook isn't just a place to share content stolen from Reddit and Twitter, as the world's biggest social media site has also pushed out into sections for dating, shopping, and videos. Pair it with Messenger for the ultimate double-act.   Google Play   YouTube                                   Alright, you probably have YouTube already \u2014 but that doesn't make it any less an essential. YouTube's mobile app is sleek and intuitive, bringing the entirety of the video-sharing site to the palm of your hand. For those subscribed to YouTube Premium, you'll have access to all the premium content, as well as special features like audio playback while the screen is off.   Google Play   Twitter  Story continues                                    Sometimes unfairly viewed as the lesser version of Facebook, Twitter is the place where everything seems to happen instantly. Birthplace of the now now-ubiquitous internet facet, the hashtag, Twitter is the best place to be if you like to be on top of the latest breaking news as it happens. Follow your favorite content creators, actors, or crazes, and follow all the news, impressions, and opinions as they roll in.   Google Play   Google Home                                   If you're spending more time at home than usual, you might finally have the time to get to that connected-home project you always swore you'd do. If you are the proud home owner of a Google Home device, then you already know the ins and outs of a digital assistant. The Google Home app takes this one step further, allowing you to control a plethora of connected smart home devices. It also serves as a command central for any native Google connected device and your Google connected accounts, like maps, contacts, calendars, and more.   Google Play   Movies and videos  Netflix             Netflix isn't just one of the best video-streaming services; it's the video-streaming service. There's a huge selection of Netflix movies and TV shows for subscribers and the performance is silky smooth. It's not just restricted to old favorites either, as Netflix has produced a huge amount of excellent exclusive content \u2014 though if you're anything like us, you'll just put The Office on again. This is as entertained as you can get from just $9 a month, or $16 a month if you want access to 4K content.   Google Play   Disney+                                   If you're looking for anything from Disney, Star Wars, Marvel, or the musical sensation Hamilton, the only place to go is Disney+. The app allows you to stream everything from the latest Avengers blockbuster to those weird Disney Channel programs you used to watch back when you were a teenager. With the COVID-19 pandemic slowing down the reopening of theaters across the globe, Disney is even using Disney+ for major blockbusters like Mulan. There's a seven-day free trial, and it'll cost you $7 a month after that \u2014 though you can pay $70 for a year in advance to save $14.   Google Play   Hulu             HuluHulu's the place to go if you want to see the latest episodes of thousands of shows or movies on Hulu, or catch up on some older classic movies. Running shows are updated as they air, while you can often also catch live sport on here too. Hulu offers various subscription models, including one that opens up the entire streaming library for $6 a month, and another that removes midstream ads for $12 a month. If you're looking to cut the cord, Hulu also offers live TV with DVR starting at $61 a month, but be aware it costs a little more if you want to fast-forward through commercials on recorded episodes.   Google Play   Amazon Prime Video                                   These days, it seems all the content in the world isn't enough to satiate those of us who suddenly find ourselves with far more time to watch a new show or movie at home. Amazon Prime offers a number of fantastic originals on its streaming platform, which also serves as a great home base for its extensive catalog. Prime Video also allows you to add all your favorite subscription channels to your feed. We've also found the best movies on Amazon prime to start watching today if you're interested.   Google Play   HBO Max                                   The streaming race continues to heat up, and AT&T wasn't about to let WarnerMedia go without a fight. HBO Max launched in the summer of 2020 and brings with it all the HBO content audiences are already familiar with, with the added benefit of original content produced exclusively for the streaming platform. Like other streaming giants, HBO has shelled out some serious cash to acquire content for its platform, like Doctor Who and Friends.   Google Play   Music and audio  Spotify             Spotify is probably the first name that springs to mind when you think about music apps and for good reason as it's one of the best streaming services out there. There's a massive selection of music on offer, from the latest huge releases to up and coming acts. Spotify also now offers video support for some of the best podcasts on their platform. There's a free version if you want to try it out, but if you want ad-free listening, to download music, play any song, and have unlimited skips, then you'll need to subscribe for $10 a month, though Spotify does offer a generous three-month free trial. Spotify also offers a family household plan for $15 a month, a student account at the reduced cost of $5 a month, and a \"Duo\" account covering 2 people in the same household for $13 a month.   Google Play   Soundcloud                                   If you're looking for an all-you-can-eat buffet of sound with no ads and no subscription fees, you've found it. You can discover new music and stream it from the cloud, but this is no Spotify replacement \u2014 most of the music on Soundcloud is from relatively unknown artists, and if you're not able to find it on Spotify, you can probably find it here. Listening is free, with the pro versions of SoundCloud mostly being for the artists themselves. It's not just about music, though, as you'll find a lot of podcasts on here too. A great complement to another music streaming service.   Google Play   Podcast Addict             best android apps podcast addict android2           best android apps podcast addict android3           best android apps podcast addict android1If you find yourself listening to more podcasts these days, you're not alone. Recently, it seems every friend and co-worker has a new favorite podcast, as we've all been bitten by the podcast bug. Podcast Addict is an absolute powerhouse for podcast fans, with an extensive library to choose from featuring over 1 million podcasts and over 35 million episodes. Though there are paid options with extra features, the core app is free. For the sheer amount of content and decent features, this app is a fantastic value.   Google Play   Google Play Music                                   Google's official streaming service is a worthy competitor to Spotify. Not only does the app provide a vast library of content, but it also allows users to upload up to 50,000 of their own songs for online storage. So if you've got a collection of MP3s from before the days when streaming was the normal way to consume music, upload them to Google Play Music and stream them from any of your mobile devices. Be warned though, it's not long for this world.   Google Play   Apple Music                                   If you use a Mac or iPad on top of your Android phone, you may be better served with Apple Music over Spotify. Apple Music offers access to Apple's massive library of music, as well as Apple's Beats 1 radio station, which plays both current hits and up-and-coming music. The celebrity DJs and exclusive album streams are a plus, but you'll have to subscribe before you can listen. There's no free tier, so you'll have to pony up $10 a month.   Google Play   News  The New York Times                                   One of America's most hallowed publications also has one of the best news apps. The New York Times app arranges the publication's content in a clean format and allows users to customize their newsfeed, and it comes with breaking news alerts to bring you the biggest news as it happens. If you're looking for one of the best news apps out there, this is it.   Google Play   Vice News             If you prefer journalism that leans toward gonzo, Vice offers its robust library of written and video content in an app that is elegant and easy to navigate. The app includes estimated reading times, so users with a time-crunch can prioritize articles to suit their schedules.   Google Play   NPR News                                   The official app of National Public Radio provides a steady stream of straightforward reporting in both print and audio. Users can not only listen to news reports but also various programs such as All Things Considered and Radiolab.   Google Play   AP News             best android apps ap news android2           best android apps ap news android3           best android apps ap news android1The Associated Press has a long-standing reputation for being one of the least-editorialized news sources around, as well as being consistently on the cutting edge of breaking news. So, if you're looking for your daily dose of news without the added fluff, then AP News on Android is the perfect accompaniment to your morning coffee. AP's self-ascribed description says it best \u2014 it's \"where the news gets its news.\"   Google Play   Google News                                   Though it may seem like a no-brainer, the Google News app is a worthwhile recommendation, thanks to its smart curation and diverse news feed. Google News puts together news from sources all over the world, which makes it likely that you'll find your favorite news source from back home within its catalog.   Google Play   Nwsty                                   Ever feel like there's just too much news to keep up with? Nwsty might well be the app for you. It's aimed at those who don't often read the news, and makes it easy to keep up with the daily headlines without spending too much time on them. Each day, you get six to 10 headlines in your digest that you can quickly and easily read in a matter of only a few minutes.   Google Play   Sports  Strafe Esports                                   If your favorite sports league isn't in season or back on the air quite yet, then let yourself go down the rabbit hole of e-sports. The Strafe app covers all the most popular leagues and teams from League of Legends to Counter-Strike and everything in between. You can keep up with all the latest tournaments while reading all the most detailed statistics.   Google Play   theScore                                   Whatever gets you excited, from NASCAR to the NFL, theScore will have you dancing in victory or crying in your beer. It brings you all the latest touchdowns, goals, and home runs as they happen.   Google Play   ESPN                                   Having the official ESPN app installed is a no-brainer for any die-hard sports fan, especially if you have ESPN+. You can quickly get the latest news on your favorite teams and leagues, including MLB, NFL, NCAA, MLS, NHL, and more.   Google Play   CBS Sports                                   Not only does the CBS Sports app have the latest news, standings, and scores for all major league sports, you can also watch live games and events like NCAA basketball and the PGA Tour, as well as CBS Sports original programming, like Fantasy Football Today.   Google Play   Social media  Tiktok                        how to use tiktok 2 best ios apps           Essentially Vine for a new generation, TikTok is the home of short videos that are amusing, meme-laden, and just generally fit for a certain demographic. It says it's there for raw, 15-second storytelling \u2014 but we know most people are there for the memes and song mimers. It's fun, showcases some real creativity, and while it might not be for everyone, it is blowing up right now, and garnering attention all over the world. However, the future of TikTok is murkier than ever as we await the likely sale of the company's U.S. operations to an American company, and Instagram turns up the heat with its competitor product, Reels. We've also found TikTok alternatives for those looking for options.   Google Play   Instagram                                   Instagram is ubiquitous in photography now, so you might as well have it on your phone. Owned by Facebook, the social network centered on photos offers great filters and connectivity with others. Instagram has also recently launched a TikTok competitor called Reels.   Google Play   Houseparty                                   Houseparty couldn't possibly be more relevant for 2020. This app allows you to stay in touch with friends by jumping in and out of \"always-on\" group hangouts. There's also a great selection of games you can play while hanging out which are always being updated and improved. Perfect for hanging out with friends and family if you can't hang out in person. Houseparty is a fun way to interact with friends, but you may want to consider turning location data off when using the app.   Google Play   Messaging  Skype                                   The original VOIP service is now owned by Microsoft and boasts more than 250 million users. Free international voice and video calls via your data or Wi-Fi connection are hard to pass up.   Google Play   Messenger & Messenger Kids                                   Facebook's best feature is arguably its built-in messaging. Facebook now offers its messenger service as a stand-alone app, enabling you to chat with your Facebook friends and anyone in your contacts with the app installed \u2014 without having to be signed into Facebook or even have Facebook installed on your phone at all.   If you're a parent, then Messenger Kids is a must-download on your child's phone. Messenger Kids might seem like it's built for kids, but it's really built for parents. With the app, parents have control over their kids' contact list, and messages can't be deleted \u2014 meaning that parents can check in to take a look whenever they want. Of course, there are some pretty sweet features for kids, like kid-appropriate stickers, GIFs, emojis, and so on.   Messenger Messenger Kids   WhatsApp                                   The Google Play Store has no shortage of messaging apps, but WhatsApp's secure end-to-end encryption and feature-rich interface mark it as one of the best. This cross-platform app lets you send and receive messages, pictures, audio notes, and video messages for completely free. A must-have for messaging addicts, even if the U.S. hasn't fully embraced it yet.   Google Play   Zoom Cloud Meetings                                   Zoom has emerged as a darling of the work-from-home and stay-at-home lifestyle, and rightfully so.

                "text": "Louella Desiderio (The Philippine Star) \u2013 January 16, 2021 \u2013 12:00am \n\n\n\nMANILA, Philippines \u2014 Over 50 business groups have joined the call for the immediate enactment into law of the Corporate Recovery and Tax Incentives for Enterprises (CREATE) bill, noting every day of delay puts the country at risk of losing more jobs and investments amid the COVID-19 pandemic. \nThe CREATE bill seeks to reduce the corporate income tax (CIT) rate and introduce changes in the grant of incentives to help businesses reeling from the impact of the pandemic. \nThe groups consist of ACI Philippines, Anvil Business Club, Ateneo Law Alumni Association Inc., Bankers Association of the Philippines, Cebu Business Club, Cebu Leads Foundation, Chamber of Thrift Banks, Chinese Filipino Business Club Inc., CIBI Foundation Inc., Federation of Filipino \u2013 Chinese Chambers of Commerce and Industry Inc., Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce Philippines Inc., Financial Executives Institute of the Philippines, Fintech Philippines Association, FinTech Alliance Philippines, Foundation for Economic Freedom, French Chamber of Commerce and Industry in the Philippines, Fund Managers Association of the Philippines, Guild of Real Estate Professionals, Hotel and Restaurant Association of the Philippines, Institute for Solidarity in Asia Inc., Institute of Corporate Directors, Integrated Bar of the Philippines, Intellectual Property Association of the Philippines, Investment House Association of the Philippines, Information Technology and Business Process Association of the Philippines, Licensing Executives Society Philippines, Makati Business Club, Management Association of the Philippines, Money Market Association of the Philippines, National Real Estate Association Inc., Nordic Chamber of Commerce of the Philippines Inc., Organization of Socialized Housing Developers of the Philippines, Philippine Association of Securities Brokers and Dealers Inc., Philippine Bar Association, Philippine Center for Entrepreneurship (Go Negosyo), Philippine Council of Associations and Association Executives, Philippine Franchise Association, Philippine Hotel Owners Association Inc., Philippine Institute of Certified Public Accountants, Philippine Life Insurance Association, Philippine Retailers Association, Philippine Women\u2019s Economic Network, Procurement and Supply Institute of Asia, Rural Bankers Association of the Philippines, Shareholders\u2019 Association of the Philippines, Spanish Chamber of Commerce in the Philippines, Subdivision and Housing Developers Association, Tax Management Association of the Philippines, Trust Officers Association of the Philippines, University of the Philippines School of Economics Alumni Association and the Women\u2019s Business Council Philippines. \nThe House of Representatives and Senate are reconciling provisions of the CREATE bill before endorsing it to the President for approval. \n\u201cCREATE is a historic economic reform, one of the largest in decades. As a stimulus package, CREATE will be a boost to market confidence, providing instant relief to businesses suffering from business reverses due to the COVID-19 pandemic,\u201d the groups said. \nThe groups said they support the quick cut in CIT under the bill. \nFor small and medium enterprises earning net taxable income not exceeding P5 million, the CIT would be brought down to 20 percent from 30 percent. \nFor corporations, the CIT rate would be trimmed to 25 percent from 30 percent. \nApart from bringing the\u00a0 CIT rate closer to the 21.65 percent average in Southeast Asia, the reduction would also help firms have resources to keep their employees and support operations as challenges remain due to the pandemic. \n\u201cAs an investment-attracting move, the CIT cut also alters the financial prospectus of the Philippines for the better,\u201d the groups said. \nThrough the flexibility to be given to the Fiscal Incentives Review Board and the President in the grant of incentives under CREATE, the groups are hopeful the country could attract high-value investments. \nThe groups said the 10-year transition period to be given under the bill to firms currently availing of incentives would also address concerns on the changes in the tax regime. \nEarlier this week, the country\u2019s largest business organization, the Philippine Chamber of Commerce and Industry, also urged the government to prioritize the passage of CREATE. \nSource: https://www.philstar.com/business/2021/01/16/2070688/over-50-business-groups-back-passage-create \n\nThe post Over 50 business groups back passage of CREATE appeared first on Arangkada Philippines.",

                "text": "A year after the lockdown imposed in the Chinese city of Wuhan shocked the world, the tactic is turning out to be an enduring tool for quelling the coronavirus almost everywhere. \nWhen the first large-scale lockdown in modern times was implemented in China on Jan. 23 at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, it was then deemed unproven and unthinkable, particularly by democratic governments who balked at the implications for human rights violations of limiting citizens\u2019 freedom of movement on such a huge scale. \nYet almost 12 months on, the U.K. is in the midst of its third nationwide lockdown as it battles a mutated strain of the coronavirus. In Australia, the recent discovery of one case in Brisbane prompted a three-day lockdown. And China, which is experiencing its biggest outbreak since the start of the pandemic with over 500 cases, locked down three cities surrounding Beijing this month. \n\u201cPrior to COVID-19 there was a strong global health discourse that argued against lockdowns and similar mass quarantines. This is but one area of thinking that the current pandemic has overturned,\u201d said Nicholas Thomas, an associate professor in health security at the City University of Hong Kong. \n\u201cAs far as is possible, lockdowns are going to become part of the essential toolkit for governments to use in addressing the ongoing as well as future outbreaks,\u201d he said. \nWartime measures\nThe speed with which China locked down millions of people when the pandemic broke out marked the first time that the measure had been taken on such a massive scale in modern times. \nUntil last year, severe lockdowns were synonymous with the waves of bubonic plague that swept through Europe from the 14th century. Even during the Spanish flu of the early 20th century, no lockdowns were centrally imposed. China did, however, impose three major lockdowns in recent history: during a bubonic plague outbreak in its northeast in 1901, and two short ones following the 2008 Sichuan earthquake and another amid a bubonic plague outbreak in Gansu province in 2014. \nForeign countries who were taken aback at the Wuhan lockdown found themselves doing much the same just months later as the virus spread uncontrollably. \nAfter an infectious disease reaches a certain number of people, lockdowns can\u2019t be avoided because no other measure can stem spread, said Jiang Qingwu, a professor of epidemiology at Shanghai\u2019s Fudan University. \nIt is clear, however, that there remains a large gulf between what the Chinese government is able to impose on its citizens during a lockdown compared with democratic countries. Ever quick to declare what the government routinely refers to as \u201cwartime\u201d measures in response to relatively low numbers of infections, local authorities also ensured compliance by actions such as totally sealing off residential compounds. In some cases, people are not allowed to leave to get food, with deliveries arranged to them instead. \nAccording to the authors of a study conducted by Bloomberg Economics comparing how democratic countries fared against more authoritarian ones in dealing with the pandemic, \u201ca rapid and stringent lockdown is the kind of knee-jerk reaction that comes more naturally to authoritarian than democratic regimes.\u201d \nIn China\u2019s latest lockdown in Shijiazhuang, the capital of Hebei province, the stringent measures are reminiscent of those from the Wuhan lockdown, which ended on April 8 after infections dwindled to zero. Residents in the northeastern city, 180 miles (290 kilometers) southwest of Beijing, are required to stay home for seven days as the city embarks on a second round of mass testing for the entire population of 11 million as cases in the region exceed 500. Flights and trains into and out of the city have been halted, as well as almost all public transport. \nPolice officers and a medical worker wait for drivers at a checkpoint in Yunxi county, Hunan province, in January last year. | REUTERS\n \nIn contrast, democracies such as the U.K., in their versions of lockdowns, have generally allowed people to leave the house to purchase essentials such as food and medicine, walk their dogs or exercise. Schools remained open in France\u2019s autumn lockdown, while in its latest two-week lockdown this month, Israel is allowing people to gather outdoors in groups of up to 10, with exemptions for religious activities. \nBut there have also been examples of democratic governments imposing extreme rules. One state government in Australia, where officials have reacted fiercely to flare-ups, banned even outdoor exercise and dog-walking during a brief lockdown in November. \nWinter resurgence\nChinese authorities argue that the country\u2019s bounce-back from the crisis proves that their approach works. And a winter resurgence of the virus in countries like South Korea, Japan and Sweden, which originally saw success with a minimal-disruption approach that avoided lockdowns, buttresses the argument for stricter measures, particularly as fatigued citizens flout stay-at-home advice. \n\u201cGiven the huge number and high density of China, we have proved that (these measures) are very effective,\u201d said Mi Feng, a spokesperson at the country\u2019s National Health Commission. \nIn addition to concerns over civil liberties, many governments remain hesitant to impose the sorts of full lockdowns as seen in China because of the economic cost \u2014 though research by the International Monetary Fund\u2019s latest World Economic Outlook showed that if countries were decisive in taking such measures, they performed better in terms of protecting the economy. New Zealand is one such example, recording just 25 deaths after quickly imposing lockdowns, with life resuming to near normality soon after. \nA shuttered souvenir shop on Oxford Street in central London on Friday. The U.K. has entered its third nationwide coronavirus lockdown. | AFP-JIJI\n \nHowever, even China, whose economy has roared back to life, is cognizant of economic pressure. Since the Wuhan lockdown, authorities have tellingly steered clear of shutting down economically significant cities like Beijing despite substantial flareups. Officials turned largely to aggressive contact-tracing during an outbreak in the capital last summer. \n\u201cEffective as lockdowns are, they are costly,\u201d said Yanzhong Huang, Director of the Center for Global Health Studies at New Jersey\u2019s Seton Hall University. \u201cEven for China, it\u2019s unsustainable in the long term,\u201d he added, likening reflexive lockdown decisions to \u201cshooting cannonballs at mosquitoes.\u201d \nWith vaccinations drives now being rapidly rolled out across major western countries and China, the hope is that lockdowns will be far less common in 2021, though substantial uncertainty remains over how long it\u2019ll take to vaccinate enough of the world population to safely re-open the global economy. \nDespite the economic implications, COVID-19\u2019s legacy is likely that lockdowns will continue to be deployed during outbreaks of highly communicable diseases in the future, especially since they\u2019re now a familiar concept to people everywhere for the first time in a century. \n\u201cRestrictive quarantine itself is not a new invention and its application dates back to the Black Death in the medieval times,\u201d said Huang. \u201cBut it\u2019s ironic that such an old method remains the most effective despite the tremendous progress in medical sciences.\u201d \nA woman is reflected in a shop window in Lisbon on Friday as Portugal entered a fresh lockdown over a surge in coronavirus cases. | AFP-JIJI\n \nAn empty street in Yueyang, Hunan province, in January last year, amid the partial lockdown of neighboring Hubei province | REUTERS\n\nIn a time of both misinformation and too much information, quality journalism is more crucial than ever.

Here\u2019s the realitySteve LeVine20 hours ago\u00b7Photo illustration, sources: Vintage Images; Jasmin Merdan/Moment; Issarawat Tattong/Moment (via Getty)Inrecent years, leading economists, investors, and journalists have painted a decidedly grim vision of our near future: The U.S. economic system and society itself are coming apart, these dystopian voices have said, beset by one of the darkest chapters in the country\u2019s history, including a pandemic, a jobs apocalypse, and now a deadly attack on Congress. Yet, in one of the most whiplash-inducing spiritual flip-flops in memory, the new zeitgeist for the next decade is shimmering positivism. The\u00a0Economist\u00a0is tantalized by hints of\u00a0\u201ca new period of economic dynamism,\u201d\u00a0and the Financial Times of \u201ca once-in-a-century boom.\u201d\u00a0The\u00a0Wall Street Journal\u00a0foresees\u00a0the best era for manufacturing\u00a0since the 1990s, and even Nobel laureate Paul Krugman, one of the most convinced curmudgeons in economics,\u00a0is foreshadowing\u00a0a fresh period of expansion. Observing so much sunniness, economics blogger Noah Smith has compiled highlights into a\u00a0\u201ctechno-optimism roundup.\u201d Perhaps unsurprisingly, these positivists have declared what they are predicting \u201cthe new Roaring Twenties.\u201d A century after the iconic decade of prosperous decadence, the thesis is that the United States and perhaps the rest of the world are on the cusp of one of the biggest outbreaks of economic sizzle in memory. With 1.8 million people dead around the world from Covid-19, including some 350,000 in the U.S., along with all the country\u2019s other problems, it\u2019s become almost too seductive to resist\u00a0harking back\u00a0to better times. And what better times to recapture than those of Gatsby, flappers, flippant Chicago gangsters, and jazz-infused speakeasies? Our Economy Was Just Blasted Years Into the FutureThe crisis is compressing and accelerating trends that would have taken decades to play outmarker.medium.comBut are the positivists right? For the next couple of years, they seem almost certain to be. As increasing numbers of people are vaccinated and the country reopens, Americans are likely to bolt into a bacchanalia of dining, drinking, travel, and other revelry. Travel businesses are already seeing bookings that would carry this pent-up partying all the way through 2022 and into 2023. The question is what happens after the merry-making dies down. Is there enough underlying zip in the economy to sustain a boom for the remainder of the decade? History is fixated on the glitz, but the decade\u2019s deeper roar arose from below \u2014 from a vast, subterranean engine of commerce that pushed to the surface after World War I and the Spanish Flu pandemic, and ignited an age of consumer convenience. In the 1920s, there was. History is fixated on the glitz, but the decade\u2019s deeper roar arose from below \u2014 from a vast, subterranean engine of commerce that pushed to the surface after World War I and the Spanish Flu pandemic, and ignited an age of consumer convenience: Across the country, companies delivered the first affordable vacuum cleaner, washing machine, temperature-adjustable iron, and food mixer, not to mention the automobile \u2014 an economy-driving treasure of inventions. By the end of the decade, Ford Motor, General Electric, Westinghouse and other companies had utterly transformed the American lifestyle into one befitting a new urban prosperity of nearly full employment and real annual GDP growth of 4.8%. If one wished to boil down the decade\u2019s zing to two words, it would be electricity and combustion, a one-two technological punch that streamlined urban housework and took Americans out onto the road, thereby reverberating across the economy. Today, numerous economists and technologists say that long-gestating technologies may be ready to propel a similar frenzy of commerce. This time, the economic engine might start with artificial intelligence; the pharmaceutical industry, turbo-charged by the historically fast creation of the Covid-19 vaccine;\u00a0a new era of super-batteries and electric vehicles; and a re-imagination of cities, with much of the workforce\u00a0permanently dialing in\u00a0from home. A currently dammed-up tidal wave of cash could finance this economic deluge, these economists say \u2014 some $3.7 trillion sitting on the sidelines in personal savings accounts and corporate cash reserves. But the forecasts hinge on a number of presumptions. Even if you accept that a ton of cool, potentially economy-driving ideas may be out there on the horizon, who is to say their time will come in the 2020s \u2014 or whether, like the refrigerator, which only took hold in the 1930s, when their high price dropped, they are likelier to ripen in the\u00a0next\u00a0decade? What if we are actually looking at a Thundering Thirties? It is also reasonable to be suspicious of the crowd \u2014 when most of the thinking class has coalesced in a single direction, an undiscriminating herd mentality may have taken hold, especially since, when the world has hit rock bottom, it may be inviting to join in collective wishful thinking. In just one contrary opinion, the World Bank last week\u00a0released a forecast\u00a0of a potential \u201clost decade\u201d in the 2020s, with tepid 1.9% annual growth. \u201cIf history is any guide,\u201d\u00a0the report says, \u201cunless there are substantial and effective reforms, the global economy is heading for a decade of disappointing growth outcomes.\u201d But in several important ways, the 1920s and the 2020s already do resemble one another. That is in the presence of pronounced inequality, a rural-urban divide, and a financial bubble. And by the end of 1929, we know how those circumstances ended. In1882, Thomas Edison ordered a switch flipped and a hundred lights went on in the Wall Street offices of the Gilded Age financier J.P. Morgan, the nearby headquarters of the\u00a0New York Times, and numerous other Lower Manhattan buildings. It was the start of the age of electricity. Soon Edison was supplying enough power for about 10,000 electric lights. The number of customers was limited by the high cost \u2014 30 cents per kWh \u2014 which only the richest businesses and wealthiest families could afford. But by 1920, the retail price had plunged to around 10 cents, and electric lines were extended to a third of American homes. Four decades after Edison lit up Lower Manhattan, the American economy was ablaze. Along the way, a young Connecticut manufacturer named Harvey Hubbell invented the electric plug, and tinkerers began to push out patents for various gadgets \u2014 the electric iron in 1882, the washing machine in 1907, the vacuum cleaner in 1908, the waffle iron in 1911, and more. None was an immediate commercial success \u2014 most were unwieldy and far too expensive. But then suddenly, coinciding with cheap electricity, gadgets with a plug were sleek and relatively affordable. Hotpoint introduced practical electric stoves, Hamilton Beach offered hand-held electric egg beaters, and Maytag began selling the first washing machines featuring an agitator. Toastmaster gave U.S. homes the first automatic pop-up toaster capable of browning both sides of the bread at once, and Ford dropped the price of his Model T from $965 to $269. The End of the Booming Mask Economy Is NearFrom Gap to Vistaprint, companies are betting on masks to save them. But what happens when the bubble pops?marker.medium.comFour decades after Edison lit up Lower Manhattan, the American economy was ablaze. It amounted to an economic paradigm shift. In a milestone\u00a01989 paper, Paul David, a Stanford economics professor, wrote that electricity had followed a natural arc. Like steam a century before, electricity was a \u201cgeneral purpose technology\u201d that, after decades of gestation, was propelling not only itself to enormous success, but countless other industries and the entire economy. But the crucial thing to understand about general purpose technologies was that, while ingenious and potent in theory, to succeed they required other industries and segments of society to entirely reorganize around them \u2014 they had to align with the new technology. And unless they did, the new technology was fated to be a glorified experiment. In the case of Edison, he created a frenzy among cities around the world desiring to push back the night. But manufacturers hesitated, Stanford\u2019s David wrote, because they saw it in their interest to keep using the steam engines they had already paid for. To switch to electric motors, they would have to create entirely new equipment and retrain workers. Even when they deployed some electric motors, manufacturers often did so side by side with the old equipment in the same factory, avoiding the cost of full replacement. Even General Electric and Westinghouse themselves \u2014 the providers of the electricity \u2014 kept their prices high in order to keep milking profits from the legacy equipment they also sold. All this dilly-dallying and duplicate spending sapped the economy of vitality. From 1890 through 1912, U.S. productivity sunk and wage growth flattened. When World War I ended, a mini-depression took hold. It was only when manufacturers finally surrendered to electricity and the combustion motor, retooling their factories around the two technologies, that the Roaring Twenties as we know them began to unfold. A similar effect happened again some seven decades later. In the late \u201980s, when David wrote his paper on the history of productivity, his economist colleagues were obsessed with what they saw as the failure of the computer age. Intel had walloped everyone with its 1970 invention of the microprocessor. Yet productivity and wage growth had been relatively stagnant in the two decades since. Apart from a single blip of years,\u00a0annual labor productivity growth\u00a0had averaged just 1.4% since 1970, about half the rate experienced since World War II. Annual real income had grown by more than 2.5% from 1948 through 1972, but just 0.5% since.\u00a0That is, the computer \u2014 another general purpose technology \u2014 simply hadn\u2019t improved the economy. But David suggested that his colleagues were ignoring history. The economy was exhibiting the same sluggishness as it had while electricity and internal combustion were wending their way through industry in the early 1900s. As happened back then, the rest of the economy had to cooperate with the new general purpose technology before the gains were seen. No economists appear to expect anything except that Americans as a group will emerge from Covid-19 and gorge in restaurants, drink like fish, and travel with abandon. Which is what happened just six years later. In 1995, productivity began to surge. For the subsequent decade, it averaged 2.8% a year. Around 2005, though, the productivity spurt again abruptly halted. And in the decade and a half since, the microprocessor and its progeny have again failed to deliver the 4.8% annual gains of the 1920s, less the average 2.7%-a-year growth of the 1950s and 1960s. Today, like the post-World War I period, we remain in the grip of a pandemic and a deep recession. The question is whether, on the horizon just out of sight, we also have the technological and industrial ingredients of a boom. And, perhaps more important, whether the economy has undergone enough of an adjustment to parlay that technology into a new roaring decade. Bythe end of this year,\u00a0economists are expecting\u00a0a consumer spending binge, one so powerful that it will drive 3.8% economic growth for 2021 as a whole.\u00a0UCLA Anderson Forecast, a think tank at the university, predicts the splurging will begin even earlier and propel\u00a06% second-quarter growth. Whichever the case, no economists appear to expect anything except that Americans as a group will emerge from Covid-19 and gorge in restaurants, drink like fish, and travel with abandon. Indeed, the country is already displaying signs of what is coming: Cruise lines say they\u00a0are getting booked up\u00a0for later this year through 2023. Luxury tour operators, too, say\u00a0travel bookings\u00a0for next year and beyond are surging. Such spending would be buttressed by a powerful secondary economic punch. To understand why, consider last year\u2019s\u00a0hospitality industry bloodbath. Some 110,000\u00a0restaurants have closed\u00a0nationwide during the pandemic, according to the National Restaurant Association, an especially gutting number. In order to serve that orgy of hungry and boozy Americans, investors will have to come off the sidelines and fund a reopening of shuttered establishments and launch new ones, igniting a considerable design and construction boom. Restaurants and bars will hire not just servers and barkeeps, but construction workers, plumbers, and specialists in the installation of virus protection technology and equipment. But the positivists believe that the key commercial products are already in our vision and possibly already for sale. They simply have not gone viral yet. UCLA Anderson expects this deluge to carry the economy through 2023. But, as in the 1920s, an undertow will be required to propel an elevated, decade-long economic surge. The U.S. will require a mature general purpose technology, in addition to assorted other thriving industries. In terms of the latter, there is no way of knowing with certainty what they will be \u2014 after all, in 2006, who forecast the smartphone revolution that arrived the very next year with the first iPhone? But the positivists believe that the key commercial products are already in our vision and possibly already for sale. They simply have not gone viral yet. Austin Was Destined to Replace Silicon Valley. Then the Pandemic HitCan the hottest boomtown off the coasts survive a recession\u2014and a Covid surge?marker.medium.comThe most obvious candidate for this general purpose technology is artificial intelligence. The fundamental breakthroughs in the most popular current forms of A.I. were made in the 1980s by pioneers like Geoffrey Hinton, at the University of Toronto, and Judah Pearl, a professor at UCLA. Meaning that it\u2019s been almost four decades since their early advances. No one thinks that A.I. is anywhere near the level of human intelligence. But it would not require human-like intelligence to start to underpin an economic surge, the positivists suggest. The question is whether there has been enough time for industries, business processes and skills to adjust to the relatively elementary machine intelligence we now have. Erik Brynjolfsson, an economics professor at Stanford and co-author of a\u00a0widely circulated paper\u00a0last year that in part pivots on Paul David\u2019s work, says early A.I. has gestated long enough. In the paper, Brynjolfsson and his co-authors describe the path of general purpose technologies as a figure \u201cJ.\u201d The bottom loop of the letter represents the arrival of a potentially breakthrough technology and the typical subsequent period of stagnation \u201cas people figure out how to use it,\u201d he told me. The vertical line in the J reflects what happens next \u2014 \u201cProductivity goes up sharply,\u201d he said. \u201cI think we just turned the corner on machine learning. I anticipate a takeoff in the coming decade.\u201d Brynjolfsson thinks that A.I.-driven voice recognition and software that writes like humans will become much more commercially significant. Self-driving software will mature, and a biotech boom built on the mRNA method used to defeat Covid-19 will take off. Electric cars propelled by\u00a0super-batteries\u00a0will capture an increasing percentage of new car sales. Richard Watson, a futurist at Cambridge University, expects a boom in robots, starting with surgical robots, companion robots, and sex robots. \u201cIn Japan you have avatar girlfriends,\u201d Watson told me. \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t be surprising to see people forming stronger relationships with robots than with people \u2014 with emotionally aware machines, where you trust machines more than people.\u201d Such technologies, he said, would result in \u201cSilicon Valley with the volume turned up to 11.\u201d How certain is this boom? Chad Syverson, an economist at the University of Chicago and a co-author of the J-Curve paper, is a pioneer of a theory of productivity waves. Internal combustion had multiple productivity surges,\u00a0Syverson argues, leading to a leap in growth in the 1920s, followed by a years-long slowdown, then a new spurt. Similarly, he thinks that the 1995\u20132005 jump in productivity may have been only the first stage of a microprocessor-led wave. In an email, Syverson suggested that the new Roaring Twenties would be the second wave. \u201cWill we see the nearly 3% annual labor productivity growth of past waves? I don\u2019t know,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I would be disappointed, and start worrying if the next wave is coming, and we don\u2019t see 2%.\u201d A roaring 2020s would consist of non-intelligent products, too, the positivists say. The pandemic itself, and our reaction to it, are possible clues to what\u2019s coming. James Cham, a venture capitalist in Silicon Valley, notes that the Zoom app was released in 2013. \u201cBut it took Covid for it to take off,\u201d he points out. David Staley, a historian at Ohio State, says that the sudden ubiquity of Zoom represents more, which is the rise of delivered services. Zoom brought Staley\u2019s workplace right to his home office. Peloton, he said, brought the gym. DoorDash is bringing restaurants. He expects Zoomification \u2014 the transportation of physical businesses to consumers\u2019 homes \u2014 to be a 2020s growth industry. \u201cThat could be the next big economic driver,\u201d he said. \u201cMaking reality mobile.\u201d The hedonistic 1920s climaxed in a gigantic, end-of-decade collision on Oct. 24, 1929. For the prior 19 consecutive months, the entire nation had seemed to be borrowing money to trade the share of the moment and earn a fortune. The stalwarts of the economy soared in value: AT&T\u2019s share price rose by 87%, U.S. Steel doubled, and GE shares more than tripled in price. The subsequent crash ended the original Roaring Twenties, and opened up a tragically sad new decade of want and revolutionary anger. As the end of the 1920s neared, the nation\u2019s top 36,000 families were earning as much as the rest of the nation\u2019s 12 million families. Up to 60% of the country lived below the poverty line. Rural America was worse off, largely left out of the revolution on American roads and in American homes. At the end of the decade, just 10% of rural houses had electricity, while in cities the percentage was about 85%. From magazine ads, the rural population could see and feel its deprivation: Resentment seethed below the surface and emerged sharply in the next few years. That today\u2019s economy features both of these primary shortcomings, too \u2014 the failure to spread the wealth and to curb stock market excess \u2014 is a flashing red light. The pandemic has deepened the modern U.S. wealth gap: The top 1% holds 15 times as much wealth as the bottom half combined,\u00a0according to Fed data. The Nasdaq rose 43% last year, and bitcoin\u00a0quadrupled in price, while gyrating wildly so far this year \u2014 signs of froth. Like the working-class anger that seethed below the surface during the 1920s, only to erupt after the Depression, this modern concentration of wealth is a red-flashing warning sign, reflected in part in last week\u2019s attack on the Capitol building. There is also the possibility that the Roaring Twenties happens, but mostly in China, which is pouring outsized sums of investment into futuristic technologies and infrastructure. The positivists ignore some raw material lacking in their argument: The Roaring Twenties were fueled in no small part by a youthful population with a median age of 25; two thirds of the country was 35 and younger, filled with verve and entrepreneurialism. The median age today is closing in on 40, and even before Covid-19 the\u00a0formation rate for new startups\u00a0was dropping. Among the primary schools of economic thought are that the country\u2019s big technological advances have\u00a0tailed off\u00a0since around 1970 after a century of stratospheric achievements. David Hochfelder, a professor of the history of business and technology at the State University of New York at Albany, thinks this inventive dry spell is a reason\u00a0not\u00a0to expect a new decade resembling the 1920s, years when Einstein won his Nobel, Edwin Hubble found the expanding universe, and Alexander Fleming invented penicillin. \u201cWe are not likely to see a transformation like the automobile, like electrification, like the indoor toilet, or talking films,\u201d Hochfelder says. There is also the possibility that the Roaring Twenties happens, but mostly in China, which is pouring outsized sums of investment into futuristic technologies and infrastructure. Or that it keeps buoying already-prosperous tech hotspots like Silicon Valley and Boston, but largely leaves out the rest of the U.S. These cautionary notes are not necessarily evidence that high expectations for the decade are irrational. But some historians hope that, if the positivists are correct, there is time to get a potentially prosperous new decade right this time. As things stand, we may drive headlong into a new gilded age, says Joseph Brusuelas, chief economist at auditing firm RSM. The 1920s \u201clooked like a lot of fun from a distance,\u201d says Beverly Gage, a history professor at Yale, \u201cbut what comes next was a lot more complicated.\u201d   https://marker.medium.com/will-the-2020s-really-become-the-next-roaring-twenties-5a05ce995499",

Here\u2019s the realitySteve LeVine20 hours ago\u00b7Photo illustration, sources: Vintage Images; Jasmin Merdan/Moment; Issarawat Tattong/Moment (via Getty)Inrecent years, leading economists, investors, and journalists have painted a decidedly grim vision of our near future: The U.S. economic system and society itself are coming apart, these dystopian voices have said, beset by one of the darkest chapters in the country\u2019s history, including a pandemic, a jobs apocalypse, and now a deadly attack on Congress. Yet, in one of the most whiplash-inducing spiritual flip-flops in memory, the new zeitgeist for the next decade is shimmering positivism. The\u00a0Economist\u00a0is tantalized by hints of\u00a0\u201ca new period of economic dynamism,\u201d\u00a0and the Financial Times of \u201ca once-in-a-century boom.\u201d\u00a0The\u00a0Wall Street Journal\u00a0foresees\u00a0the best era for manufacturing\u00a0since the 1990s, and even Nobel laureate Paul Krugman, one of the most convinced curmudgeons in economics,\u00a0is foreshadowing\u00a0a fresh period of expansion. Observing so much sunniness, economics blogger Noah Smith has compiled highlights into a\u00a0\u201ctechno-optimism roundup.\u201d Perhaps unsurprisingly, these positivists have declared what they are predicting \u201cthe new Roaring Twenties.\u201d A century after the iconic decade of prosperous decadence, the thesis is that the United States and perhaps the rest of the world are on the cusp of one of the biggest outbreaks of economic sizzle in memory. With 1.8 million people dead around the world from Covid-19, including some 350,000 in the U.S., along with all the country\u2019s other problems, it\u2019s become almost too seductive to resist\u00a0harking back\u00a0to better times. And what better times to recapture than those of Gatsby, flappers, flippant Chicago gangsters, and jazz-infused speakeasies? Our Economy Was Just Blasted Years Into the FutureThe crisis is compressing and accelerating trends that would have taken decades to play outmarker.medium.comBut are the positivists right? For the next couple of years, they seem almost certain to be. As increasing numbers of people are vaccinated and the country reopens, Americans are likely to bolt into a bacchanalia of dining, drinking, travel, and other revelry. Travel businesses are already seeing bookings that would carry this pent-up partying all the way through 2022 and into 2023. The question is what happens after the merry-making dies down. Is there enough underlying zip in the economy to sustain a boom for the remainder of the decade?

In the 1920s, there was. History is fixated on the glitz, but the decade\u2019s deeper roar arose from below \u2014 from a vast, subterranean engine of commerce that pushed to the surface after World War I and the Spanish Flu pandemic, and ignited an age of consumer convenience: Across the country, companies delivered the first affordable vacuum cleaner, washing machine, temperature-adjustable iron, and food mixer, not to mention the automobile \u2014 an economy-driving treasure of inventions. By the end of the decade, Ford Motor, General Electric, Westinghouse and other companies had utterly transformed the American lifestyle into one befitting a new urban prosperity of nearly full employment and real annual GDP growth of 4.8%. If one wished to boil down the decade\u2019s zing to two words, it would be electricity and combustion, a one-two technological punch that streamlined urban housework and took Americans out onto the road, thereby reverberating across the economy. Today, numerous economists and technologists say that long-gestating technologies may be ready to propel a similar frenzy of commerce. This time, the economic engine might start with artificial intelligence; the pharmaceutical industry, turbo-charged by the historically fast creation of the Covid-19 vaccine;\u00a0a new era of super-batteries and electric vehicles; and a re-imagination of cities, with much of the workforce\u00a0permanently dialing in\u00a0from home. A currently dammed-up tidal wave of cash could finance this economic deluge, these economists say \u2014 some $3.7 trillion sitting on the sidelines in personal savings accounts and corporate cash reserves. But the forecasts hinge on a number of presumptions. Even if you accept that a ton of cool, potentially economy-driving ideas may be out there on the horizon, who is to say their time will come in the 2020s \u2014 or whether, like the refrigerator, which only took hold in the 1930s, when their high price dropped, they are likelier to ripen in the\u00a0next\u00a0decade? What if we are actually looking at a Thundering Thirties? It is also reasonable to be suspicious of the crowd \u2014 when most of the thinking class has coalesced in a single direction, an undiscriminating herd mentality may have taken hold, especially since, when the world has hit rock bottom, it may be inviting to join in collective wishful thinking. In just one contrary opinion, the World Bank last week\u00a0released a forecast\u00a0of a potential \u201clost decade\u201d in the 2020s, with tepid 1.9% annual growth. \u201cIf history is any guide,\u201d\u00a0the report says, \u201cunless there are substantial and effective reforms, the global economy is heading for a decade of disappointing growth outcomes.\u201d But in several important ways, the 1920s and the 2020s already do resemble one another. That is in the presence of pronounced inequality, a rural-urban divide, and a financial bubble. And by the end of 1929, we know how those circumstances ended. In1882, Thomas Edison ordered a switch flipped and a hundred lights went on in the Wall Street offices of the Gilded Age financier J.P. Morgan, the nearby headquarters of the\u00a0New York Times, and numerous other Lower Manhattan buildings. It was the start of the age of electricity. Soon Edison was supplying enough power for about 10,000 electric lights. The number of customers was limited by the high cost \u2014 30 cents per kWh \u2014 which only the richest businesses and wealthiest families could afford. But by 1920, the retail price had plunged to around 10 cents, and electric lines were extended to a third of American homes. Four decades after Edison lit up Lower Manhattan, the American economy was ablaze. Along the way, a young Connecticut manufacturer named Harvey Hubbell invented the electric plug, and tinkerers began to push out patents for various gadgets \u2014 the electric iron in 1882, the washing machine in 1907, the vacuum cleaner in 1908, the waffle iron in 1911, and more. None was an immediate commercial success \u2014 most were unwieldy and far too expensive. But then suddenly, coinciding with cheap electricity, gadgets with a plug were sleek and relatively affordable. Hotpoint introduced practical electric stoves, Hamilton Beach offered hand-held electric egg beaters, and Maytag began selling the first washing machines featuring an agitator. Toastmaster gave U.S. homes the first automatic pop-up toaster capable of browning both sides of the bread at once, and Ford dropped the price of his Model T from $965 to $269. The End of the Booming Mask Economy Is NearFrom Gap to Vistaprint, companies are betting on masks to save them. But what happens when the bubble pops?marker.medium.comFour decades after Edison lit up Lower Manhattan, the American economy was ablaze. It amounted to an economic paradigm shift. In a milestone\u00a01989 paper, Paul David, a Stanford economics professor, wrote that electricity had followed a natural arc. Like steam a century before, electricity was a \u201cgeneral purpose technology\u201d that, after decades of gestation, was propelling not only itself to enormous success, but countless other industries and the entire economy. But the crucial thing to understand about general purpose technologies was that, while ingenious and potent in theory, to succeed they required other industries and segments of society to entirely reorganize around them \u2014 they had to align with the new technology. And unless they did, the new technology was fated to be a glorified experiment. In the case of Edison, he created a frenzy among cities around the world desiring to push back the night. But manufacturers hesitated, Stanford\u2019s David wrote, because they saw it in their interest to keep using the steam engines they had already paid for. To switch to electric motors, they would have to create entirely new equipment and retrain workers. Even when they deployed some electric motors, manufacturers often did so side by side with the old equipment in the same factory, avoiding the cost of full replacement. Even General Electric and Westinghouse themselves \u2014 the providers of the electricity \u2014 kept their prices high in order to keep milking profits from the legacy equipment they also sold. All this dilly-dallying and duplicate spending sapped the economy of vitality. From 1890 through 1912, U.S. productivity sunk and wage growth flattened. When World War I ended, a mini-depression took hold. It was only when manufacturers finally surrendered to electricity and the combustion motor, retooling their factories around the two technologies, that the Roaring Twenties as we know them began to unfold. A similar effect happened again some seven decades later. In the late \u201980s, when David wrote his paper on the history of productivity, his economist colleagues were obsessed with what they saw as the failure of the computer age. Intel had walloped everyone with its 1970 invention of the microprocessor. Yet productivity and wage growth had been relatively stagnant in the two decades since. Apart from a single blip of years,\u00a0annual labor productivity growth\u00a0had averaged just 1.4% since 1970, about half the rate experienced since World War II. Annual real income had grown by more than 2.5% from 1948 through 1972, but just 0.5% since.\u00a0That is, the computer \u2014 another general purpose technology \u2014 simply hadn\u2019t improved the economy. But David suggested that his colleagues were ignoring history. The economy was exhibiting the same sluggishness as it had while electricity and internal combustion were wending their way through industry in the early 1900s. As happened back then, the rest of the economy had to cooperate with the new general purpose technology before the gains were seen. No economists appear to expect anything except that Americans as a group will emerge from Covid-19 and gorge in restaurants, drink like fish, and travel with abandon. Which is what happened just six years later. In 1995, productivity began to surge. For the subsequent decade, it averaged 2.8% a year. Around 2005, though, the productivity spurt again abruptly halted. And in the decade and a half since, the microprocessor and its progeny have again failed to deliver the 4.8% annual gains of the 1920s, less the average 2.7%-a-year growth of the 1950s and 1960s. Today, like the post-World War I period, we remain in the grip of a pandemic and a deep recession. The question is whether, on the horizon just out of sight, we also have the technological and industrial ingredients of a boom. And, perhaps more important, whether the economy has undergone enough of an adjustment to parlay that technology into a new roaring decade. Bythe end of this year,\u00a0economists are expecting\u00a0a consumer spending binge, one so powerful that it will drive 3.8% economic growth for 2021 as a whole.\u00a0UCLA Anderson Forecast, a think tank at the university, predicts the splurging will begin even earlier and propel\u00a06% second-quarter growth. Whichever the case, no economists appear to expect anything except that Americans as a group will emerge from Covid-19 and gorge in restaurants, drink like fish, and travel with abandon. Indeed, the country is already displaying signs of what is coming: Cruise lines say they\u00a0are getting booked up\u00a0for later this year through 2023. Luxury tour operators, too, say\u00a0travel bookings\u00a0for next year and beyond are surging. Such spending would be buttressed by a powerful secondary economic punch. To understand why, consider last year\u2019s\u00a0hospitality industry bloodbath. Some 110,000\u00a0restaurants have closed\u00a0nationwide during the pandemic, according to the National Restaurant Association, an especially gutting number. In order to serve that orgy of hungry and boozy Americans, investors will have to come off the sidelines and fund a reopening of shuttered establishments and launch new ones, igniting a considerable design and construction boom. Restaurants and bars will hire not just servers and barkeeps, but construction workers, plumbers, and specialists in the installation of virus protection technology and equipment. But the positivists believe that the key commercial products are already in our vision and possibly already for sale. They simply have not gone viral yet. UCLA Anderson expects this deluge to carry the economy through 2023. But, as in the 1920s, an undertow will be required to propel an elevated, decade-long economic surge. The U.S. will require a mature general purpose technology, in addition to assorted other thriving industries. In terms of the latter, there is no way of knowing with certainty what they will be \u2014 after all, in 2006, who forecast the smartphone revolution that arrived the very next year with the first iPhone? But the positivists believe that the key commercial products are already in our vision and possibly already for sale. They simply have not gone viral yet. Austin Was Destined to Replace Silicon Valley. Then the Pandemic HitCan the hottest boomtown off the coasts survive a recession\u2014and a Covid surge?marker.medium.comThe most obvious candidate for this general purpose technology is artificial intelligence. The fundamental breakthroughs in the most popular current forms of A.I. were made in the 1980s by pioneers like Geoffrey Hinton, at the University of Toronto, and Judah Pearl, a professor at UCLA. Meaning that it\u2019s been almost four decades since their early advances. No one thinks that A.I. is anywhere near the level of human intelligence. But it would not require human-like intelligence to start to underpin an economic surge, the positivists suggest. The question is whether there has been enough time for industries, business processes and skills to adjust to the relatively elementary machine intelligence we now have. Erik Brynjolfsson, an economics professor at Stanford and co-author of a\u00a0widely circulated paper\u00a0last year that in part pivots on Paul David\u2019s work, says early A.I. has gestated long enough. In the paper, Brynjolfsson and his co-authors describe the path of general purpose technologies as a figure \u201cJ.\u201d The bottom loop of the letter represents the arrival of a potentially breakthrough technology and the typical subsequent period of stagnation \u201cas people figure out how to use it,\u201d he told me. The vertical line in the J reflects what happens next \u2014 \u201cProductivity goes up sharply,\u201d he said. \u201cI think we just turned the corner on machine learning. I anticipate a takeoff in the coming decade.\u201d Brynjolfsson thinks that A.I.-driven voice recognition and software that writes like humans will become much more commercially significant. Self-driving software will mature, and a biotech boom built on the mRNA method used to defeat Covid-19 will take off. Electric cars propelled by\u00a0super-batteries\u00a0will capture an increasing percentage of new car sales. Richard Watson, a futurist at Cambridge University, expects a boom in robots, starting with surgical robots, companion robots, and sex robots. \u201cIn Japan you have avatar girlfriends,\u201d Watson told me. \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t be surprising to see people forming stronger relationships with robots than with people \u2014 with emotionally aware machines, where you trust machines more than people.\u201d Such technologies, he said, would result in \u201cSilicon Valley with the volume turned up to 11.\u201d How certain is this boom? Chad Syverson, an economist at the University of Chicago and a co-author of the J-Curve paper, is a pioneer of a theory of productivity waves. Internal combustion had multiple productivity surges,\u00a0Syverson argues, leading to a leap in growth in the 1920s, followed by a years-long slowdown, then a new spurt. Similarly, he thinks that the 1995\u20132005 jump in productivity may have been only the first stage of a microprocessor-led wave. In an email, Syverson suggested that the new Roaring Twenties would be the second wave. \u201cWill we see the nearly 3% annual labor productivity growth of past waves? I don\u2019t know,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I would be disappointed, and start worrying if the next wave is coming, and we don\u2019t see 2%.\u201d A roaring 2020s would consist of non-intelligent products, too, the positivists say. The pandemic itself, and our reaction to it, are possible clues to what\u2019s coming. James Cham, a venture capitalist in Silicon Valley, notes that the Zoom app was released in 2013. \u201cBut it took Covid for it to take off,\u201d he points out. David Staley, a historian at Ohio State, says that the sudden ubiquity of Zoom represents more, which is the rise of delivered services. Zoom brought Staley\u2019s workplace right to his home office. Peloton, he said, brought the gym. DoorDash is bringing restaurants. He expects Zoomification \u2014 the transportation of physical businesses to consumers\u2019 homes \u2014 to be a 2020s growth industry. \u201cThat could be the next big economic driver,\u201d he said. \u201cMaking reality mobile.\u201d The hedonistic 1920s climaxed in a gigantic, end-of-decade collision on Oct. 24, 1929. For the prior 19 consecutive months, the entire nation had seemed to be borrowing money to trade the share of the moment and earn a fortune. The stalwarts of the economy soared in value: AT&T\u2019s share price rose by 87%, U.S. Steel doubled, and GE shares more than tripled in price. The subsequent crash ended the original Roaring Twenties, and opened up a tragically sad new decade of want and revolutionary anger. As the end of the 1920s neared, the nation\u2019s top 36,000 families were earning as much as the rest of the nation\u2019s 12 million families. Up to 60% of the country lived below the poverty line. Rural America was worse off, largely left out of the revolution on American roads and in American homes. At the end of the decade, just 10% of rural houses had electricity, while in cities the percentage was about 85%. From magazine ads, the rural population could see and feel its deprivation: Resentment seethed below the surface and emerged sharply in the next few years. That today\u2019s economy features both of these primary shortcomings, too \u2014 the failure to spread the wealth and to curb stock market excess \u2014 is a flashing red light. The pandemic has deepened the modern U.S. wealth gap: The top 1% holds 15 times as much wealth as the bottom half combined,\u00a0according to Fed data. The Nasdaq rose 43% last year, and bitcoin\u00a0quadrupled in price, while gyrating wildly so far this year \u2014 signs of froth. Like the working-class anger that seethed below the surface during the 1920s, only to erupt after the Depression, this modern concentration of wealth is a red-flashing warning sign, reflected in part in last week\u2019s attack on the Capitol building. There is also the possibility that the Roaring Twenties happens, but mostly in China, which is pouring outsized sums of investment into futuristic technologies and infrastructure. The positivists ignore some raw material lacking in their argument: The Roaring Twenties were fueled in no small part by a youthful population with a median age of 25; two thirds of the country was 35 and younger, filled with verve and entrepreneurialism. The median age today is closing in on 40, and even before Covid-19 the\u00a0formation rate for new startups\u00a0was dropping. Among the primary schools of economic thought are that the country\u2019s big technological advances have\u00a0tailed off\u00a0since around 1970 after a century of stratospheric achievements. David Hochfelder, a professor of the history of business and technology at the State University of New York at Albany, thinks this inventive dry spell is a reason\u00a0not\u00a0to expect a new decade resembling the 1920s, years when Einstein won his Nobel, Edwin Hubble found the expanding universe, and Alexander Fleming invented penicillin. \u201cWe are not likely to see a transformation like the automobile, like electrification, like the indoor toilet, or talking films,\u201d Hochfelder says. There is also the possibility that the Roaring Twenties happens, but mostly in China, which is pouring outsized sums of investment into futuristic technologies and infrastructure. Or that it keeps buoying already-prosperous tech hotspots like Silicon Valley and Boston, but largely leaves out the rest of the U.S. These cautionary notes are not necessarily evidence that high expectations for the decade are irrational. But some historians hope that, if the positivists are correct, there is time to get a potentially prosperous new decade right this time. As things stand, we may drive headlong into a new gilded age, says Joseph Brusuelas, chief economist at auditing firm RSM. The 1920s \u201clooked like a lot of fun from a distance,\u201d says Beverly Gage, a history professor at Yale, \u201cbut what comes next was a lot more complicated.\u201d   https://marker.medium.com/will-the-2020s-really-become-the-next-roaring-twenties-5a05ce995499",

                "text": "A year after the lockdown imposed in the Chinese city of Wuhan shocked the world, the tactic is turning out to be an enduring tool for quelling the coronavirus almost everywhere. \n\n\n\n\nWhen the first large-scale lockdown in modern times was implemented in China on Jan. 23 at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, it was then deemed unproven and unthinkable, particularly by democratic governments who balked at the implications for human rights violations of limiting citizens\u2019 freedom of movement on such a huge scale. \nYet almost 12 months on, the U.K. is in the midst of its third nationwide lockdown as it battles a mutated strain of the coronavirus. In Australia, the recent discovery of one case in Brisbane prompted a three-day lockdown. And China, which is experiencing its biggest outbreak since the start of the pandemic with over 500 cases, locked down three cities surrounding Beijing this month. \n\u201cPrior to COVID-19 there was a strong global health discourse that argued against lockdowns and similar mass quarantines. This is but one area of thinking that the current pandemic has overturned,\u201d said Nicholas Thomas, an associate professor in health security at the City University of Hong Kong. \n\u201cAs far as is possible, lockdowns are going to become part of the essential toolkit for governments to use in addressing the ongoing as well as future outbreaks,\u201d he said. \n\n\n\n\nWartime measures\nThe speed with which China locked down millions of people when the pandemic broke out marked the first time that the measure had been taken on such a massive scale in modern times. \nUntil last year, severe lockdowns were synonymous with the waves of bubonic plague that swept through Europe from the 14th century. Even during the Spanish flu of the early 20th century, no lockdowns were centrally imposed. China did, however, impose three major lockdowns in recent history: during a bubonic plague outbreak in its northeast in 1901, and two short ones following the 2008 Sichuan earthquake and another amid a bubonic plague outbreak in Gansu province in 2014. \nForeign countries who were taken aback at the Wuhan lockdown found themselves doing much the same just months later as the virus spread uncontrollably. \nAfter an infectious disease reaches a certain number of people, lockdowns can\u2019t be avoided because no other measure can stem spread, said Jiang Qingwu, a professor of epidemiology at Shanghai\u2019s Fudan University. \nIt is clear, however, that there remains a large gulf between what the Chinese government is able to impose on its citizens during a lockdown compared with democratic countries. Ever quick to declare what the government routinely refers to as \u201cwartime\u201d measures in response to relatively low numbers of infections, local authorities also ensured compliance by actions such as totally sealing off residential compounds. In some cases, people are not allowed to leave to get food, with deliveries arranged to them instead. \nAccording to the authors of a study conducted by Bloomberg Economics comparing how democratic countries fared against more authoritarian ones in dealing with the pandemic, \u201ca rapid and stringent lockdown is the kind of knee-jerk reaction that comes more naturally to authoritarian than democratic regimes.\u201d \nIn China\u2019s latest lockdown in Shijiazhuang, the capital of Hebei province, the stringent measures are reminiscent of those from the Wuhan lockdown, which ended on April 8 after infections dwindled to zero. Residents in the northeastern city, 180 miles (290 kilometers) southwest of Beijing, are required to stay home for seven days as the city embarks on a second round of mass testing for the entire population of 11 million as cases in the region exceed 500. Flights and trains into and out of the city have been halted, as well as almost all public transport. \nPolice officers and a medical worker wait for drivers at a checkpoint in Yunxi county, Hunan province, in January last year. | REUTERS\n \nIn contrast, democracies such as the U.K., in their versions of lockdowns, have generally allowed people to leave the house to purchase essentials such as food and medicine, walk their dogs or exercise. Schools remained open in France\u2019s autumn lockdown, while in its latest two-week lockdown this month, Israel is allowing people to gather outdoors in groups of up to 10, with exemptions for religious activities. \nBut there have also been examples of democratic governments imposing extreme rules. One state government in Australia, where officials have reacted fiercely to flare-ups, banned even outdoor exercise and dog-walking during a brief lockdown in November. \nWinter resurgence\nChinese authorities argue that the country\u2019s bounce-back from the crisis proves that their approach works. And a winter resurgence of the virus in countries like South Korea, Japan and Sweden, which originally saw success with a minimal-disruption approach that avoided lockdowns, buttresses the argument for stricter measures, particularly as fatigued citizens flout stay-at-home advice. \n\u201cGiven the huge number and high density of China, we have proved that (these measures) are very effective,\u201d said Mi Feng, a spokesperson at the country\u2019s National Health Commission. \nIn addition to concerns over civil liberties, many governments remain hesitant to impose the sorts of full lockdowns as seen in China because of the economic cost \u2014 though research by the International Monetary Fund\u2019s latest World Economic Outlook showed that if countries were decisive in taking such measures, they performed better in terms of protecting the economy. New Zealand is one such example, recording just 25 deaths after quickly imposing lockdowns, with life resuming to near normality soon after. \nA shuttered souvenir shop on Oxford Street in central London on Friday. The U.K. has entered its third nationwide coronavirus lockdown. | AFP-JIJI\n \nHowever, even China, whose economy has roared back to life, is cognizant of economic pressure. Since the Wuhan lockdown, authorities have tellingly steered clear of shutting down economically significant cities like Beijing despite substantial flareups. Officials turned largely to aggressive contact-tracing during an outbreak in the capital last summer. \n\u201cEffective as lockdowns are, they are costly,\u201d said Yanzhong Huang, Director of the Center for Global Health Studies at New Jersey\u2019s Seton Hall University. \u201cEven for China, it\u2019s unsustainable in the long term,\u201d he added, likening reflexive lockdown decisions to \u201cshooting cannonballs at mosquitoes.\u201d \nWith vaccinations drives now being rapidly rolled out across major western countries and China, the hope is that lockdowns will be far less common in 2021, though substantial uncertainty remains over how long it\u2019ll take to vaccinate enough of the world population to safely re-open the global economy. \nDespite the economic implications, COVID-19\u2019s legacy is likely that lockdowns will continue to be deployed during outbreaks of highly communicable diseases in the future, especially since they\u2019re now a familiar concept to people everywhere for the first time in a century. \n\u201cRestrictive quarantine itself is not a new invention and its application dates back to the Black Death in the medieval times,\u201d said Huang. \u201cBut it\u2019s ironic that such an old method remains the most effective despite the tremendous progress in medical sciences.\u201d \nA woman is reflected in a shop window in Lisbon on Friday as Portugal entered a fresh lockdown over a surge in coronavirus cases. | AFP-JIJI\n \nAn empty street in Yueyang, Hunan province, in January last year, amid the partial lockdown of neighboring Hubei province | REUTERS\n\nIn a time of both misinformation and too much information, quality journalism is more crucial than ever.

Errors may exist due to this process.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t \nThe great importance of vacations for all those who work is proven. However, there is a sector that, due to the obligations that their work implies, puts them aside, not without suffering the consequences of that decision: entrepreneurs . \nWhen you work as an employee you know that every month you will receive your salary, because you signed a contract. Something similar happens with the holidays that will arrive at a certain time. However, for people who create their own businesses the situation is different; They are always busy and cannot put their obligations aside, because much of their functioning depends on it. \nWhat many do not know is that in addition to rest, vacations represent the period where creativity most flourishes. On the contrary, without them, you can make bad decisions, creativity is blocked and you end up seeing everything fuzzy. \nTo make things easier for you, here are some activities that don\u2019t take as much time and that will allow you to rest without leaving your business. Take note and relax !: \nRead a good book Not another about marketing or leadership, but a fictional one that takes you out of this world. It can be something from authors like Ken Follet or Stieg Larsson for example or one from the Harry Potter saga or The Lord of the Rings, if you are a fan. Anything that motivates your imagination and makes you have a good time. \nGo to a coffee shop In those places you can meet and meet interesting people. Prefer a local coffee shop, something closer than the big chains where you will meet executives. \nGo to the cinema You can choose any time, at two in the afternoon for example there are less people. Choose the afternoon when you have fewer scheduled activities and watch a good movie that distracts you. \nEnjoy a hobby Play a musical instrument, play golf, tennis, or learn gardening, whatever you like. You can also play board or brain games, or do puzzles. \nRelax in a spa Take a massage and relax for an entire afternoon. Give yourself even an hour just for you and pamper yourself, it will help you improve your performance and keep you motivated. \nGet together with friends Take advantage of these meetings to talk about something other than business. You can also choose a fun living room game, the idea is to laugh and forget even a time from work. \nSpend time with your family If you have children, take time to play and have fun with them. Make an appointment with your partner and ensure that, while you are with your family, you do not answer calls from work or check your mail. Giving them quality time will work for you too. \ndo exercise Set aside at least half an hour a day to exercise. You can run in the park or maybe go to a gym, the point is that you stay healthy and fit. This will help you not only improve your health, but also your mood, your self-esteem and also to get rid of negative energy. \n \n \n \n Source link  \nThe post Are You Feeling Very Stressed?

                "title": "A New Tool To Facilitate Quicker, Error-Free Software Design",
                "text": "Any building project requires the formulation of a series of\u00a0initial plans\u00a0prior to starting construction to serve as a basis and guide for the whole process. A similar procedure is followed in\u00a0software\u00a0development, with the inclusion of a specific step known as\u00a0modelling.  \n\n\n\n\"The process is equivalent to the production of a set of plans for a building before its construction,\" explained Universitat Oberta de Catalunya (UOC) Faculty of\u00a0Computer Science, Multimedia and Telecommunications\u00a0professor and member of the\u00a0SOM Research Lab\u00a0research group -from the Internet Interdisciplinary Institute (IN3)-,\u00a0Robert Claris\u00f3. \n\n\n\nEngineers use modelling to describe a software system from a specific perspective, such as the data it will use, its components or the way they expect it to function. Going back to the building project example, the plans would be the\u00a0'models', which can be used\u00a0for guidance during the development stage,\u00a0as well as for carrying out simulations and tests. \n\n\n\nAccording to the researcher, \"The model type most frequently used is the UML (Unified Modelling Language) class diagram notation, which is used to describe the structure of a software system.\"  \n\n\n\nThe advantage of working with these models is that\u00a0they are more abstract than source code, which contains a lot of specific details about the technology being used.  \n\n\n\nIn the words of Claris\u00f3, \"Models can be more concise,\u00a0easier to produce\u00a0and understand.\" \n\n\n\nAs such, modelling would serve more as a\u00a0preliminary step\u00a0rather than an alternative to source code. The models make it easier to understand the system being developed and can also be used to generate certain implementation elements,\u00a0automating the most repetitive parts\u00a0of the programming process. \n\n\n\nThe role of verification tools\n\n\n\nEngineers use\u00a0verification tools\u00a0to prevent errors that could affect the code itself and, therefore, the final implementation of the system. Emphasizing the importance of this process, Claris\u00f3 said, \"We need to ensure the models are correct in order to\u00a0minimize possible errors\u00a0in the software that could occur as a result.\" \n\n\n\nAs part of a study\u00a0published in the\u00a0Journal of Object Technology,\u00a0Claris\u00f3, along with his colleagues, Carlos A. Gonz\u00e1lez (Gran Telescopio Canarias researcher) and Jordi Cabot (ICREA researcher), has come up with a new verification technique for UML/OCL models that\u00a0solves a common problem. Every time a designer makes a change \u2013 such as adding, deleting, or modifying information \u2013 to the model it means that\u00a0the whole system has to be re-analysed, which is the why verification is usually only carried out once a definitive model has been produced at the end of the process. \n\n\n\nAs Claris\u00f3 explained, \"Our article outlines the application of\u00a0incremental methods of verification, that is, we make it easier to verify a model any time changes are made.\"  \n\n\n\nRather than only being able to verify the model at the end of the process, as is currently the case, this permits it to be verified\u00a0during construction, without having to start from scratch, which facilitates the\u00a0early detection of errors. \n\n\n\nAn active community, both nationally and globally\n\n\n\nThis method is also innovative with regard to its use of\u00a0certificates, the examples that illustrate the correct operation of the model. As the researcher pointed out, \"When we modify a model, having a new certificate would\u00a0remove the need for its verification. \n\n\n\nIt's far less costly to adapt a certificate than it is to\u00a0rerun the verification process.\" Explaining the process, the authors propose that, rather than verifying the new model, a certificate from the original model could be adapted to the new one. The biggest challenge they now face is\u00a0integrating these techniques\u00a0into existing software modelling tools and environments. \n\n\n\nCommenting on the sector in general, Claris\u00f3, who acted as the coordinator of the\u00a0Spanish Network of Excellence in Model-driven Software Engineering\u00a0, stressed that, \"the Spanish modelling community is still very active and participates in a variety of\u00a0national and international research projects\". \n\n\n\nIn fact, although the network is no longer operational, the\u00a0community still works together and collaborates as part of the annual Software and Database Engineering Conference, which has a space dedicated to Model-driven Software Engineering. \n\n\n\nThis study is part of the \"MegaM@Rt2: MegaModelling at Run-time\" (2020 ECSEL Joint Undertaking Project, 737494) European project and the \"Open Data for All: an API-based infrastructure for exploiting online data sources\" (TIN2016- 75944-R) national project funded under the Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation's National R&D&I Plan. \nThe article A New Tool To Facilitate Quicker, Error-Free Software Design appeared first on Eurasia Review.",

                "title": "This Day, January 18, In Jewish History by Mitchell A and Deb Levin Z\"L",
                "text": "January 18  360: In a move that demonstrated how Christianity was becoming the state religion of the Roman Empire with all that meant to detriment of the Jews, Roman Emperor Constantius II \u201cdecreed that only Catholic Churches will be granted exemptions from state taxes.\u201d  532: In Constantinople, the Nika riots come to an end with Justinian still holding the office of Emperor.\u00a0 Senators opposed to Justinian took advantage of these riots, which had grown out of a dispute over chariot competition, to try and bring an end to Justinian\u2019s imperial rule. Justinian was ready to flee the city and effectively give up his power.\u00a0 However, his wife refused to leave and give him the courage to stay and defeat the mob and his enemies.\u00a0 History does not record the views held by Justinian\u2019s opponents concerning the Jewish people and Judaism.\u00a0 But it does not seem possible that the Jews could have been any worse off if they had won given Justinian\u2019s anti-Jewish policies.\u00a0 For example, \u201cJustinian ruled that \u2018Jews must never enjoy the furits of office, but only its pains and penalties\u2026They shall enjoy no honors.\u00a0 Their status shall reflect the baseness which in their souls they have elected and desired.\u2019\u201d Justinian firmly established the principle of servitus Jadaeorum (servitude of the Jews) and \u201cthe hitherto uneven pattern of persecution was systematized\u201d as Christianity and state power became synonymous.   746: Beginning of a three-year period of major earthquakes in Palestine, the focus of which were \u201cin the Judean desert, the rift valley, Jordan Valley and Jerusalem.\u201d (As reported by Jewshihistory.org)  749:\u00a0 According to Michael the Syrian, several ships were sunk off the coast of Palestine and Lebanon as the result of an earthquake.  973: A year after a fire raged through Baghdad \u201cthat contributed to the decline of the city\u2019s Jewish population and its importance in the Jewish world\u201d Benedict VI, a contemporary of Ibrahim Ibn Ya\u2019kub, began his papacy today.  1074: \u201cHenry IV granted the citizens and Jews of Worms, the ShUM-cities and other locations, including Frankfurt, certain privileges relating to reductions in fees and import duties.\u201d  1174: Bernard, the third child of Burgundian nobles Tescelin de Fontaine, lord of Fontaine-l\u00e8s-Dijon, and Al\u00e8the de Montbard, who became the Abbot of Clairvaux and was known as Bernard of Clairvaux, the Benedictine who \u201ccondemned violence against Jewish people\u201d was \u201ccanonized by Pope Alexander III\u201d today.  1562:\u00a0 The Council of Trent reconvenes after a ten-year break.\u00a0 The Council of Trent adopted additional books for inclusion in the Old Testament. This meant that the TaNaCh (the Hebrew Bible, or simply The Bible) and Old Testament of the Christian Bible were no longer the same texts.\u00a0 A discussion of the implications of this change is far beyond the scope of this daily summary.\u00a0   1606: The Governor of Puerto Rico reported one-fifth of the white population of the island was Portuguese. It was said these \"white\" Portuguese persons were most likely conversos.  1689: Birthdate of Charles de Montesquieu the French born political theorist who was uncharacteristically critical of the Jews in Lettres Persanes when he wrote \u201cKnow that wherever there is money, there are Jews.\u00a0 Thou inquires what they do here?\u00a0 Just what they do in Persia; nothing can be more like a Jew of Asia than a Jew of Europe.\u201d In the same book he also wrote that \u201cthe People of the Book\u201d was \u201ca mother that has brought forth two daughters who have stabbed her with a thousand wounds.\u201d (As reported by Elliot Rosenberg)  1701: At K\u00f6nigsberg, Prussia, coronation of Fredrick I who in 1709 appointed Aaron ben Benjamin Wolf \u201cto the office of chief rabbi of Berlin with jurisdiction over all the living in the mark.\u201d  1724: Judah Monis, the Italian born Rabbi who converted to obtain a teaching position at Harvard married Abbigal Maret, the sister-in-law of Reverend John Martyn of Northboro, MA, at the First Church in Cambridge  1724: Pope Innocent XIII published Ex Injuncto Nobis a bull that \u201cforbade Jews from selling new objects\u201d which \u201cwas similar to the bull published by Clement VIII in 1592, and which was meant to put Jewish merchants at a disadvantage.\u201d  1776: Birthdate of Lazarus Magnus, the native of Zwolle, Holland, the husband of Sara Moses with whom he had 13 children at they settled in Chatham, Kent, UK.   1777)10thof Shevat, 5537): Parashat Bo  1777 (10th of Shevat, 5537): Rabbi Shalom Sharabi, known by his name's acronym, the RaShaSH, passed away. He was born in Yemen, and as a young man immigrated to Israel. He was quickly recognized for his piety and scholarship, especially in the area of Jewish mysticism, and was appointed to be dean of the famed Kabalistic learning center in the Old City of Jerusalem, the Yeshivat ha-Mekubbalim. He authored many works, mostly based on the teachings of the great kabbalist, Rabbi Isaac Luria, the Ari. Rabbi Sharabi's most famous work is a commentary on the prayer book, replete with kabalistic meditations. His mystical works are studied by Kabbalists to this very day. He is also considered to be a foremost authority on Yemenite Jewish traditions and customs.   http://www.aish.com/dijh/Shevat_10.html  https://www.chabad.org/kabbalah/article_cdo/aid/2444216/jewish/Rabbi-Shalom-Sharabi-The-Rashash.htm  1782:\u00a0 Birthdate of American political leader, statesmen and orator Daniel Webster.\u00a0 In 1850, Webster was Secretary of State under President Fillmore. He and his political opponent Senator Henry Clay joined forces to defeat a treaty with the Swiss that would have discriminated against American Jews.\u00a0 The issue was one of religious freedom, and not an attempt to protect American Jews since the American government was working to remove disabilities faced by Protestant Americans doing business with Catholic countries.  1784 Beile and Moses Wolf Levy Heller gave birth to Meiline Heller, the wife of Akiva Muhlhauser with whom she had had seven children.  1788: Leading elements of the First Fleet carrying 736 convicts from England to Australia arrives at Botany Bay.\u00a0 According to Dr. Raymond Apple, Emeritus Rabbi of The Great Synagogue in Sydney, \u201cWhen New South Wales was founded as a penal colony in 1788; among the 751 First Fleet convicts were at least 16 Jews.\u201d  1794: In Georgetown, SC, Belle Moses and Solomon Cohen gave birth to Isaac Cohen.  1794: Birthdate of Daniel Lessman, the native of Soldin Neumark who interrupted his medical studies so he could fight against Napoleon and gained fame as a German historian and poet.  1795: In Bavaria, Comednal Moses and Aaron Cohen gave birth to Deborah Cohen, the wife of Solomon Stix with whom she had ten children.  1796: According to one source today, in Maryland Rachel Gratz and Solomon Etting gave birth to Samuel Etting, the husband of Ellen Hays and the father of Josephine and Solomon Etting.   1798: In Devon, England, Annie Ezekiel and Benjamin Jonas gave birth to \u201cBaruh Jonas, the husband of Teresa Barbarin whom he married in New Orleans.  1798: Birthdate of French native Esther Scheyen, the wife of Marc Levy and the mother of Samuel Levy.  1800(21stof Tevet, 5560): Parashat Shemot  1804: Israel B.

Justinian was ready to flee the city and effectively give up his power.\u00a0 However, his wife refused to leave and give him the courage to stay and defeat the mob and his enemies.\u00a0 History does not record the views held by Justinian\u2019s opponents concerning the Jewish people and Judaism.\u00a0 But it does not seem possible that the Jews could have been any worse off if they had won given Justinian\u2019s anti-Jewish policies.\u00a0 For example, \u201cJustinian ruled that \u2018Jews must never enjoy the furits of office, but only its pains and penalties\u2026They shall enjoy no honors.\u00a0 Their status shall reflect the baseness which in their souls they have elected and desired.\u2019\u201d Justinian firmly established the principle of servitus Jadaeorum (servitude of the Jews) and \u201cthe hitherto uneven pattern of persecution was systematized\u201d as Christianity and state power became synonymous.   746: Beginning of a three-year period of major earthquakes in Palestine, the focus of which were \u201cin the Judean desert, the rift valley, Jordan Valley and Jerusalem.\u201d (As reported by Jewshihistory.org)  749:\u00a0 According to Michael the Syrian, several ships were sunk off the coast of Palestine and Lebanon as the result of an earthquake.  973: A year after a fire raged through Baghdad \u201cthat contributed to the decline of the city\u2019s Jewish population and its importance in the Jewish world\u201d Benedict VI, a contemporary of Ibrahim Ibn Ya\u2019kub, began his papacy today.  1074: \u201cHenry IV granted the citizens and Jews of Worms, the ShUM-cities and other locations, including Frankfurt, certain privileges relating to reductions in fees and import duties.\u201d  1174: Bernard, the third child of Burgundian nobles Tescelin de Fontaine, lord of Fontaine-l\u00e8s-Dijon, and Al\u00e8the de Montbard, who became the Abbot of Clairvaux and was known as Bernard of Clairvaux, the Benedictine who \u201ccondemned violence against Jewish people\u201d was \u201ccanonized by Pope Alexander III\u201d today.  1562:\u00a0 The Council of Trent reconvenes after a ten-year break.\u00a0 The Council of Trent adopted additional books for inclusion in the Old Testament.

                "text": "I picked the header picture based upon what should have been. In years past, during the first  two weeks of January, I have typically been flying to San Diego, Bonita Springs, Austin or even Tucson for this event. This year the only flying to be done was my fingers across a keyboard (but I am not sure that would have been any different rather I was in some distant locale or sitting in my office. I will say that trying to do this annual exercise of note taking while not actually being in the room lacks some distinct ambiance and certainly leaves something to be preferred in networking with others.  That being said, here is the normal disclaimer: I am 100% sure that a few spelling and grammatical errors will be found. Please remember that these are raw, rapidly taken notes with a few pictures thrown in. The point here is to disseminate the great work being done by NAEMSP that I feel should be one of our top sources for change in EMS. Without any further delay, the notes:  Day One:  NAEMSP Welcome & Opening Remarks (David Tan): Welcome to the 2021 National Meeting of the NAEMSP. Speaker has noticed the extreme dedication of EMS during the events of this past year. 2022 will be a fabulous reunion when we can all meet again in person in San Diego. We had great plans for 2020 but those plans were hijacked by COVID. What did NAEMSP do in 2020? Townhall meetings were held on COVID with sample protocols and best practices. NAEMSP worked to assure that EMS emergency medications were included in the act to allow better access during COVID. NAEMSP continues to engage stakeholders in advocacy and the NAEMSP political action committee. The 2021 NAEMSP textbook was updated. Quality medical oversight is an essential facet of prehospital emergency care. NAEMSP position papers and the width and depth of the organization continues to solve problems.    NAEMSP Keynote Address: Compassion in Action - Resilient Leadership in Uncertain Times (Chetan Kharod, MD \u2013 Department of Defense): Speaker is a leader in first response resiliency. Tells the story of being a mid-level residence. Took care of a patient he shall call Mrs. H. Patient had pneumonia. Facility was busy. Patient needed respiratory support, antibiotics and breathing treatments. He checked on her between patients and found her weeping. He walked in and asked what she was needed. He sat down, because if you sit down, they know you are there. She asked for something so that she would never wake up again. He told her he could not. He wiped her head and told her they would help her. He was chastised for sitting with her. The next morning, he remembered he said he would check on her. He went back to hospital and checked on her and found she now considered him to be her doctor (she was telling the attending she wanted to see him). She smiled. The physician who chastised him later apologized as he realized this was proper care. \u201cMy life is My Message\u201d was quoted. Is compassion a weak or a strong choice? Veneer theory or biologic basis for kindness? Is Lord of the Flies inevitable for Man? He submits\u2026 absolutely not! Animals live together as do humans. Survival is possible together. In being alone is great danger. When you see bad behavior or anger, use the phrase, \u201cJust like me,\u201d as in, \u201cJust like me, that person may be in a hurry.\u201d There are perils in social isolation. We are all part of something greater. In EMS, we are aware that we are a part of something greater. We get it. We are dialed in that humans are more important than hardware. Take an item you have. How did you get it? It represents a chain of interdependence. We are incredibly interconnected. There is connectedness whether you note it or not. Self-cultivation is different from being selfish or self-interested. To care for others we have to care for ourselves. You cannot fill the cup of others if yours is empty. Ripple effect affects us. Ripples help transform us for population impact of those in need. Mrs. H was a drop that created a ripple that is still with him today. The ripple continues because it is shared. Leaders set the tone. Leaders have the superpower of emotional contagion. We must be aware of the power we have. Kindness is contagious. It is as simple as holding a door open. Recipients of kindness are more likely to carry on the kindness. One act becomes five, becomes twenty-five becomes one hundred and twenty-five. Do not confuse faith that you will prevail with the discipline to confront the most brutal facts of your current reality. Quotes the Stockdale Paradox. \u201cAs we seek, so shall we find.\u201d The speaker is a Scoutmaster as well. He talks to scouts about the boiling water story. If the challenges of life are boiling water we have three approaches. We can be carrots and become soft and squishy in the boiling water. Or we can be eggs and harden up in the boiling water. Or we can become coffee and turn into something wonderful in the boiling water. Coffee is like smelling hope. Become coffee. Hope is a key. He treated Mrs. H with hope. He told her she would have help getting through her medical issue. Superman was a symbol of hope. Leaders are a symbol of hope. Leadership in uncertain times: Pre-plan, stay sharp, maintain perspective, stay connected, be present, have and give hope and be compassionate. Compassion is strength. Progress is more important than perfection. We will not be perfect every day. Resiliency = individual + team + system. Combine today\u2019s action with tomorrow\u2019s hope. \u201cIt is not enough to be compassionate; we must act.\u201d Our life is our message. He talked about his first military deployment and wondering when it would normalize. Wishing for it to go back to normal does make it happen fast. Be with the ones you are beside. Put a hand on a shoulder. Discuss things that were hard. It is OK to have a bad day. Acknowledge limitations.  NAEMSP Navigating Drug Shortages, Improving Patient Safety, and Reducing Waste (Clayton Kazan \u2013 LA Fire Department): December of 2015, the pharmacy notified the fire department that they would not supply controlled substances any longer. Board of pharmacy was taking action against medical director\u2019s personal licenses. The whole process had to change. He covered the existing process which was intense and complicated. Multiple form processes. Could take up to ten days for restock. Some patients were not getting Morphine because medics were conserving due to length of time to replace. Only the worst pain was being treated. This led to overstocking. In contrast, pharmacies use electronic records, auto-dispensing and stock rotation to prevent waste. Fire stations were not allowed to have dispensing systems by law. The law was changed. Pyxis machines were placed as a solution. The DEA regulations caused confusion with who and where needed licensing. The fire department did all that was needed to be compliant. Dr. Craig Manifold was crucial in working with the Access to Emergency Medication Act of 2017. Covered the system of how the monitor the distribution machines. They have remote monitoring of the stations as well. One machine per battalion. All restocks are compared against the EPCR. Biometric ID is required by both members of the crew for restock. Waste is double signed. Now at 3.5 years and over 20,000 transactions there have only been three vials of Morphine missing. Utilization with patients has increased as now there is no fear of delayed resupply. This caused them to look at other medications. Epi went on shortage. Found EMS was a low priority on distribution when receiving meds from hospitals. They were moving to using Epi as a push dose pressor which increased supply need. They centralized ordering for Epi. Stations started reporting stock and expiration dates. Reduced Epi usage on arrest patients (no benefit beyond 3mg). EPCR data was used to determine needed PAR stocking levels. Ordered through hospital but formed relationships with distributors and manufacturers. End result? They maintained stock when many were out. The epiphany: It showed them how to navigate other shortages. They started to look at all medication stock in the same way. Stations have four-month stock of predicted utilization (California is rated as the worst state for disasters by FEMA). Monthly distribution is utilized. Expired meds are returned. Waste has been drastically reduced which saved a lot of money. They were spending $900,000 annually and wasting $300,000. Now it is at $700,000 with waste at around $100,000. What about drug safety? EMS is a major healthcare organization. They no longer take preloads out of the box. This should not happen. They are boxed for protection from light. Regulatory requirements on storing medications matter. Medication is a core part of the EMS mission. Pharmacists must be a part of your processes. Medical directors are not necessarily trained on what a pharmacist does for a living. Pharmacy training really does not mention EMS. Cross education is a must. There is much return on investment on improving the education and the process. Better compliance, access and security are a result. EZ IO needles are treated as drugs in stock control. Drug shortages are managed. Waste and costs are managed. They would love to share their process with others.   NAEMSP Peer Review for the Medical Literature: How to Help Our Journal (PEC) Grow and Thrive (David Cone, MD) \u2013Editor in chief is changing for the first time in twenty-five years. Why are peer reviews needed? Assess intrinsic value and assesses controversial opinion. It should detect poor study design, flaws of logic, bad science, math errors and erroneous or overstated conclusions. Three options: accept without review, reject without review or send out for peer review. Two thirds of articles go out for peer review. Reviewers are selected by screeners (generally 3 or 4). May also use a specialized reviewer. Manuscripts are blinded. Most do not reveal the authors to the reviewers. Journal publication schedules are tight. If you commit to a review, get it in on time. How to read: Read it three times. One study recommends four hours for review. Use a peer review template. Initial impressions? Does the paper pass the \u201cso what?\u201d test? Conflicts of interest? Look at each section. Mark up the manuscript. Don\u2019t write the review yet. Determine which references to review. Is it clear why the study was done? Is the study question clearly stated? Reproducible? Techniques understandable? Setting explained? Are the statistics reasonable? What analytic methods were used? Do data and results match the methods. Are the results in context? Is the relevance and importance made clear without being over-stated? Does the paper wander off topic? Are limitations missing or under-stated? Figures and tables helpful or fluff? References up to date? Are important references meeting? Grammar, spelling, syntax good? Originality? Validity must be assessed. Discussed the importance of the three readings. Start writing the review. Write a review for the editor and one for the authors. Tell the editor what you really think. Include specific concern comments. What happens next? Editor considers reviews and makes a disposition decision. Decision letters are sent to the authors with either specific or consensus reviews. The editor may be called for advice. Revisions may be handled by the editor. May be re-sent to reviewers. May use new reviewers for revision reviews. Examine the published article against your review.   NAEMSP Building a Relationship with the Medics: The Medical Director Belongs in the Field (Jason Pickett, MD, FACEP and Selena Xie, President Austin EMS Association \u2013 Austin, TX) - Building a relationship with the medics and the workforce is a must. Will discuss perils and pitfalls. The medical director is often seen as scary. This is true of the ER physician as well. Even the smallest comments can be taken as tearing them down instead of support. This view can set the medical director and the relationship up for failure. They must get to know the medical director and feel comfortable asking questions. The medics need to know the medical director knows what they are talking about. There is a real need for the physician medical director to build street cred. The medical director must inspire them to do what is needed and they must know why it is important. Otherwise, they will find ways not to do it. If you add to their burdens they must know why. You must be in their environment or you will be perceived of not understanding their world. Caregivers must believe in medical practice changes and a great relationship helps that adoption. Nothing sabotages future initiatives like a failed initiative. The medical director must identify and understand pitfalls in implementing a new procedure. The medical director needs to gain an intimate understanding of special operations. That understanding is not gained outside of the environment. Equipment is no good without know how. Being out there gives the physician a knowledge of the austere environment where EMS lives. Being out there allows for bedside teaching. We want to instill physician mindset in paramedics in the field and that is done at the bedside. The medical director must create excitement about the care and about changes. When they ask you a question they are thinking about the medicine. Medical errors and near misses must have frank conversations that foster learning, not fear. Process improvement must have a medical director component and involvement and for this to occur, the physician must understand the technique and the environment. Documentation alone cannot cover everything that occurs on an emergency scene. Previous observation helps fill in those gaps. The medical director is a brand, and you have to build that brand. Being aloof from the medics is a bad thing and you will be scene negatively. The physician speaker prefers to be addressed by first name by the paramedics. The rank of physician serves as a barrier to interaction and transparency in the situation. Messaging can be used as well between the medical director and the workforce. Joint messaging between the MD, the caregivers and the EMS organization has proven very beneficial. A pitfall of increased involvement is familiarity. Familiarity may also breed problems with objective review. You must be aware of bias. The medical director should not blur the lines of operational vs. medical authority. We all have to stay in our lanes. Good medicine is sometimes bad tactics. Pick your battles wisely. You will see things that need to be addressed. Pick the ones that are yours as a medical director own. \u201cIf you\u2019re an asshole, it does more harm than good.\u201d Field time is fun. It can get you back to your roots as a medical director. Medics feel excitement and pride at seeing their medical director in the field. Great presentation.  NAEMSP Learning in Place: Overcoming the Obsolescence of Our Initial Education (Scott Bourn, PhD): A few questions? Ponder this. Look at your own practice. Have you had a patient with a disease you never heard of? A toxin? Asked advice about something you did not know existed? Then you are confused just like others on occasion. Speaker had to learn how to be a clinical resource. Initial education only prepared him for the field, not being a resource. Everything he needed to know WAS NOT learned in Kindergarten. Knowledge expires the day after graduation. That is dismaying but true. Why? The world changes. Our role in the world changes. We are really good at some stuff and not really good at other things. We gravitate toward what we are good at. Data influences what we need to know and modify. Data drives personalization. After initial education we have to utilize data to leverage our function. We have to cultivate a new attitude when change is required. We must know that we don\u2019t know everything we need to know. \u201cMastery begins with humility.\u201d We have to learn from failure. When bad things happen make it an obligation to teach and create to keep the bad thing from happening again. We can run from failure or embrace it and use it to grow. Seek and understand the data. Learn leadership and know the data from the clinical practice you lead. Know the data and know it very well. We must analyze the actionable area between literature and operational data. We must build on our strengths. Recognize opportunities to serve where you are strong. Things we are really good at are things were learned faster. Stick to your strengths. Don\u2019t stay in your lane, it is too comfortable. We do not perform at true potential when we are bored. Seek certification to truly know something. Getting out of your lane broadens your impact. You can grow by going back to school or other routes of self-education and immersion. Continual education is hard work. Sometimes it is obvious that we have to learn more very fast to survive in the role we have joined. Remember, what we do is a privilege. Keep refreshing your expiration date.   NAEMSP Community Response and Drone Technology to Improve Outcomes from Rural and remote Cardiac Arrest: The Future is Now! (Cheskes, MD and Snobelen, Paramedic Services Specialist): Public Access Defib has a tremendous impact on survival. There is a solution to get these programs to rural and remote operations. Every second counts in cardiac arrest survival. Urban response times are short. Bystander CPR rates are around 40%. Many places are less than 20%. An AED can still make a big difference. They are simple and easy to use. Many times, an AED is not applied in the public. Patients will say they were lucky because someone did CPR and there was an AED. This outcome should not be luck. Some places are difficult to get to, in fact most of America is this way. Drones can affect this. We have to connect those willing to the patient and the tools. The PulsePoint application serves to connect those willing to CPR with the arrest patient and in many cases an AED. Peel Regional Paramedic Services created a volunteer unit that reports to paramedic services. They are given a response kit. The kit has an AED and associated supplies for cardiac arrest. After the arrest they follow up with the bystander. They also capture the rhythms off the AED. Another option is the drone program. This is considered private access AED. There are many uses for drones. There has been an increase in medical usage drones. They are using Beyond Visual Line of Sight drones. They believe 90% AED arrival in a rural setting of between 10 and 11 minutes is feasible. The program has reached national media attention in Canada. Video was shown of a simulated response. In most cases the drone arrived faster than the ambulance by about three minutes in simulation. Some feasibility flights covered nearly 9km. Surveys showed that the rural populace knew what a drone was but were not familiar with the AED. Delivering an AED without instructions on how and when to use does not meet the goal. AED drops practiced from the drone. Used Facetime App to deliver instructions (smartphone attached to the AED). Some simulations now up to 50km. Illumination added to the AED for night drops. They keep testing new things.    NAEMSP Development of a Sustainable Payment Model for Alternative Destinations (Medero, MD, Smith, MPA and Kasper): Large service area in Albuquerque. Three acute Care hospital ED\u2019s. Do we really need to go to the emergency department with our patients? Greater than 50% of calls are low acuity. ED overcrowding leads delays in receiving care. Goal is to meet IHI Triple Aim (my note: as it should be for all EMS agencies). Use of ETHAN for telemedicine was assessed. Data showing time and cost savings using alternative destinations. Legal review must be a component. What is the capacity for care of the alternative destination? It must be able to address the patient\u2019s needs. Assess what is needed to move forward and act. Using Uber Health as well. No billing/reimbursement path exists today. Financial modeling was used to determine financial impact. Payer sources wanted to see proof of concept before agreeing to participate. Patients were surveyed as to whether they would utilize an alternative destination during a 911 call. Many patients said yes. Many said they would prefer an urgent care over the ED. The payer mix in the survey matched what was seen in normal EMS transport. The cost of using Uber Health to go to ED instead of ambulance to ED was about a savings of $3,400 per patient. State laws differ on the availability to deliver alternative destination care. There is no direct billing code for this service with many payer sources in NM. Many are on managed care plans. There were a lot of challenges in billing and coding restraints. Meetings and research were prolific. There were challenges with physician billing for the telemedicine piece as well. Luckily, everyone wants to see this program work.   NAEMSP Oral Abstracts (1 \u2013 6):   1.\u200e Bougie-Assisted Endotracheal Intubation in the Pragmatic Airway Resuscitation Trial: Airway is an important role in resuscitation. Intubation is difficult with pitfalls. The bougie is a semi-rigid tool for airway insertion. Associated with greater first pass success. Post-hoc analysis of PART on ETI patients. Bougie use was paramedic discretion. Analyzed success and survival at 72 hours. N=1,227 patients. First pass success was not significantly different with or without bougie. Intubation was faster without bougie. No difference in 72 hour survival between both groups. Overall survival was lower in the bougie group. Not a randomized trial. Baseline ETI success rate in the overall trial was low. Findings neither support or refute bougie use. ROC study.   \u200e2.\u200e Effect of Airway Strategy Upon Chest Compression Quality in the Pragmatic Airway Resuscitation Trial: High quality CPR improves arrest outcomes. Airway management may alter chest compression quality. Supraglottic airways may not conflict with compressions. PART study data was used. Better outcomes with supraglottic airways than with intubation. Used CPR waveform analysis from the ECG monitor for compression delays and compression quality. Interruption was defined as a pause for longer than 3 seconds. Examined differences in cases with pauses and with multiple airway attempts. N=1,996. Duration of resuscitation was 3 minutes longer with ETI. Duration and number of interruptions were similar between airway devices, but durations were longer with ETI. Interruptions were shorter with BVM only airway management. This study supports other studies. ROC study. Airway management can influence chest compressions. Airway DOES matter in cardiac arrest. Supraglottic airway use has shorter compression interruptions.   \u200e3.\u200e Measuring the Overuse of Helicopter Air Ambulances for Transport of Trauma Patients: Why does helicopter transport matter? Costly. Risk: 3.62 accidents per 100,00 hours of flight time in 2018. We know that for short distances ground transport is better. For long distances, air transport is better. Strong benefit of air to trauma outcomes. Retrospective analysis using ESO data. Trauma activation criteria used in the study. N=5,984 transported by helicopter EMS. Median age = 44. Over 69% of patients were male. 57% of those transported did not meet trauma center activation. 52% were rural. 17% were super-rural. REMS used for acuity measurement. Over half had no documented trauma activation criteria. Urban setting transports presented no time savings.   \u200e4.\u200e Incidence and Factors Associated with Post-intubation Cardiac Arrest in the Prehospital Setting: Case study presented on the topic. Patient arrested during intubation. Associated factors identified and are multiple. Include obesity, Succinylcholine and others. N=37 patients. All had cardiac arrest within 20 minutes of intubation. COPD was a common factor. Hypotension was also noted as a common factor. 45.9% had IV fluids prior to intubation. 19 received neuromuscular blockade. ROSC was 54.1%. Hypoxemia and hypotension, shock index and RSI were all factors. Important to note that over 50% were normotensive. Dosages were standard for RSI medications. There is no comparison group and small sample size. One EMS organization was used. PICA is due to multiple factors. Resuscitate before you intubate. More studies needed.   \u200e5.\u200e Applying a Set of Termination of Resuscitation Criteria to Pediatric Out-of-hospital Cardiac Arrest: OHCA in children incidence is low. Survival has improved but rate is still low and neuro outcomes need improvement. TOR criteria is primarily prevalent in adult patients and rare for Peds. Adult studies have shown TOR criteria is applicable to adult patients. pTOR criteria is needed. Retrospective observational study. Study looked at 0-17 age patients. pTOR criteria was applied looking at minimum scene times, amount of Epi and ETCO2 readings. If minimum scene time increased from 10 to 20 minutes PPV was increased to 92.9% with better sensitivity and specificity. Medical pTOR criteria performed far better than Trauma pTOR. ROSC was a proxy for survival in the study. Overall outcomes were not assessed.   \u200e6.\u200e Bougie through i-gel\u00ae Technique for Endotracheal Intubation on Cadavers: Technique of insertion discussed. Procedure taught in cadaver lab. Can be used as a blind intubation technique. Hypothesis was that first pass success of this technique would be 70%. Complicated airway was simulated with a cervical collar. 51 paramedics participated in the trial. Combined first pass success was 69%. 73% with bougie. Technique is slow due to multiple steps. Further research needed. Technique has similar success rate to other methods.   NAEMSP ON DEMAND SESSION \u2013 10 Ways to Die on a Farm: Medical Control Considerations for EMS Medical Directors (Ashley Huff, MD): The farm is the deadliest workplace. 1) Grain bin accidents. In last 50 years over 900 cases of grain engulfment have been reported with a fatality rate of 62%. In 2010, there were 26 fatalities. Grain bridges (caps) collapse and surround and suffocate the farm worker by surrounding the chest. Anticipate crush injury and inhalation of grain dust. Special training needed for rescue. 2)There are also explosions in grain elevators. 3) Auger entrapment: Augers trap farmers and children who live and work on the farm. They cause significant horrific injuries. These are prolonged extrications with need for tourniquets and junctional tourniquets. Amputation may be needed. 4) Power Take Offs: Covers are taken off to speed up use or for maintenance. Clothing is then caught and pulls victim in. Normal reaction time is not enough to escape. Victim is spun around the PTO. 5) Tractor Rollovers: 1,700 died in tractor accidents between 2003 and 2013. The most common type was a rollover. This is a high fatality incident. Crush injuries and spinal cord injuries are common. Rollover protection systems are needed. 6) Front Loaders: Usually injuries are due to this vehicle being used for purposes that it was not intended for. Again, crush and spinal injuries common. 7) Sewage Slurry Pits: It is manure pit in or near livestock pins. Churning the manure creates toxic gasses like Hydrogen Sulfide and Methane. Inhalation can result in immediate collapse and this is highly fatal. When more than one person is down in a farm accident be highly suspicious of this. There are usually two victims before anyone realizes what is going on. 8) Chemical Spills: Anhydrous Ammonia causes bronchospasm and pulmonary toxicity. Large ETT and early tracheostomy may help with sloughed mucosa. 9) Livestock Attacks: Cows are most common during calving season. Veterinarians are commonly attacked. Crush injuries are most common due to trampling. Occurs with horses as well. 108 fatalities from cows between 2003 and 2007. 10) ATVs: Used commonly in agriculture. In 2013 alone there were 99,600 ATV-related emergency department treated injuries in the US. 25% were under 16 years of age. There were 13,043 ATV-related fatalities between 1982 and 2013. Most did not wear safety gear. Few had received any instruction on operation. Most drove them less than one day a week. Destinations: Not all EDs are equal. Rural EDs may transfer to trauma centers. Think about transfer times.   NAEMSP ON DEMAND SESSION \u2013 Top Articles of 2020 (Clemency, DO): Articles of importance from 2020 that may have impact on EMS for years to come.   1.  Epidemiological and Accounting Analysis of Ground Ambulance Whole Blood Transfusion - Whole blood was a pipe dream to most a few years ago. Since then, it has become more prevalent in the prehospital environment. Must be capable to have conversations about things that are being proposed. This was published in Prehospital and Disaster medicine and is on the financial implications. Looked at administrations in a few systems. 46% of administrations of whole blood were for non-trauma conditions. What is unique in this article is the math. It is always hard in EMS to balance impact with cost. It is rare to find attempts at calculation. Five calculations were used in this article: A) Projected EMS runs per whole blood administration = Average EMS runs per month / Average Whole blood administrations per month. B) TOTAL COSTS = Fixed costs + Variable Costsyear1 + Variable Costsyear2 + Variable Costsyearx. C) Average Costs = Total Costs / Total Administrations. D) Projected lives saved annually = Annual total whole blood administrations / Number Needed to Treat to save a life. E) Average cost of a life saved = Total Costs / Total projected lives save. Using these calculations, you could in theory insert any medication or procedure and determine cost per life saved (my note: like Naloxone? ITD? Lucas?). Used a demand forecast as well looking toward more use in future years. By year ten it was projected that he average cost of whole blood to save a life would be around $5,100. They used a monitor/defib and associated disposables was used for comparison at $1,700 per life saved over ten years. He notes that blood transfusion does not need to be as good as a monitor to still have benefit, but it does put the costs into perspective. The question is, what other things are we doing in EMS that would not pass this test? \u201cWhat wouldn\u2019t cut the mustard?\u201d   2. Ketamine Use in Prehospital and Hospital Treatment of the Acute Trauma Patient: A Joint Position Statement \u2013 This is a PEC article and contains a joint position statement from ACS, ACEP, NAEMSP, NASEMSO and NAEMT. At the end of the article, there are quite a few more organizations who signed off at the end including the American Academy of Pediatrics. The speaker encourages anyone using or thinking about using Ketamine in their system to dive into this position statement. Discusses indications but the document weighs heavily towards trauma. The speaker likes the fact that the statement used terms like \u201cpreferable\u201d and \u201cexcellent\u201d regarding Ketamine. The dosing section starts with admission that here is no standard dosing guideline available. The position statement uses dosages for Analgesia of 0.1-0.3 mg/kg (max 30mg) IV every 20 minutes PRN for a max of three doses (weight based) or 20 mg slow IV/IO push over 1 minute repeat every 20 minutes (non-weight based). For acute agitation or excited delirium: 3-5 mg/kg IM or 1-2 mg/kg IV. Side affects covered. Rapid IV bolus can cause transient apnea. Normal side effects covered as well. ETCO2 monitoring should be used. Emergence reactions believed to be rare and can be handled with benzodiazepines. Pre-medicating with benzodiazepines is not recommended. Most side effects are transient. Over sedation is usually seen in combination with benzodiazepines. Ketamine was once considered bad in head trauma, but no longer. It has minimal effect on ICP and no adverse effect on CPP or neuro outcomes. The speaker does not care for the use of the term \u201cunreality\u201d in the article but cannot think of a better term either.   3. Review Article: Prevalence of Burnout in Paramedics: A systematic Review of Prevalence Studies \u2013 This is a review of five articles. Three instruments from four countries with low response rates. Most are single center studies. Key findings were that burnout is evidently present in paramedics, but exact prevalence is not clear, measurement tools make the prevalence more unclear, and more research into interventions is needed. Patient related stressors were the smallest impact! Personal and work related were the highest. The speaker thinks this is indeed the key finding and they missed it. Personal life issues and work-related stressors (my note: culture?) are more impactful on burnout. He stated there are four other associated articles worth reading on this: Paramedics in Pandemics: Protecting the Mental Wellness of Those Behind the Lines, then The Impact of Working Overtime or Multiple Jobs in Emergency Medical Services (a PEC article), Should Public Safety Workers be Allowed to Nap While on Duty? and Ambulatory Blood Pressure Monitoring among Emergency medical Services Night Shift Workers.   4. Paramedic-Delivered Fibrinolysis in the Treatment of ST-Elevation Myocardial Infarction: Comparison of a Physician-Authorized versus Autonomous Paramedic Approach \u2013 New Zealand location before and after study. Historically this system had ECG transmission failure in about a third of the cases when seeking orders for Fibrinolytics. Paramedics in New Zealand are trained differently than in the United States. Procedure and exclusion checklists were the same in both groups. In the autonomous group, the machine had to have an MI alert, confirming paramedic interpretation, normal QRS or RBBB, and HR of under 130. Drug regimens were the same in both groups. Patients in both groups were similar. There may be Hawthorne effect in this study. Saved eight minutes from 12-lead to needle in the autonomous group. The Hawthorne effect may be that they managed to do 12-leads more quickly in the autonomous group as these were two separate study periods. No greater issues noted with autonomous function. Also look at the PEC article Point-of-Care Troponin Testing during Ambulance Transport to Detect Acute Myocardial Infarction. There may be a synergy between these two interventions.   5. Association of Intra-arrest Transport vs Continued On-Scene Resuscitation With Survival to Hospital Discharge Among Patients With Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest (JAMA) \u2013 \u201cCardiac Arrests are like golf balls \u2013 they should be played where they lie.\u201d This is a reanalysis of ROC data from ten study sites including almost 200 EMS agencies. Overall survival to hospital discharge AND survival with favorable neurological outcomes were favored in the on-scene resuscitation group. Even the ones who had intra-arrest transport that survived still had prehospital ROSC so it is doubtful that hospital interventions offered any particular benefit over what occurred prehospital. Agencies who worked more arrests on scene had better survivability than those who transported during the arrest. There were some variances with some sights that were statistically insignificant. \u201cFriends don\u2019t let friends transport patients in cardiac arrest to the hospital.\u201d If you do have to transport these in your system, do it later than sooner. Day Two:  NAEMSP ON DEMAND SESSION High Flow Diesel Fixes Everything and Other Lies They Told Us in Paramedic School (Johanna Innes, MD \u2013 Buffalo, NY): Prehospital EMS providers are experts at making quick decisions with limited information. Load and go is a decision that is made quickly on every unstable call. EMS notes quick triggers to rapid movement. Many education systems push to get the patient to the ambulance as quickly as possible. The interior of the truck is well lit, has the maximum supplies and less people from the scene asking questions and trying to direct what EMS does. Rapid movement to the unit can lead to missed opportunities to prevent or manage cardiac arrest. Can you do a good assessment, get assessment/history findings and decide what to treat if you are rapidly moving the patient? Education is still saying that providers should dilute their attention and skills to move the patient. In critical trauma this is true. The patient needs blood or the steel of a surgeon\u2019s blade to survive. The CDC guidelines are clear where trauma is concerned, and EMS excels at this. This helps mitigate trauma life threats. However, in cardiac arrest we know this is best worked without moving the patient. CPR is far less effective in a moving vehicle or when the patient is moving. Staying where you are in cardiac arrest leads to better outcomes. They have seen this in Buffalo and in other systems. Some places have not been ready to do so in the peri-arrest patient though. Pittsburgh was an early adopter of a stay and stabilize in place model. Implemented a \u201ccrashing patient\u201d care bundle. It comprises of: No movement, physiological monitoring, aggressive BLS/ALS airway management, aggressive respiratory distress/failure management, early IV/IO access, aggressive IVF/pressors, maximal medication therapy. Agencies that stay and stabilize are seeing improved outcomes. Post contact cardiac arrest was cut by half. Buffalo: Post arrival respiratory and cardiac arrest (PARCA) accounted for 10% of witnessed arrest. Arrest was typically occurring between scene and the back of the ambulance. Stop moving critically ill patient to the ambulance before we perform critical interventions. There is a correlation between unstable vital signs and EMS witnessed arrest. Most had some or all of the following: pulse less than 60, respiratory rate less than 10, SBP less than 90mmHg and/or a GCS less than 14. If moved before obtaining these, how do you know? Equipment must go to patient side. 70% may have respiratory distress. Data is based on recognition of arrest after movement. When does it occur? Pennsylvania reduced on scene care to protocol based on paramedic assessment without criteria. How do we fix this? The book Thinking Fast and Slow was mentioned (my note: this book is mentioned a lot and is a must read for all EMS providers). We must use system 2 thinking and use deliberation and logic rather than \u201cgo\u201d which is system 1 thinking. Education is a barrier. Every paramedic school has a medical director and must ensure that this is being taught. We also have to educate the public as to why we do not just pick up and run to the hospital. They trained their caregivers to explain the reason why we are not moving at the eight-minute point in the arrest. Sometimes we are yelled at to go by other public safety personnel. This has to be trained out by mutual knowledge and engagement/involvement. We also must resist the urge to go to the unit due to light, better environment and more equipment. Bring the equipment into the scene. Drugs go into the scene. We also tend to run with high acuity low frequency calls (my note: this is why Handtevy teaches not to move peds arrest early). We need to start by fixing this in paramedic school and follow up in CME. Barriers need to be addressed. Provide care bundles in protocols before leaving scene. Leave the monitor on and do not disconnect during movement. Build this all into protocols/guidelines. Use direct medical director involvement. Decide how to study the \u201cafter period\u201d following the change.   NAEMSP Infectious Disease outbreaks and COVID-19: Implications for EMS (Milana Boukham Trounce, MD): Professor at Stanford. Has been teaching on this topic for 10 years and has written on this topic. How does this information apply to EMS and preparedness for other bio threats. COVID: EMS providers are at high risk. Mortality risk is several times higher than nurses and physicians after age adjusted comparison. We learned a lot about testing with COVID. Vaccines are now in play and are 95% effective. EMS providers are justifiably first in line for the vaccine. Covered vaccine trial statistics. Primarily anaphylaxis is the main side effect being noted. Time is always our enemy in an outbreak. Infectious diseases have killed more people in history than any other events. When the 1917-1918 Spanish Flu hit, life expectancy dropped to 40 years old as it hit the young. There has been a rise in both natural and intentional biological threats. This changes how we understand risks. Natural drivers: biological hazards follow air travel, urban settings, higher population, encroachment on animal habitats which causes viral jumps to humans. Many diseases are moving north from tropical zones. 30% increase in outbreaks. Numerous Ebola outbreaks since 1976. Accidental/deliberate drivers: advancements in biotechnology, some things eradicated have been brought back. Infectious diseases can be altered to make them more lethal. There are some scary academic studies on this topic. Viruses are hypermutable and can render vaccines and drugs useless. Medical surge capacity is limited including EMS. Without vaccines we turn to quarantine and isolation. All control of pandemic disease is focused on interrupting transmission. This includes a lot of engineering controls in workplaces as well as PPE. Interrupting transmission is important whether airborne or touch. Use antimicrobial surfaces, optimize temperature and humidity, optimize ventilation, filtration and air flow, and UV light. It can be as simple as opening a window. EMS vehicles? Open back of unit between runs, vent fan, patient isolation covers, PPE. Ford has developed internal software for police vehicles that directs the heater to drive temperature up and kill viruses and bacteria. UV light is effective. UV light can cause cancer and cataracts. There is a new light being researched that does no human harm (UV-C). Copper kills SARS-CoV-2 in under 4 hours. To recap, there is a continuing pandemic disease emergence that comes from several causes as noted.    NAEMSP Operational Medical and Public Health Intelligence: Why Now? (Amado Baez, MD): Principles of medical intelligence. Speaker travels the world doing protective medicine. This year he has added a mask to his gun and radio. Experiences from the G20 summit. Medical threat assessment occurs to sum up actions and conditions that can threaten a mission at hand. The intelligence cycle: Data collection, processing, analysis and production, dissemination, feedback, and then planning and direction. A threat matrix helps determine threat based on many factors by risk level, type, and environment. Tactical meteorology is used as well as weather affects assets in medicine. Aircraft landing zones and transport decisions should be considered and determined. Many of the documents used are adopted from law enforcement or military usages. Just because there is an \u201cH\u201d on the roof does not mean the building is structurally sound enough to support a helicopter. Use open-source assets like Google Maps/Earth for mapping and marking plans. They use opposing force simulation to determine vulnerabilities. Other pieces of intel for special event management is entry points, water sources, video, gas detection birds and things that test and monitor the environment. Syndromic surveillance can be passive or active. Reporting system would be considered passive-delayed. An active real time method would be taking temperatures. There is an Epidemiology Intelligence Fusion Center in the Dominican Republic. It infuses data and brains from many organizations\u2019 military, public and private. Watches trends and probabilistic models. They created dashboards for readiness and COVID isolation centers. Must have national policy but local data and management. They identified zone level data in Santa Domingo. In 10 days they were able to break the cycle and change the curve for the Dominican Republic.    NAEMSP ALS to BLS Downgrades: Tools and Data to Assist in the Safety of BLS Transports after ALS Dispatch (Stone, MD \u2013 Butsch, MA): Will cover the advantages and pitfalls of tiered BLS/ALS system responses and downgrades. Will discuss a downgrade checklist. They hope they can help other systems develop tools for this as well. Montgomery County Maryland model. 1.1 million people with 500 square miles. Fire based system. 72,000 transports per year. Primarily use BLS ambulances with paramedics in other vehicles. Allows ALS to return to service when not needed. Downgrades use an evaluation tool for patient safety. Downgrade is independent without medical control contact. 25-40% of ALS dispatches are downgraded (25-35 calls daily). QI focused on downgrades. ALS downgrades can create cumulative risk. These are a form of handoff. Each one may be a sliver of risk that adds up. Where does ALS make the most difference? Paramedic knowledge value is harder to study than interventions. Discussed OPALS study on effectiveness of ALS. This is not about leaving them at home, it is about lowering level of transport. The paramedic brain is more valuable than the paramedic hands. There must be a standard approach to downgrades.  Some require OLMS for this to occur, this system does not. The best systems operate off standing orders. Sometimes, being with the patient is ALS. There were some inclusion criteria in a study on mistriage for downgrades. The numbers in that study were encouraging. What is the pre-transport risk probability? Created a downgrade process, checklist and tracking system.  Multiple factors utilized including what occurred prior to arrival. It looks for high risk complaints and at the assessment. Is relief of human suffering with analgesia needed? Several factors must be managed in ALS downgrades: lack of engagement, pre-judging, inadequate assessment, failure to recognize, insufficient BLS communication and incomplete documentation. There must be visual contact with the patient. The ALS Provider makes the decision on the downgrade. Must have full assessment and complete medical history. Use a handoff mnemonic. It is a mutual and informed downgrade decision. ALS providers may deviate from the form having to be \u201call negative\u201d as over triage is a concern as well. Must be able to defend position on downgrade. Uses FirstWatch to provide surveillance on this process. There has been no increase in ALS scene time. 79.9% appropriate downgrades in the pilot. Full process put in place in November of 2020. Engage the patient at the ALS level. Assure full assessment. Communicate with the BLS crew. Complete the checklist. BLS crews have protection if the downgrade tool is not righteous.     NAEMSP Just Culture and Error Prevention (Streger, JD, Paramedic \u2013 Levy, DO): Bringing just culture to EMS systems. Medical errors are uncomfortable experience. Legal issues, being labeled by peers and potentially harming someone. Human beings are prone to making errors. The single biggest impediment to error prevention in medicine is that we punish people for making mistakes. Reduce opportunity for error. Capture errors before a bad outcome occurs. Allow for recovery from consequences when a patient is hurt. Facilitate crews to make good decisions. Organizations are responsible for the systems they design and that they work as intended. People are accountable for the quality of the care, acting and notifying of errors and issues. Just culture IS NOT blameless. Just Culture IS NOT a punitive culture. There is accountability for actions, but unintentional mistakes should not be punished. When an error occurs, we need to understand why. Most medical errors are related to a system component. We must get to the root cause of an error. Training? Cognitive coaching? Controls? Behaviors do not exist in a vacuum. Behaviors are part of a bigger puzzle. Simple mistake, at-risk, or reckless? Punishment does not end the occurrence of mistakes. We want to get persons to cease error prone activities. A simple mistake does not involve making a choice. Simple mistakes are usually unconscious errors. Corrective actions should correct not punish. Errors and near misses are opportunities to learn. Just Culture is not based on outcome, it is based on risk. At-risk behavior involves a decision with no intent to do harm or be unsafe. This is miscalculated risk. Retraining and remediation is used. Reckless behavior is the red flag. There is an unjustifiable reason for harm or breaking a rule. These cannot be tolerated. This should be a disciplinary referral. Understanding behaviors is essential to Just Culture. Good Just Culture systems use an algorithm or decision tree for assessment of the event. Must define system issues versus behaviors and how the behavior was classified. We must assess what others in the same position would do as well. Would another paramedic have made the same mistake with the same tools and situation? We need a culture of learning and shared accountability. Eliminate fear of repercussion in reporting. Just Culture needs a healthy QI program as well.    NAEMSP Medical Legal Liability Update (Streger, JD, Paramedic \u2013 Levy, DO \u2013 James, MGA): What\u2019s in the claims pipeline? Did the shadow of COVID make lawyers climb under a rock? Claims mix is business as usual. Normally medical director can be excluded but it is expensive. First direct hands-on care issue with a medical director. All cases followed protocols. Most are from bad outcomes. Some related to COVID. Claims are coming in but the judicial system has slowed dramatically. Next year there will be a big spike in published cases after all are heard. COVID has been like building a bicycle while careening down a hill. Things changed quite frequently. Yesterday\u2019s information was tomorrow\u2019s bad information. This caused legal issues. Immunity laws changed. Scopes changed. Both of those helped. COVID caused almost an ET3 model to happen. Many medical directors are often included in wrongful termination suits, but they end up being dismissed. Just because you have immunity does not mean you will not be sued, and you will have to prove immunity. This is a bit sobering to many. Is there exposure in flexing the system? Most COVID related claims will most likely go away as it is felt that juries will not be sympathetic. Many of the changes in EMS systems due to COVID were needed anyway\u2026 alternative destinations, telemedicine, cessation of resuscitation. The biggest problem in these cases is that EMS systems did not explain it to the public. COVID has also been an opportunity for frivolous law suits as well. COVID has been draining to healthcare providers and this is causing PPE questioning and dissatisfaction in other areas. It is a result of COVID fatigue. Beware normalization of deviance. Claims are starting to occur for free-standing IV services, mobile IV services or event IV services. This includes vitamin additives and other non-EMS transport IV services. This is now an insurance exclusion for medical directors. Has become a big problem. Normalization of deviance from standards that removes us from what we should be doing causes big issues. Always contact insurer as to whether something is covered for medical direction services.   NAEMSP Pearls for Management of the Pregnant or Peri-partum Patient (Karin Fox, MD \u2013 Texas Children\u2019s Hospital, Baylor University): To improve population health for women we must focus on all facets of healthcare. EMS is a part of this. Has initiated a maternal transport program (three years ago). Maternal Level of Care designation. Focus on maternal mortality. The U. S. is leading advanced nations in maternal mortality. Hemorrhage is the number one cause of mortality. There is not a lot of public knowledge in this area. Same for providers. Set up the system so it is easy to be successful. Good handoffs. Ensure continuity of care. Maternal designations are being placed like trauma centers. Level IV is the highest acuity center. Lower levels of care need to be educated as to when to refer and transport out. Transport or not transport? Deliver where they are or transport to the maternal center. OB Nurse on team. The best incubator is a stable mother. Are they in labor? What stage? What is travel time (look at time NOT distance)? 49% of counties in the U. S. have no OB GYNphysicians or maternal services. Top five issues for referral: Hemorrhage, cardiovascular events, Infection (including COVID), preeclampsia, and overdose. Maternal-Fetal Conflict: sometimes the focus is on the infant\u2019s well-being and not the mother. The mother is the focus of the maternal team as the mom is the best incubator and protection for the baby. Worried about maternal heart rates over 120. Pre-oxygenation before intubation is critical in maternal care. Edema is not uncommon in pregnant women. Increased tidal volume. Slight respiratory alkalosis. Gastric emptying is delayed. Coagulation factors increase. Asthma, cardiac arrest, overdose, hypothermia, diabetes and many other things are treated the same as normal.  Maternal patients should not be transported absolutely flat due to IVC occlusion (can be an issue with CPR as well). Easy care: IV access, transport tilted to left, mag sulfate present, oxygen, monitor and maintain homeostasis (watch for vital sign changes). Gestational hypertension, preeclampsia and eclampsia are all issues that need managed. If doing CPR, transport for emergent c-section. There is no reason not to try this in the appropriate setting. COVID precautions are important now.  The speaker does not support with holding intubation in COVID or suspected COVID patients in maternal settings. They need to come intubated if needed. There will be increasing demand for EMS services to support transport for these patients.   NAEMSP Vasopressor Intravenous Push to Enhance Resuscitation (VIPER) Study Final Outcomes: The Final Piece of the Triad (Olvera, BA, NRP): When are push dose pressors needed? How does Ketamine interact in this setting? 80 systolic is the threshold for arrest. The window is about five minutes to prevent arrest. End tidal at 24 is about the same threshold. When those two elements occur together arrest is eminent. What about ketamine? Patient\u2019s should not stop breathing and Ketamine is good for that. It also raises BP. It does cause hypersalivation and can cause laryngospasm if pushed too fast. Etomidate causes less desaturation and less hypotension than Ketamine in RSI. So what about push dose pressors? Arrest in peri-intubation is not common. They use Phenylephrine and Vasopressin in their practice. Most literature shows push dose pressors work but do not improve safety or outcome. Push dose pressor use can rapidly bridge the gap and prevent crashing patient arrest. Study had to have a systolic less than 90 and ETCO2 of less than 25. Must be used within 15 minutes before or after intubation. Statistics on study covered rapidly. Both vasopressors raised BP. Both also had relapse hypotension within 20 minutes. Occurrence of Peri RSI Arrest decreased. People who were in the dead graph before PDP use were now just coming in hypotensive. PDP corrects hypotension and decreases incidence of peri RSI arrest.   NAEMSP Oral Abstracts (7-12):   7. Comparing OHCA Treatment and Outcomes of Males and Females: Previous studies have been contradictory. Some studies have shown females have a lower survival rates. 120,306 arrests as a start point. 2011 to 2015. N=65,241 with required study data. 36% were female. Males had 11% more shockable rhythm on initial contact. Males 3.25 higher survival to discharge. Males received defibrillation 13% more often than females. Incidence of receiving Epi was higher in males also. Time to CPR start and first defibrillation was higher in females. Time to first ROSC was slightly higher in females as well. Duration of arrest efforts was shorter in females. The study showed that females were less likely to arrest in public which could explain a longer time to discovery. Further research needed.   8. International Multi-Center Controlled Interventional Trial to Increase OHCA Survival by Implementation of a \u200eDispatcher-Assisted CPR Package (Pan-Asian Resuscitation Outcomes Study Phase 2)\u200e: Study presenter from Singapore. Bystander CPR and survival rates are low in the Asian pacific. Differences between a basic and a comprehensive dispatch CPR package were measured. Multi-national study. Primary outcome was measured as survival to discharge or 30 days. Comparison was between counties that implemented the comprehensive package and those who did not. Comprehensive package sites had better outcomes. This presentation moved very fast and it was difficult to digest the data as to the differences. Wide variations in sample sizes between countries.   9. Community Disparities in Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest Care and Outcomes in Texas: Minority neighborhoods have lower rates of bystander CPR. The disparity is at a national level but did it exist in Texas? N=18,488 in study. Low high school graduation rates were associated with lower bystander CPR and survival. Employment status was not an indicator. Teas did have minority neighborhood disparities. Must be a quality improvement effort to train these communities in Texas.   \u200e10. Real-time Feedback Devices Associated with Improved Outcomes in Cardiac Arrest: Do real-time feedback devices in CPR improve outcomes? There is little research on manual CPR with feedback devices. N=978. Retrospective study from 2012 to 2018. Looked at 30-day survival. Under 18 and trauma was excluded. No differences in bystander CPR or shockable rhythms. Utstein outcome criteria used as well. ROSC improved by 13% with feedback devices. Across all rhythms, neuro intact survival improved by over 5%. CPR compression rate was corrected and slowed slightly. Compression depth was increased with a feedback device. Release velocity was improved as well. Do not drive blind, use a CPR feedback device.   \u200e11. Priorities for Prehospital Evidence-Based Guideline Development: A Modified Delphi Analysis: Gaps exist between EMS care and evidence-based care. What are the gaps? Surveys were used 2019-2020. Open ended questions were used to identify clinical and operational gaps. Identified gaps were rated by members of the Prehospital Guidelines Consortium. 65 clinical and 58 operational gaps were identified. Three top clinical gaps: Airway management in adults and peds, carte of Peds, and management of behavioral health emergencies. Three top Operational gaps: Define and measure impact of EMS outcomes, Practitioner wellness, and practitioner safety. They did not comment on research gaps but guideline gaps with research. Study was before COVID so no pandemic influence.   12. Feasibility and Psychometric Validity of Spanish Language Basic and Advanced EMS Certification Exams: Diverse and disparate models of EMS exist in Latin America. Culture and context are important in EMS certification exams. Some use National Registry translated exams. Subject matter experts reviewed the exams. Psychometric evaluation performed. Nine countries were evaluated. 12% of items were removed following the psychometric evaluation.   Day Three:  NAEMSP ETCO2 in EMS: Questioning the Status Quo (Latimer, MD \u2013 Bulger, Research Coordinator \u2013 Counts PhD): Seattle Medic One has created a database of ETCO2 waveform files. What do we think we know? Low ETCO2 not able to be resuscitated? ETCO2 during BVM utilizable? ROSC heralded by increase in ETCO2? Case study presented on VF arrest patient. CO2 is a byproduct of metabolism. \u201cCO2 is the smoke from the flames of metabolism\u201d \u2013 Ray Fowler, MD. Several accepted usages: ET placement, ET dislodgement recognition, confirming quality of CPR, detecting OHCA and ROSC, component of TOR criteria. ETCO2 is to ventilation and perfusion as ECG is to cardiac rhythm. ETCO2 must be considered a vital sign. Seattle Medic One Airway registry includes the ETCO2 data. LP15 draws power from the ETCO2 module during defib",

                "text": "I picked the header picture based upon what should have been. In years past, during the first  two weeks of January, I have typically been flying to San Diego, Bonita Springs, Austin or even Tucson for this event. This year the only flying to be done was my fingers across a keyboard (but I am not sure that would have been any different rather I was in some distant locale or sitting in my office. I will say that trying to do this annual exercise of note taking while not actually being in the room lacks some distinct ambiance and certainly leaves something to be preferred in networking with others.  That being said, here is the normal disclaimer: I am 100% sure that a few spelling and grammatical errors will be found. Please remember that these are raw, rapidly taken notes with a few pictures thrown in. The point here is to disseminate the great work being done by NAEMSP that I feel should be one of our top sources for change in EMS. Without any further delay, the notes:  Day One:  NAEMSP Welcome & Opening Remarks (David Tan): Welcome to the 2021 National Meeting of the NAEMSP. Speaker has noticed the extreme dedication of EMS during the events of this past year. 2022 will be a fabulous reunion when we can all meet again in person in San Diego. We had great plans for 2020 but those plans were hijacked by COVID. What did NAEMSP do in 2020? Townhall meetings were held on COVID with sample protocols and best practices. NAEMSP worked to assure that EMS emergency medications were included in the act to allow better access during COVID. NAEMSP continues to engage stakeholders in advocacy and the NAEMSP political action committee. The 2021 NAEMSP textbook was updated. Quality medical oversight is an essential facet of prehospital emergency care. NAEMSP position papers and the width and depth of the organization continues to solve problems.    NAEMSP Keynote Address: Compassion in Action - Resilient Leadership in Uncertain Times (Chetan Kharod, MD \u2013 Department of Defense): Speaker is a leader in first response resiliency. Tells the story of being a mid-level residence. Took care of a patient he shall call Mrs. H. Patient had pneumonia. Facility was busy. Patient needed respiratory support, antibiotics and breathing treatments. He checked on her between patients and found her weeping. He walked in and asked what she was needed. He sat down, because if you sit down, they know you are there. She asked for something so that she would never wake up again. He told her he could not. He wiped her head and told her they would help her. He was chastised for sitting with her. The next morning, he remembered he said he would check on her. He went back to hospital and checked on her and found she now considered him to be her doctor (she was telling the attending she wanted to see him). She smiled. The physician who chastised him later apologized as he realized this was proper care. \u201cMy life is My Message\u201d was quoted. Is compassion a weak or a strong choice? Veneer theory or biologic basis for kindness? Is Lord of the Flies inevitable for Man? He submits\u2026 absolutely not! Animals live together as do humans. Survival is possible together. In being alone is great danger. When you see bad behavior or anger, use the phrase, \u201cJust like me,\u201d as in, \u201cJust like me, that person may be in a hurry.\u201d There are perils in social isolation. We are all part of something greater. In EMS, we are aware that we are a part of something greater. We get it. We are dialed in that humans are more important than hardware. Take an item you have. How did you get it? It represents a chain of interdependence. We are incredibly interconnected. There is connectedness whether you note it or not. Self-cultivation is different from being selfish or self-interested. To care for others we have to care for ourselves. You cannot fill the cup of others if yours is empty. Ripple effect affects us. Ripples help transform us for population impact of those in need. Mrs. H was a drop that created a ripple that is still with him today. The ripple continues because it is shared. Leaders set the tone. Leaders have the superpower of emotional contagion. We must be aware of the power we have. Kindness is contagious. It is as simple as holding a door open. Recipients of kindness are more likely to carry on the kindness. One act becomes five, becomes twenty-five becomes one hundred and twenty-five. Do not confuse faith that you will prevail with the discipline to confront the most brutal facts of your current reality. Quotes the Stockdale Paradox. \u201cAs we seek, so shall we find.\u201d The speaker is a Scoutmaster as well. He talks to scouts about the boiling water story. If the challenges of life are boiling water we have three approaches. We can be carrots and become soft and squishy in the boiling water. Or we can be eggs and harden up in the boiling water. Or we can become coffee and turn into something wonderful in the boiling water. Coffee is like smelling hope. Become coffee. Hope is a key. He treated Mrs. H with hope. He told her she would have help getting through her medical issue. Superman was a symbol of hope. Leaders are a symbol of hope. Leadership in uncertain times: Pre-plan, stay sharp, maintain perspective, stay connected, be present, have and give hope and be compassionate. Compassion is strength. Progress is more important than perfection. We will not be perfect every day. Resiliency = individual + team + system. Combine today\u2019s action with tomorrow\u2019s hope. \u201cIt is not enough to be compassionate; we must act.\u201d Our life is our message. He talked about his first military deployment and wondering when it would normalize. Wishing for it to go back to normal does make it happen fast. Be with the ones you are beside. Put a hand on a shoulder. Discuss things that were hard. It is OK to have a bad day. Acknowledge limitations.  NAEMSP Navigating Drug Shortages, Improving Patient Safety, and Reducing Waste (Clayton Kazan \u2013 LA Fire Department): December of 2015, the pharmacy notified the fire department that they would not supply controlled substances any longer. Board of pharmacy was taking action against medical director\u2019s personal licenses. The whole process had to change. He covered the existing process which was intense and complicated. Multiple form processes. Could take up to ten days for restock. Some patients were not getting Morphine because medics were conserving due to length of time to replace. Only the worst pain was being treated. This led to overstocking. In contrast, pharmacies use electronic records, auto-dispensing and stock rotation to prevent waste. Fire stations were not allowed to have dispensing systems by law. The law was changed. Pyxis machines were placed as a solution. The DEA regulations caused confusion with who and where needed licensing. The fire department did all that was needed to be compliant. Dr. Craig Manifold was crucial in working with the Access to Emergency Medication Act of 2017. Covered the system of how the monitor the distribution machines. They have remote monitoring of the stations as well. One machine per battalion. All restocks are compared against the EPCR. Biometric ID is required by both members of the crew for restock. Waste is double signed. Now at 3.5 years and over 20,000 transactions there have only been three vials of Morphine missing. Utilization with patients has increased as now there is no fear of delayed resupply. This caused them to look at other medications. Epi went on shortage. Found EMS was a low priority on distribution when receiving meds from hospitals. They were moving to using Epi as a push dose pressor which increased supply need. They centralized ordering for Epi. Stations started reporting stock and expiration dates. Reduced Epi usage on arrest patients (no benefit beyond 3mg). EPCR data was used to determine needed PAR stocking levels. Ordered through hospital but formed relationships with distributors and manufacturers. End result? They maintained stock when many were out. The epiphany: It showed them how to navigate other shortages. They started to look at all medication stock in the same way. Stations have four-month stock of predicted utilization (California is rated as the worst state for disasters by FEMA). Monthly distribution is utilized. Expired meds are returned. Waste has been drastically reduced which saved a lot of money. They were spending $900,000 annually and wasting $300,000. Now it is at $700,000 with waste at around $100,000. What about drug safety? EMS is a major healthcare organization. They no longer take preloads out of the box. This should not happen. They are boxed for protection from light. Regulatory requirements on storing medications matter. Medication is a core part of the EMS mission. Pharmacists must be a part of your processes. Medical directors are not necessarily trained on what a pharmacist does for a living. Pharmacy training really does not mention EMS. Cross education is a must. There is much return on investment on improving the education and the process. Better compliance, access and security are a result. EZ IO needles are treated as drugs in stock control. Drug shortages are managed. Waste and costs are managed. They would love to share their process with others.   NAEMSP Peer Review for the Medical Literature: How to Help Our Journal (PEC) Grow and Thrive (David Cone, MD) \u2013Editor in chief is changing for the first time in twenty-five years. Why are peer reviews needed? Assess intrinsic value and assesses controversial opinion. It should detect poor study design, flaws of logic, bad science, math errors and erroneous or overstated conclusions. Three options: accept without review, reject without review or send out for peer review. Two thirds of articles go out for peer review. Reviewers are selected by screeners (generally 3 or 4). May also use a specialized reviewer. Manuscripts are blinded. Most do not reveal the authors to the reviewers. Journal publication schedules are tight. If you commit to a review, get it in on time. How to read: Read it three times. One study recommends four hours for review. Use a peer review template. Initial impressions? Does the paper pass the \u201cso what?\u201d test? Conflicts of interest? Look at each section. Mark up the manuscript. Don\u2019t write the review yet. Determine which references to review. Is it clear why the study was done? Is the study question clearly stated? Reproducible? Techniques understandable? Setting explained? Are the statistics reasonable? What analytic methods were used? Do data and results match the methods. Are the results in context? Is the relevance and importance made clear without being over-stated? Does the paper wander off topic? Are limitations missing or under-stated? Figures and tables helpful or fluff? References up to date? Are important references meeting? Grammar, spelling, syntax good? Originality? Validity must be assessed. Discussed the importance of the three readings. Start writing the review. Write a review for the editor and one for the authors. Tell the editor what you really think. Include specific concern comments. What happens next? Editor considers reviews and makes a disposition decision. Decision letters are sent to the authors with either specific or consensus reviews. The editor may be called for advice. Revisions may be handled by the editor. May be re-sent to reviewers. May use new reviewers for revision reviews. Examine the published article against your review.   NAEMSP Building a Relationship with the Medics: The Medical Director Belongs in the Field (Jason Pickett, MD, FACEP and Selena Xie, President Austin EMS Association \u2013 Austin, TX) - Building a relationship with the medics and the workforce is a must. Will discuss perils and pitfalls. The medical director is often seen as scary. This is true of the ER physician as well. Even the smallest comments can be taken as tearing them down instead of support. This view can set the medical director and the relationship up for failure. They must get to know the medical director and feel comfortable asking questions. The medics need to know the medical director knows what they are talking about. There is a real need for the physician medical director to build street cred. The medical director must inspire them to do what is needed and they must know why it is important. Otherwise, they will find ways not to do it. If you add to their burdens they must know why. You must be in their environment or you will be perceived of not understanding their world. Caregivers must believe in medical practice changes and a great relationship helps that adoption. Nothing sabotages future initiatives like a failed initiative. The medical director must identify and understand pitfalls in implementing a new procedure. The medical director needs to gain an intimate understanding of special operations. That understanding is not gained outside of the environment. Equipment is no good without know how. Being out there gives the physician a knowledge of the austere environment where EMS lives. Being out there allows for bedside teaching. We want to instill physician mindset in paramedics in the field and that is done at the bedside. The medical director must create excitement about the care and about changes. When they ask you a question they are thinking about the medicine. Medical errors and near misses must have frank conversations that foster learning, not fear. Process improvement must have a medical director component and involvement and for this to occur, the physician must understand the technique and the environment. Documentation alone cannot cover everything that occurs on an emergency scene. Previous observation helps fill in those gaps. The medical director is a brand, and you have to build that brand. Being aloof from the medics is a bad thing and you will be scene negatively. The physician speaker prefers to be addressed by first name by the paramedics. The rank of physician serves as a barrier to interaction and transparency in the situation. Messaging can be used as well between the medical director and the workforce. Joint messaging between the MD, the caregivers and the EMS organization has proven very beneficial. A pitfall of increased involvement is familiarity. Familiarity may also breed problems with objective review. You must be aware of bias. The medical director should not blur the lines of operational vs. medical authority. We all have to stay in our lanes. Good medicine is sometimes bad tactics. Pick your battles wisely. You will see things that need to be addressed. Pick the ones that are yours as a medical director own. \u201cIf you\u2019re an asshole, it does more harm than good.\u201d Field time is fun. It can get you back to your roots as a medical director. Medics feel excitement and pride at seeing their medical director in the field. Great presentation.  NAEMSP Learning in Place: Overcoming the Obsolescence of Our Initial Education (Scott Bourn, PhD): A few questions? Ponder this. Look at your own practice. Have you had a patient with a disease you never heard of? A toxin? Asked advice about something you did not know existed? Then you are confused just like others on occasion. Speaker had to learn how to be a clinical resource. Initial education only prepared him for the field, not being a resource. Everything he needed to know WAS NOT learned in Kindergarten. Knowledge expires the day after graduation. That is dismaying but true. Why? The world changes. Our role in the world changes. We are really good at some stuff and not really good at other things. We gravitate toward what we are good at. Data influences what we need to know and modify. Data drives personalization. After initial education we have to utilize data to leverage our function. We have to cultivate a new attitude when change is required. We must know that we don\u2019t know everything we need to know. \u201cMastery begins with humility.\u201d We have to learn from failure. When bad things happen make it an obligation to teach and create to keep the bad thing from happening again. We can run from failure or embrace it and use it to grow. Seek and understand the data. Learn leadership and know the data from the clinical practice you lead. Know the data and know it very well. We must analyze the actionable area between literature and operational data. We must build on our strengths. Recognize opportunities to serve where you are strong. Things we are really good at are things were learned faster. Stick to your strengths. Don\u2019t stay in your lane, it is too comfortable. We do not perform at true potential when we are bored. Seek certification to truly know something. Getting out of your lane broadens your impact. You can grow by going back to school or other routes of self-education and immersion. Continual education is hard work. Sometimes it is obvious that we have to learn more very fast to survive in the role we have joined. Remember, what we do is a privilege. Keep refreshing your expiration date.   NAEMSP Community Response and Drone Technology to Improve Outcomes from Rural and remote Cardiac Arrest: The Future is Now! (Cheskes, MD and Snobelen, Paramedic Services Specialist): Public Access Defib has a tremendous impact on survival. There is a solution to get these programs to rural and remote operations. Every second counts in cardiac arrest survival. Urban response times are short. Bystander CPR rates are around 40%. Many places are less than 20%. An AED can still make a big difference. They are simple and easy to use. Many times, an AED is not applied in the public. Patients will say they were lucky because someone did CPR and there was an AED. This outcome should not be luck. Some places are difficult to get to, in fact most of America is this way. Drones can affect this. We have to connect those willing to the patient and the tools. The PulsePoint application serves to connect those willing to CPR with the arrest patient and in many cases an AED. Peel Regional Paramedic Services created a volunteer unit that reports to paramedic services. They are given a response kit. The kit has an AED and associated supplies for cardiac arrest. After the arrest they follow up with the bystander. They also capture the rhythms off the AED. Another option is the drone program. This is considered private access AED. There are many uses for drones. There has been an increase in medical usage drones. They are using Beyond Visual Line of Sight drones. They believe 90% AED arrival in a rural setting of between 10 and 11 minutes is feasible. The program has reached national media attention in Canada. Video was shown of a simulated response. In most cases the drone arrived faster than the ambulance by about three minutes in simulation. Some feasibility flights covered nearly 9km. Surveys showed that the rural populace knew what a drone was but were not familiar with the AED. Delivering an AED without instructions on how and when to use does not meet the goal. AED drops practiced from the drone. Used Facetime App to deliver instructions (smartphone attached to the AED). Some simulations now up to 50km. Illumination added to the AED for night drops. They keep testing new things.    NAEMSP Development of a Sustainable Payment Model for Alternative Destinations (Medero, MD, Smith, MPA and Kasper): Large service area in Albuquerque. Three acute Care hospital ED\u2019s. Do we really need to go to the emergency department with our patients? Greater than 50% of calls are low acuity. ED overcrowding leads delays in receiving care. Goal is to meet IHI Triple Aim (my note: as it should be for all EMS agencies). Use of ETHAN for telemedicine was assessed. Data showing time and cost savings using alternative destinations. Legal review must be a component. What is the capacity for care of the alternative destination? It must be able to address the patient\u2019s needs. Assess what is needed to move forward and act. Using Uber Health as well. No billing/reimbursement path exists today. Financial modeling was used to determine financial impact. Payer sources wanted to see proof of concept before agreeing to participate. Patients were surveyed as to whether they would utilize an alternative destination during a 911 call. Many patients said yes. Many said they would prefer an urgent care over the ED. The payer mix in the survey matched what was seen in normal EMS transport. The cost of using Uber Health to go to ED instead of ambulance to ED was about a savings of $3,400 per patient. State laws differ on the availability to deliver alternative destination care. There is no direct billing code for this service with many payer sources in NM. Many are on managed care plans. There were a lot of challenges in billing and coding restraints. Meetings and research were prolific. There were challenges with physician billing for the telemedicine piece as well. Luckily, everyone wants to see this program work.   NAEMSP Oral Abstracts (1 \u2013 6):   1.\u200e Bougie-Assisted Endotracheal Intubation in the Pragmatic Airway Resuscitation Trial: Airway is an important role in resuscitation. Intubation is difficult with pitfalls. The bougie is a semi-rigid tool for airway insertion. Associated with greater first pass success. Post-hoc analysis of PART on ETI patients. Bougie use was paramedic discretion. Analyzed success and survival at 72 hours. N=1,227 patients. First pass success was not significantly different with or without bougie. Intubation was faster without bougie. No difference in 72 hour survival between both groups. Overall survival was lower in the bougie group. Not a randomized trial. Baseline ETI success rate in the overall trial was low. Findings neither support or refute bougie use. ROC study.   \u200e2.\u200e Effect of Airway Strategy Upon Chest Compression Quality in the Pragmatic Airway Resuscitation Trial: High quality CPR improves arrest outcomes. Airway management may alter chest compression quality. Supraglottic airways may not conflict with compressions. PART study data was used. Better outcomes with supraglottic airways than with intubation. Used CPR waveform analysis from the ECG monitor for compression delays and compression quality. Interruption was defined as a pause for longer than 3 seconds. Examined differences in cases with pauses and with multiple airway attempts. N=1,996. Duration of resuscitation was 3 minutes longer with ETI. Duration and number of interruptions were similar between airway devices, but durations were longer with ETI. Interruptions were shorter with BVM only airway management. This study supports other studies. ROC study. Airway management can influence chest compressions. Airway DOES matter in cardiac arrest. Supraglottic airway use has shorter compression interruptions.   \u200e3.\u200e Measuring the Overuse of Helicopter Air Ambulances for Transport of Trauma Patients: Why does helicopter transport matter? Costly. Risk: 3.62 accidents per 100,00 hours of flight time in 2018. We know that for short distances ground transport is better. For long distances, air transport is better. Strong benefit of air to trauma outcomes. Retrospective analysis using ESO data. Trauma activation criteria used in the study. N=5,984 transported by helicopter EMS. Median age = 44. Over 69% of patients were male. 57% of those transported did not meet trauma center activation. 52% were rural. 17% were super-rural. REMS used for acuity measurement. Over half had no documented trauma activation criteria. Urban setting transports presented no time savings.   \u200e4.\u200e Incidence and Factors Associated with Post-intubation Cardiac Arrest in the Prehospital Setting: Case study presented on the topic. Patient arrested during intubation. Associated factors identified and are multiple. Include obesity, Succinylcholine and others. N=37 patients. All had cardiac arrest within 20 minutes of intubation. COPD was a common factor. Hypotension was also noted as a common factor. 45.9% had IV fluids prior to intubation. 19 received neuromuscular blockade. ROSC was 54.1%. Hypoxemia and hypotension, shock index and RSI were all factors. Important to note that over 50% were normotensive. Dosages were standard for RSI medications. There is no comparison group and small sample size. One EMS organization was used. PICA is due to multiple factors. Resuscitate before you intubate. More studies needed.   \u200e5.\u200e Applying a Set of Termination of Resuscitation Criteria to Pediatric Out-of-hospital Cardiac Arrest: OHCA in children incidence is low. Survival has improved but rate is still low and neuro outcomes need improvement. TOR criteria is primarily prevalent in adult patients and rare for Peds. Adult studies have shown TOR criteria is applicable to adult patients. pTOR criteria is needed. Retrospective observational study. Study looked at 0-17 age patients. pTOR criteria was applied looking at minimum scene times, amount of Epi and ETCO2 readings. If minimum scene time increased from 10 to 20 minutes PPV was increased to 92.9% with better sensitivity and specificity. Medical pTOR criteria performed far better than Trauma pTOR. ROSC was a proxy for survival in the study. Overall outcomes were not assessed.   \u200e6.\u200e Bougie through i-gel\u00ae Technique for Endotracheal Intubation on Cadavers: Technique of insertion discussed. Procedure taught in cadaver lab. Can be used as a blind intubation technique. Hypothesis was that first pass success of this technique would be 70%. Complicated airway was simulated with a cervical collar. 51 paramedics participated in the trial. Combined first pass success was 69%. 73% with bougie. Technique is slow due to multiple steps. Further research needed. Technique has similar success rate to other methods.   NAEMSP ON DEMAND SESSION \u2013 10 Ways to Die on a Farm: Medical Control Considerations for EMS Medical Directors (Ashley Huff, MD): The farm is the deadliest workplace. 1) Grain bin accidents. In last 50 years over 900 cases of grain engulfment have been reported with a fatality rate of 62%. In 2010, there were 26 fatalities. Grain bridges (caps) collapse and surround and suffocate the farm worker by surrounding the chest. Anticipate crush injury and inhalation of grain dust. Special training needed for rescue. 2)There are also explosions in grain elevators. 3) Auger entrapment: Augers trap farmers and children who live and work on the farm. They cause significant horrific injuries. These are prolonged extrications with need for tourniquets and junctional tourniquets. Amputation may be needed. 4) Power Take Offs: Covers are taken off to speed up use or for maintenance. Clothing is then caught and pulls victim in. Normal reaction time is not enough to escape. Victim is spun around the PTO. 5) Tractor Rollovers: 1,700 died in tractor accidents between 2003 and 2013. The most common type was a rollover. This is a high fatality incident. Crush injuries and spinal cord injuries are common. Rollover protection systems are needed. 6) Front Loaders: Usually injuries are due to this vehicle being used for purposes that it was not intended for. Again, crush and spinal injuries common. 7) Sewage Slurry Pits: It is manure pit in or near livestock pins. Churning the manure creates toxic gasses like Hydrogen Sulfide and Methane. Inhalation can result in immediate collapse and this is highly fatal. When more than one person is down in a farm accident be highly suspicious of this. There are usually two victims before anyone realizes what is going on. 8) Chemical Spills: Anhydrous Ammonia causes bronchospasm and pulmonary toxicity. Large ETT and early tracheostomy may help with sloughed mucosa. 9) Livestock Attacks: Cows are most common during calving season. Veterinarians are commonly attacked. Crush injuries are most common due to trampling. Occurs with horses as well. 108 fatalities from cows between 2003 and 2007. 10) ATVs: Used commonly in agriculture. In 2013 alone there were 99,600 ATV-related emergency department treated injuries in the US. 25% were under 16 years of age. There were 13,043 ATV-related fatalities between 1982 and 2013. Most did not wear safety gear. Few had received any instruction on operation. Most drove them less than one day a week. Destinations: Not all EDs are equal. Rural EDs may transfer to trauma centers. Think about transfer times.   NAEMSP ON DEMAND SESSION \u2013 Top Articles of 2020 (Clemency, DO): Articles of importance from 2020 that may have impact on EMS for years to come.   1.  Epidemiological and Accounting Analysis of Ground Ambulance Whole Blood Transfusion - Whole blood was a pipe dream to most a few years ago. Since then, it has become more prevalent in the prehospital environment. Must be capable to have conversations about things that are being proposed. This was published in Prehospital and Disaster medicine and is on the financial implications. Looked at administrations in a few systems. 46% of administrations of whole blood were for non-trauma conditions. What is unique in this article is the math. It is always hard in EMS to balance impact with cost. It is rare to find attempts at calculation. Five calculations were used in this article: A) Projected EMS runs per whole blood administration = Average EMS runs per month / Average Whole blood administrations per month. B) TOTAL COSTS = Fixed costs + Variable Costsyear1 + Variable Costsyear2 + Variable Costsyearx. C) Average Costs = Total Costs / Total Administrations. D) Projected lives saved annually = Annual total whole blood administrations / Number Needed to Treat to save a life. E) Average cost of a life saved = Total Costs / Total projected lives save. Using these calculations, you could in theory insert any medication or procedure and determine cost per life saved (my note: like Naloxone? ITD? Lucas?). Used a demand forecast as well looking toward more use in future years. By year ten it was projected that he average cost of whole blood to save a life would be around $5,100. They used a monitor/defib and associated disposables was used for comparison at $1,700 per life saved over ten years. He notes that blood transfusion does not need to be as good as a monitor to still have benefit, but it does put the costs into perspective. The question is, what other things are we doing in EMS that would not pass this test? \u201cWhat wouldn\u2019t cut the mustard?\u201d   2. Ketamine Use in Prehospital and Hospital Treatment of the Acute Trauma Patient: A Joint Position Statement \u2013 This is a PEC article and contains a joint position statement from ACS, ACEP, NAEMSP, NASEMSO and NAEMT. At the end of the article, there are quite a few more organizations who signed off at the end including the American Academy of Pediatrics. The speaker encourages anyone using or thinking about using Ketamine in their system to dive into this position statement. Discusses indications but the document weighs heavily towards trauma. The speaker likes the fact that the statement used terms like \u201cpreferable\u201d and \u201cexcellent\u201d regarding Ketamine. The dosing section starts with admission that here is no standard dosing guideline available. The position statement uses dosages for Analgesia of 0.1-0.3 mg/kg (max 30mg) IV every 20 minutes PRN for a max of three doses (weight based) or 20 mg slow IV/IO push over 1 minute repeat every 20 minutes (non-weight based). For acute agitation or excited delirium: 3-5 mg/kg IM or 1-2 mg/kg IV. Side affects covered. Rapid IV bolus can cause transient apnea. Normal side effects covered as well. ETCO2 monitoring should be used. Emergence reactions believed to be rare and can be handled with benzodiazepines. Pre-medicating with benzodiazepines is not recommended. Most side effects are transient. Over sedation is usually seen in combination with benzodiazepines. Ketamine was once considered bad in head trauma, but no longer. It has minimal effect on ICP and no adverse effect on CPP or neuro outcomes. The speaker does not care for the use of the term \u201cunreality\u201d in the article but cannot think of a better term either.   3. Review Article: Prevalence of Burnout in Paramedics: A systematic Review of Prevalence Studies \u2013 This is a review of five articles. Three instruments from four countries with low response rates. Most are single center studies. Key findings were that burnout is evidently present in paramedics, but exact prevalence is not clear, measurement tools make the prevalence more unclear, and more research into interventions is needed. Patient related stressors were the smallest impact! Personal and work related were the highest. The speaker thinks this is indeed the key finding and they missed it. Personal life issues and work-related stressors (my note: culture?) are more impactful on burnout. He stated there are four other associated articles worth reading on this: Paramedics in Pandemics: Protecting the Mental Wellness of Those Behind the Lines, then The Impact of Working Overtime or Multiple Jobs in Emergency Medical Services (a PEC article), Should Public Safety Workers be Allowed to Nap While on Duty? and Ambulatory Blood Pressure Monitoring among Emergency medical Services Night Shift Workers.   4. Paramedic-Delivered Fibrinolysis in the Treatment of ST-Elevation Myocardial Infarction: Comparison of a Physician-Authorized versus Autonomous Paramedic Approach \u2013 New Zealand location before and after study. Historically this system had ECG transmission failure in about a third of the cases when seeking orders for Fibrinolytics. Paramedics in New Zealand are trained differently than in the United States. Procedure and exclusion checklists were the same in both groups. In the autonomous group, the machine had to have an MI alert, confirming paramedic interpretation, normal QRS or RBBB, and HR of under 130. Drug regimens were the same in both groups. Patients in both groups were similar. There may be Hawthorne effect in this study. Saved eight minutes from 12-lead to needle in the autonomous group. The Hawthorne effect may be that they managed to do 12-leads more quickly in the autonomous group as these were two separate study periods. No greater issues noted with autonomous function. Also look at the PEC article Point-of-Care Troponin Testing during Ambulance Transport to Detect Acute Myocardial Infarction. There may be a synergy between these two interventions.   5. Association of Intra-arrest Transport vs Continued On-Scene Resuscitation With Survival to Hospital Discharge Among Patients With Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest (JAMA) \u2013 \u201cCardiac Arrests are like golf balls \u2013 they should be played where they lie.\u201d This is a reanalysis of ROC data from ten study sites including almost 200 EMS agencies. Overall survival to hospital discharge AND survival with favorable neurological outcomes were favored in the on-scene resuscitation group. Even the ones who had intra-arrest transport that survived still had prehospital ROSC so it is doubtful that hospital interventions offered any particular benefit over what occurred prehospital. Agencies who worked more arrests on scene had better survivability than those who transported during the arrest. There were some variances with some sights that were statistically insignificant. \u201cFriends don\u2019t let friends transport patients in cardiac arrest to the hospital.\u201d If you do have to transport these in your system, do it later than sooner. Day Two:  NAEMSP ON DEMAND SESSION High Flow Diesel Fixes Everything and Other Lies They Told Us in Paramedic School (Johanna Innes, MD \u2013 Buffalo, NY): Prehospital EMS providers are experts at making quick decisions with limited information. Load and go is a decision that is made quickly on every unstable call. EMS notes quick triggers to rapid movement. Many education systems push to get the patient to the ambulance as quickly as possible. The interior of the truck is well lit, has the maximum supplies and less people from the scene asking questions and trying to direct what EMS does. Rapid movement to the unit can lead to missed opportunities to prevent or manage cardiac arrest. Can you do a good assessment, get assessment/history findings and decide what to treat if you are rapidly moving the patient? Education is still saying that providers should dilute their attention and skills to move the patient. In critical trauma this is true. The patient needs blood or the steel of a surgeon\u2019s blade to survive. The CDC guidelines are clear where trauma is concerned, and EMS excels at this. This helps mitigate trauma life threats. However, in cardiac arrest we know this is best worked without moving the patient. CPR is far less effective in a moving vehicle or when the patient is moving. Staying where you are in cardiac arrest leads to better outcomes. They have seen this in Buffalo and in other systems. Some places have not been ready to do so in the peri-arrest patient though. Pittsburgh was an early adopter of a stay and stabilize in place model. Implemented a \u201ccrashing patient\u201d care bundle. It comprises of: No movement, physiological monitoring, aggressive BLS/ALS airway management, aggressive respiratory distress/failure management, early IV/IO access, aggressive IVF/pressors, maximal medication therapy. Agencies that stay and stabilize are seeing improved outcomes. Post contact cardiac arrest was cut by half. Buffalo: Post arrival respiratory and cardiac arrest (PARCA) accounted for 10% of witnessed arrest. Arrest was typically occurring between scene and the back of the ambulance. Stop moving critically ill patient to the ambulance before we perform critical interventions. There is a correlation between unstable vital signs and EMS witnessed arrest. Most had some or all of the following: pulse less than 60, respiratory rate less than 10, SBP less than 90mmHg and/or a GCS less than 14. If moved before obtaining these, how do you know? Equipment must go to patient side. 70% may have respiratory distress. Data is based on recognition of arrest after movement. When does it occur? Pennsylvania reduced on scene care to protocol based on paramedic assessment without criteria. How do we fix this? The book Thinking Fast and Slow was mentioned (my note: this book is mentioned a lot and is a must read for all EMS providers). We must use system 2 thinking and use deliberation and logic rather than \u201cgo\u201d which is system 1 thinking. Education is a barrier. Every paramedic school has a medical director and must ensure that this is being taught. We also have to educate the public as to why we do not just pick up and run to the hospital. They trained their caregivers to explain the reason why we are not moving at the eight-minute point in the arrest. Sometimes we are yelled at to go by other public safety personnel. This has to be trained out by mutual knowledge and engagement/involvement. We also must resist the urge to go to the unit due to light, better environment and more equipment. Bring the equipment into the scene. Drugs go into the scene. We also tend to run with high acuity low frequency calls (my note: this is why Handtevy teaches not to move peds arrest early). We need to start by fixing this in paramedic school and follow up in CME. Barriers need to be addressed. Provide care bundles in protocols before leaving scene. Leave the monitor on and do not disconnect during movement. Build this all into protocols/guidelines. Use direct medical director involvement. Decide how to study the \u201cafter period\u201d following the change.   NAEMSP Infectious Disease outbreaks and COVID-19: Implications for EMS (Milana Boukham Trounce, MD): Professor at Stanford. Has been teaching on this topic for 10 years and has written on this topic. How does this information apply to EMS and preparedness for other bio threats. COVID: EMS providers are at high risk. Mortality risk is several times higher than nurses and physicians after age adjusted comparison. We learned a lot about testing with COVID. Vaccines are now in play and are 95% effective. EMS providers are justifiably first in line for the vaccine. Covered vaccine trial statistics. Primarily anaphylaxis is the main side effect being noted. Time is always our enemy in an outbreak. Infectious diseases have killed more people in history than any other events. When the 1917-1918 Spanish Flu hit, life expectancy dropped to 40 years old as it hit the young. There has been a rise in both natural and intentional biological threats. This changes how we understand risks. Natural drivers: biological hazards follow air travel, urban settings, higher population, encroachment on animal habitats which causes viral jumps to humans. Many diseases are moving north from tropical zones. 30% increase in outbreaks. Numerous Ebola outbreaks since 1976. Accidental/deliberate drivers: advancements in biotechnology, some things eradicated have been brought back. Infectious diseases can be altered to make them more lethal. There are some scary academic studies on this topic. Viruses are hypermutable and can render vaccines and drugs useless. Medical surge capacity is limited including EMS. Without vaccines we turn to quarantine and isolation. All control of pandemic disease is focused on interrupting transmission. This includes a lot of engineering controls in workplaces as well as PPE. Interrupting transmission is important whether airborne or touch. Use antimicrobial surfaces, optimize temperature and humidity, optimize ventilation, filtration and air flow, and UV light. It can be as simple as opening a window. EMS vehicles? Open back of unit between runs, vent fan, patient isolation covers, PPE. Ford has developed internal software for police vehicles that directs the heater to drive temperature up and kill viruses and bacteria. UV light is effective. UV light can cause cancer and cataracts. There is a new light being researched that does no human harm (UV-C). Copper kills SARS-CoV-2 in under 4 hours. To recap, there is a continuing pandemic disease emergence that comes from several causes as noted.    NAEMSP Operational Medical and Public Health Intelligence: Why Now? (Amado Baez, MD): Principles of medical intelligence. Speaker travels the world doing protective medicine. This year he has added a mask to his gun and radio. Experiences from the G20 summit. Medical threat assessment occurs to sum up actions and conditions that can threaten a mission at hand. The intelligence cycle: Data collection, processing, analysis and production, dissemination, feedback, and then planning and direction. A threat matrix helps determine threat based on many factors by risk level, type, and environment. Tactical meteorology is used as well as weather affects assets in medicine. Aircraft landing zones and transport decisions should be considered and determined. Many of the documents used are adopted from law enforcement or military usages. Just because there is an \u201cH\u201d on the roof does not mean the building is structurally sound enough to support a helicopter. Use open-source assets like Google Maps/Earth for mapping and marking plans. They use opposing force simulation to determine vulnerabilities. Other pieces of intel for special event management is entry points, water sources, video, gas detection birds and things that test and monitor the environment. Syndromic surveillance can be passive or active. Reporting system would be considered passive-delayed. An active real time method would be taking temperatures. There is an Epidemiology Intelligence Fusion Center in the Dominican Republic. It infuses data and brains from many organizations\u2019 military, public and private. Watches trends and probabilistic models. They created dashboards for readiness and COVID isolation centers. Must have national policy but local data and management. They identified zone level data in Santa Domingo. In 10 days they were able to break the cycle and change the curve for the Dominican Republic.    NAEMSP ALS to BLS Downgrades: Tools and Data to Assist in the Safety of BLS Transports after ALS Dispatch (Stone, MD \u2013 Butsch, MA): Will cover the advantages and pitfalls of tiered BLS/ALS system responses and downgrades. Will discuss a downgrade checklist. They hope they can help other systems develop tools for this as well. Montgomery County Maryland model. 1.1 million people with 500 square miles. Fire based system. 72,000 transports per year. Primarily use BLS ambulances with paramedics in other vehicles. Allows ALS to return to service when not needed. Downgrades use an evaluation tool for patient safety. Downgrade is independent without medical control contact. 25-40% of ALS dispatches are downgraded (25-35 calls daily). QI focused on downgrades. ALS downgrades can create cumulative risk. These are a form of handoff. Each one may be a sliver of risk that adds up. Where does ALS make the most difference? Paramedic knowledge value is harder to study than interventions. Discussed OPALS study on effectiveness of ALS. This is not about leaving them at home, it is about lowering level of transport. The paramedic brain is more valuable than the paramedic hands. There must be a standard approach to downgrades.  Some require OLMS for this to occur, this system does not. The best systems operate off standing orders. Sometimes, being with the patient is ALS. There were some inclusion criteria in a study on mistriage for downgrades. The numbers in that study were encouraging. What is the pre-transport risk probability? Created a downgrade process, checklist and tracking system.  Multiple factors utilized including what occurred prior to arrival. It looks for high risk complaints and at the assessment. Is relief of human suffering with analgesia needed? Several factors must be managed in ALS downgrades: lack of engagement, pre-judging, inadequate assessment, failure to recognize, insufficient BLS communication and incomplete documentation. There must be visual contact with the patient. The ALS Provider makes the decision on the downgrade. Must have full assessment and complete medical history. Use a handoff mnemonic. It is a mutual and informed downgrade decision. ALS providers may deviate from the form having to be \u201call negative\u201d as over triage is a concern as well. Must be able to defend position on downgrade. Uses FirstWatch to provide surveillance on this process. There has been no increase in ALS scene time. 79.9% appropriate downgrades in the pilot. Full process put in place in November of 2020. Engage the patient at the ALS level. Assure full assessment. Communicate with the BLS crew. Complete the checklist. BLS crews have protection if the downgrade tool is not righteous.     NAEMSP Just Culture and Error Prevention (Streger, JD, Paramedic \u2013 Levy, DO): Bringing just culture to EMS systems. Medical errors are uncomfortable experience. Legal issues, being labeled by peers and potentially harming someone. Human beings are prone to making errors. The single biggest impediment to error prevention in medicine is that we punish people for making mistakes. Reduce opportunity for error. Capture errors before a bad outcome occurs. Allow for recovery from consequences when a patient is hurt. Facilitate crews to make good decisions. Organizations are responsible for the systems they design and that they work as intended. People are accountable for the quality of the care, acting and notifying of errors and issues. Just culture IS NOT blameless. Just Culture IS NOT a punitive culture. There is accountability for actions, but unintentional mistakes should not be punished. When an error occurs, we need to understand why. Most medical errors are related to a system component. We must get to the root cause of an error. Training? Cognitive coaching? Controls? Behaviors do not exist in a vacuum. Behaviors are part of a bigger puzzle. Simple mistake, at-risk, or reckless? Punishment does not end the occurrence of mistakes. We want to get persons to cease error prone activities. A simple mistake does not involve making a choice. Simple mistakes are usually unconscious errors. Corrective actions should correct not punish. Errors and near misses are opportunities to learn. Just Culture is not based on outcome, it is based on risk. At-risk behavior involves a decision with no intent to do harm or be unsafe. This is miscalculated risk. Retraining and remediation is used. Reckless behavior is the red flag. There is an unjustifiable reason for harm or breaking a rule. These cannot be tolerated. This should be a disciplinary referral. Understanding behaviors is essential to Just Culture. Good Just Culture systems use an algorithm or decision tree for assessment of the event. Must define system issues versus behaviors and how the behavior was classified. We must assess what others in the same position would do as well. Would another paramedic have made the same mistake with the same tools and situation? We need a culture of learning and shared accountability. Eliminate fear of repercussion in reporting. Just Culture needs a healthy QI program as well.    NAEMSP Medical Legal Liability Update (Streger, JD, Paramedic \u2013 Levy, DO \u2013 James, MGA): What\u2019s in the claims pipeline? Did the shadow of COVID make lawyers climb under a rock? Claims mix is business as usual. Normally medical director can be excluded but it is expensive. First direct hands-on care issue with a medical director. All cases followed protocols. Most are from bad outcomes. Some related to COVID. Claims are coming in but the judicial system has slowed dramatically. Next year there will be a big spike in published cases after all are heard. COVID has been like building a bicycle while careening down a hill. Things changed quite frequently. Yesterday\u2019s information was tomorrow\u2019s bad information. This caused legal issues. Immunity laws changed. Scopes changed. Both of those helped. COVID caused almost an ET3 model to happen. Many medical directors are often included in wrongful termination suits, but they end up being dismissed. Just because you have immunity does not mean you will not be sued, and you will have to prove immunity. This is a bit sobering to many. Is there exposure in flexing the system? Most COVID related claims will most likely go away as it is felt that juries will not be sympathetic. Many of the changes in EMS systems due to COVID were needed anyway\u2026 alternative destinations, telemedicine, cessation of resuscitation. The biggest problem in these cases is that EMS systems did not explain it to the public. COVID has also been an opportunity for frivolous law suits as well. COVID has been draining to healthcare providers and this is causing PPE questioning and dissatisfaction in other areas. It is a result of COVID fatigue. Beware normalization of deviance. Claims are starting to occur for free-standing IV services, mobile IV services or event IV services. This includes vitamin additives and other non-EMS transport IV services. This is now an insurance exclusion for medical directors. Has become a big problem. Normalization of deviance from standards that removes us from what we should be doing causes big issues. Always contact insurer as to whether something is covered for medical direction services.   NAEMSP Pearls for Management of the Pregnant or Peri-partum Patient (Karin Fox, MD \u2013 Texas Children\u2019s Hospital, Baylor University): To improve population health for women we must focus on all facets of healthcare. EMS is a part of this. Has initiated a maternal transport program (three years ago). Maternal Level of Care designation. Focus on maternal mortality. The U. S. is leading advanced nations in maternal mortality. Hemorrhage is the number one cause of mortality. There is not a lot of public knowledge in this area. Same for providers. Set up the system so it is easy to be successful. Good handoffs. Ensure continuity of care. Maternal designations are being placed like trauma centers. Level IV is the highest acuity center. Lower levels of care need to be educated as to when to refer and transport out. Transport or not transport? Deliver where they are or transport to the maternal center. OB Nurse on team. The best incubator is a stable mother. Are they in labor? What stage? What is travel time (look at time NOT distance)? 49% of counties in the U. S. have no OB GYNphysicians or maternal services. Top five issues for referral: Hemorrhage, cardiovascular events, Infection (including COVID), preeclampsia, and overdose. Maternal-Fetal Conflict: sometimes the focus is on the infant\u2019s well-being and not the mother. The mother is the focus of the maternal team as the mom is the best incubator and protection for the baby. Worried about maternal heart rates over 120. Pre-oxygenation before intubation is critical in maternal care. Edema is not uncommon in pregnant women. Increased tidal volume. Slight respiratory alkalosis. Gastric emptying is delayed. Coagulation factors increase. Asthma, cardiac arrest, overdose, hypothermia, diabetes and many other things are treated the same as normal.  Maternal patients should not be transported absolutely flat due to IVC occlusion (can be an issue with CPR as well). Easy care: IV access, transport tilted to left, mag sulfate present, oxygen, monitor and maintain homeostasis (watch for vital sign changes). Gestational hypertension, preeclampsia and eclampsia are all issues that need managed. If doing CPR, transport for emergent c-section. There is no reason not to try this in the appropriate setting. COVID precautions are important now.  The speaker does not support with holding intubation in COVID or suspected COVID patients in maternal settings. They need to come intubated if needed. There will be increasing demand for EMS services to support transport for these patients.   NAEMSP Vasopressor Intravenous Push to Enhance Resuscitation (VIPER) Study Final Outcomes: The Final Piece of the Triad (Olvera, BA, NRP): When are push dose pressors needed? How does Ketamine interact in this setting? 80 systolic is the threshold for arrest. The window is about five minutes to prevent arrest. End tidal at 24 is about the same threshold. When those two elements occur together arrest is eminent. What about ketamine? Patient\u2019s should not stop breathing and Ketamine is good for that. It also raises BP. It does cause hypersalivation and can cause laryngospasm if pushed too fast. Etomidate causes less desaturation and less hypotension than Ketamine in RSI. So what about push dose pressors? Arrest in peri-intubation is not common. They use Phenylephrine and Vasopressin in their practice. Most literature shows push dose pressors work but do not improve safety or outcome. Push dose pressor use can rapidly bridge the gap and prevent crashing patient arrest. Study had to have a systolic less than 90 and ETCO2 of less than 25. Must be used within 15 minutes before or after intubation. Statistics on study covered rapidly. Both vasopressors raised BP. Both also had relapse hypotension within 20 minutes. Occurrence of Peri RSI Arrest decreased. People who were in the dead graph before PDP use were now just coming in hypotensive. PDP corrects hypotension and decreases incidence of peri RSI arrest.   NAEMSP Oral Abstracts (7-12):   7. Comparing OHCA Treatment and Outcomes of Males and Females: Previous studies have been contradictory. Some studies have shown females have a lower survival rates. 120,306 arrests as a start point. 2011 to 2015. N=65,241 with required study data. 36% were female. Males had 11% more shockable rhythm on initial contact. Males 3.25 higher survival to discharge. Males received defibrillation 13% more often than females. Incidence of receiving Epi was higher in males also. Time to CPR start and first defibrillation was higher in females. Time to first ROSC was slightly higher in females as well. Duration of arrest efforts was shorter in females. The study showed that females were less likely to arrest in public which could explain a longer time to discovery. Further research needed.   8. International Multi-Center Controlled Interventional Trial to Increase OHCA Survival by Implementation of a \u200eDispatcher-Assisted CPR Package (Pan-Asian Resuscitation Outcomes Study Phase 2)\u200e: Study presenter from Singapore. Bystander CPR and survival rates are low in the Asian pacific. Differences between a basic and a comprehensive dispatch CPR package were measured. Multi-national study. Primary outcome was measured as survival to discharge or 30 days. Comparison was between counties that implemented the comprehensive package and those who did not. Comprehensive package sites had better outcomes. This presentation moved very fast and it was difficult to digest the data as to the differences. Wide variations in sample sizes between countries.   9. Community Disparities in Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest Care and Outcomes in Texas: Minority neighborhoods have lower rates of bystander CPR. The disparity is at a national level but did it exist in Texas? N=18,488 in study. Low high school graduation rates were associated with lower bystander CPR and survival. Employment status was not an indicator. Teas did have minority neighborhood disparities. Must be a quality improvement effort to train these communities in Texas.   \u200e10. Real-time Feedback Devices Associated with Improved Outcomes in Cardiac Arrest: Do real-time feedback devices in CPR improve outcomes? There is little research on manual CPR with feedback devices. N=978. Retrospective study from 2012 to 2018. Looked at 30-day survival. Under 18 and trauma was excluded. No differences in bystander CPR or shockable rhythms. Utstein outcome criteria used as well. ROSC improved by 13% with feedback devices. Across all rhythms, neuro intact survival improved by over 5%. CPR compression rate was corrected and slowed slightly. Compression depth was increased with a feedback device. Release velocity was improved as well. Do not drive blind, use a CPR feedback device.   \u200e11. Priorities for Prehospital Evidence-Based Guideline Development: A Modified Delphi Analysis: Gaps exist between EMS care and evidence-based care. What are the gaps? Surveys were used 2019-2020. Open ended questions were used to identify clinical and operational gaps. Identified gaps were rated by members of the Prehospital Guidelines Consortium. 65 clinical and 58 operational gaps were identified. Three top clinical gaps: Airway management in adults and peds, carte of Peds, and management of behavioral health emergencies. Three top Operational gaps: Define and measure impact of EMS outcomes, Practitioner wellness, and practitioner safety. They did not comment on research gaps but guideline gaps with research. Study was before COVID so no pandemic influence.   12. Feasibility and Psychometric Validity of Spanish Language Basic and Advanced EMS Certification Exams: Diverse and disparate models of EMS exist in Latin America. Culture and context are important in EMS certification exams. Some use National Registry translated exams. Subject matter experts reviewed the exams. Psychometric evaluation performed. Nine countries were evaluated. 12% of items were removed following the psychometric evaluation.   Day Three:  NAEMSP ETCO2 in EMS: Questioning the Status Quo (Latimer, MD \u2013 Bulger, Research Coordinator \u2013 Counts PhD): Seattle Medic One has created a database of ETCO2 waveform files. What do we think we know? Low ETCO2 not able to be resuscitated? ETCO2 during BVM utilizable? ROSC heralded by increase in ETCO2? Case study presented on VF arrest patient. CO2 is a byproduct of metabolism. \u201cCO2 is the smoke from the flames of metabolism\u201d \u2013 Ray Fowler, MD. Several accepted usages: ET placement, ET dislodgement recognition, confirming quality of CPR, detecting OHCA and ROSC, component of TOR criteria. ETCO2 is to ventilation and perfusion as ECG is to cardiac rhythm. ETCO2 must be considered a vital sign. Seattle Medic One Airway registry includes the ETCO2 data. LP15 draws power from the ETCO2 module during defib",

We\u2019ve built a world with the mindset of maximizing \u201cme,\u201d creating catastrophic results that benefit no one. But what to do? As Albert Einstein observed, \u201cWe cannot solve problems with the same kind of thinking that created them.\u201d If we want to change the way the world works, we need to update the thinking that created the systems, institutions and economies around us. Otto Scharmer has developed a framework and strategies for guiding this shift in our thinking from an ego-centric awareness to an eco-centric one \u2014 from considering what\u2019s best for me to considering what\u2019s best for the whole, including me. Tune in to find out why embracing this shift is at the core of the leadership the world needs.\u201d At the link right-click \u201cDownload MP3\u201d and select \u201cSave Link As\u201d from the pop-up menu. \n\n\n\nAI and Criminal Justice 38 mins \u2013 \u201cAs technology becomes more sophisticated, artificial intelligence (AI) is permeating into new parts of society and being used in criminal justice to assess risks for those in pre-trial or on probation. Predictive analytics raise several questions concerning bias, accuracy, and fairness. Observers worry that these tools replicate injustice and lead to unfair outcomes in pre-trial hearings, detention, and incarceration. On February 19, Governance Studies at Brookings hosted an event to address the challenges of federal risk assessment instruments in the criminal justice system. Panelists discussed the implications of AI on criminal justice and ways to improve criminal justice reform initiatives.\u201d At the link you can listen, but not download; however,a copy is included in this blog archive. \u00a0 \n\n\n\nAI Principals 39 mins \u2013 \u201cThis virtual talk features Jessica Fjeld, assistant director of the Cyberlaw Clinic and lead author on the \u201cPrincipled AI\u201d report, in conversation with Ryan Budish, an assistant research director at Berkman Klein and a member of OECD\u2019s AI Governance Expert Group, which proposed high-level AI principles. Fjeld and Budish discuss AI principles both generally (the high-level landscape in which they exist) and in practice (the creation and implementation process for principles.) \u201c At the link you can listen,but not download; however, a copy of the podcast is included in this blog archive.. \n\n\n\nArtificial Intelligence 32 mins \u2013 \u201cDarrell West is vice president of the Brookings Institution and director of Governance Studies at Brookings.

Together, they are the authors of the book, \u201cTurning Point: Policymaking in the Era of Artificial Intelligence,\u201d a broad look at the impact that artificial intelligence systems are likely to have on everything from the military, to health care, to vehicles and transportation, and to international great power competition. They spoke with Benjamin Wittes about the book and the question of how we should govern AI systems. What makes for ethical uses of AI? What makes it scary? What are the anxieties that people have about artificial intelligence, and to what extent are the fears legitimate?\u201d At the link left-click the down-pointing arrow and select \u201cSafe File\u201d and \u201cOK\u201d from the pop-up menu. \n\n\n\nArtificial Intelligence 52 mins \u2013 \u201cComputer Scientist and author Melanie Mitchell of Portland State University and the Santa Fe Institute talks about her book Artificial Intelligence with EconTalk host Russ Roberts. Mitchell explains where we are today in the world of artificial intelligence (AI) and where we might be going. Despite the hype and excitement surrounding AI, Mitchell argues that much of what is called \u201clearning\u201d and \u201cintelligence\u201d when done by machines is not analogous to human capabilities. The capabilities of machines are highly limited to explicit, narrow tasks with little transfer to similar but different challenges. Along the way, Mitchell explains some of the techniques used in AI and how progress has been made in many areas.\u201d At the link right-click \u201cDownload\u201d and select \u201cSave Link As\u201d from the pop-up menu. \n\n\n\nAyahuasca Use 19 mins \u2013 \u201cGrowing numbers of tourists are travelling to the Peruvian Amazon to drink ayahuasca, a traditional plant medicine said to bring about a higher state of consciousness. Foreigners come looking for spiritual enlightenment or help with mental health problems like trauma, depression, and addiction. But not everyone is happy about Peru\u2019s booming ayahuasca tourism industry. A group of indigenous healers are fighting back against what they see as the exploitation and appropriation of their cultural heritage by foreigners \u2013 who run most of the ayahuasca retreats popular with tourists. This coming together of cultures has thrown up another serious problem too: vulnerable women being sexually abused while under the influence of charismatic healers and this powerful psychedelic.\u201d At the link left-click \u201cDownload,\u201d select \u201cLessor quality\u201d then \u201cSave File\u201d and \u201cOK\u201d to get the podcast. \n\n\n\nBrown Skinned 36 mins \u2013 \u201cIn a compelling conversation, acclaimed journalist and author Kamal Al-Solaylee discusses all things brown, from the psychology of the colour, to why he says, it\u2019s always \u2018a bridesmaid,\u00a0never the bride,\u2019 in the constructed hierarchy of human skin tone.\u201d At the link right-click \u201cPlay Episode\u201d to listen; a copy of the podcast is included in this blog archive. \n\n\n\nBlack Business Devaluation..83 mins.- \u201cIn 2018, research from the Brookings Metropolitan Policy Program (Brookings Metro) and Gallup showed that homes in Black-majority neighborhoods experience devaluation due to racial bias at a rate of 23% on average, when compared to similar homes in otherwise similar white neighborhoods.

Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed, who just last year won the Nobel Peace Prize for his efforts to bring unity between Ethiopia and neighboring Eritrea, led a military battle against domestic forces in the northern Ethiopian region of Tigray. The fighting has caused the significant displacement of people living in the region and has involved reports of atrocities. In early December, the Prime Minister claimed victory, but concerns remain about how long tensions will endure\u2014or at least continue to simmer. It\u2019s a complicated situation with major implications for stability in the East Africa and Horn of Africa region. To break it all down, Jacob Schulz talked with two different experts.

Its legacy remains. Nowhere more so than in Germany, where the rise of Nazism led to the war, and terrible crimes against humanity. Chris Bowlby explores how post-war Germans have faced this inheritance and discovers how a search for justice in relation to Nazi crimes has continued, despite heavy pressure to stop. Alongside that, a powerful culture of remembrance has emerged, as each new generation makes its reckoning with the past. We meet the little-known small team of Nazi crime investigators, working discreetly behind walled premises in Ludwigsburg in Southern Germany. They used to carry guns for self-protection, such was hostility to their work. Through their research they have identified more than 28,000 Nazi crime scenes. But soon those who lived through the Nazi period will all be dead. What difference will it make when there are no more victims alive to tell their stories, no more prosecutions or trials? Will this history still be remembered and understood?

No less than 5 presidential candidates have released plans to connect the country\u2019s rural places, and the FCC has recently announced a $20billion funding program for fixed broadband and a $9billion program for 5G deployment in rural America. Despite these initiatives and interests, however, rural America remains woefully disconnected from a digital world that the urban and wealthy take for granted. Worse yet, the digital divide is growing, not shrinking despite billions of dollars of yearly investment and dozens of legislative proposals. This talk explains the policies that help and hinder broadband deployment in rural America. Christopher Ali argues that our current policy architecture grossly over-privileges incumbent telephone companies and systematically discourages new entrants from offering broadband, and demonstrates how the largest telecommunication companies have an economic incentive to keep the digital divide alive.\u201d At the link you can listen,but not download; however, a copy of the podcast is included in this blog archive. \n\n\n\nSecondhand Goods 46 mins \u2013 \u201cJournalist and author Adam Minter talks about his book Secondhand with EconTalk host Russ Roberts.

To talk about how they do it across the pond, David Kris sat down with two experts on UK SIGINT and SIGINT regulation: Michael Drury and Tony Comer, both veterans of Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ), the British counterpart to the U.S.\u2019s National Security Agency. Michael was GCHQ\u2019s first full-time legal advisor from 1996 to 2010, when he joined the private sector, and Tony was GCHQ\u2019s historian until his retirement earlier this year. They compared and contrasted the U.S. and UK experience with SIGINT, SIGINT regulation, popular support for SIGINT and intelligence in general, and also some cutting-edge issues, including how SIGINT works today, synergies between SIGINT and cyber, GDPR encryption and online harms.\u201d At the link left-click the down-pointing arrow and select \u201cSafe File\u201d and \u201cOK\u201d from the pop-up menu. \n\n\n\nSocial Media Weaponization 38 mins \u2013 \u201cOn this episode of Lawfare\u2019s Arbiters of Truth series on disinformation, Evelyn Douek spoke with Maria Ressa, a Filipino-American journalist and co-founder of Rappler, an online news site based in Manila. Maria was included in Time\u2019s Person of the Year in 2018 for her work combating fake news, and is currently fighting a conviction for \u201ccyberlibel\u201d in the Philippines for her role at Rappler. Maria and her fight are the subject of the film, \u201cA Thousand Cuts,\u201d released in virtual cinemas this summer and to be broadcast on PBS Frontline in early next year. As a country where Facebook is the internet, the Philippines was in a lot of ways ground zero for many of the same dynamics and exploitations of social media that are currently playing out around the world. What is the warning we need to take from Maria\u2019s experience and the experience of Philippine democracy? Why is the global south both the beta test and an afterthought for companies like Facebook? And how is it possible that Maria is still, somehow, optimistic?\u201d At the link left-click the down-pointing arrow and select \u201cSafe File\u201d and \u201cOK\u201d from the pop-up menu. \n\n\n\nSpymasters 35 mins \u2013 \u201cWhat is the proper relationship between the CIA director and the president? How should directors handle arguably illegal orders? How important is the director\u2019s role as the nation\u2019s honest broker of information during times of crisis? To get at these questions, David Priess sat down with Chris Whipple, a documentary filmmaker, journalist and the author of two books about the people around the president. \u201cThe Gatekeepers,\u201d based upon his documentary of the same name, examines White House chiefs of staff, and his new book, \u201cThe Spymasters: How the CIA Directors Shape History and the Future,\u201d is based on the Showtime documentary \u201cThe Spymasters: CIA in the Crosshairs,\u201d for which Whipple was the writer and executive producer.

It concerns the Turkic minority known as the Uighurs whom the Chinese government has been rounding up and putting in reeducation camps. It is an ugly story\u2014one that the Chinese government has gone to great lengths to keep from international attention, with some degree of success. To walk us through the situation in Xinjiang, Benjamin Wittes spoke with Jessica Batke, a senior editor at ChinaFile; Darren Byler, a postdoctoral fellow at the University of Colorado at Boulder whose research focuses on Uighur dispossession; and Maya Wang, a senior China researcher for Human Rights Watch, who has written extensively on the use of biometrics, artificial intelligence and big data in mass surveillance in China.\u201d At the link left-click the down-pointing arrow and select \u201cSafe File\u201d and \u201cOK\u201d from the pop-up menu. \n\n\n\nUS in China 30 mins \u2013 \u201cJordan Schneider, the host of the ChinaTalk podcast, sat down with H. R. McMaster, President Trump\u2019s former national security advisor. They talked about his time in government; the origins of the 2017 national security strategy, which focused the U.S. government on China; how he thinks history is best applied to policymaking; and even why he considers himself to be the funkiest NSA in U.S. history.\u201d At the link left-click the down-pointing arrow and select \u201cSafe File\u201d and \u201cOK\u201d from the pop-up menu. \n\n\n\nVaccine Misinformation .34 mins \u2013 \u201cThis week on Lawfare\u2019s Arbiters of Truth series on disinformation, Evelyn Douek and Quinta Jurecic spoke with Claire Wardle, the co-founder and leader of the nonprofit organization First Draft and a research fellow at Harvard University\u2019s Shorenstein Center. First Draft recently released a report on the information environment around the development of vaccines for COVID-19, and Claire talked about what she and her team found in terms of online discussion of the vaccine in English, Spanish and French. What kinds of misinformation should we be ready for as vaccines begin to be administered across the world? Why might fact-checking and labeling by platforms not be effective in countering that misinformation? And why is Claire still pessimistic about the progress that platforms and researchers have made in countering dis- and misinformation over the last four years?\u201d At the link left-click the down-pointing arrow and select \u201cSafe File\u201d and \u201cOK\u201d from the pop-up menu. \n\n\n\nVindman Conversation 1 33 mins \u2013 \u201cLt. Col. Alexander Vindman (Ret.) is now the Pritzker Military Fellow at the Lawfare Institute, the newest member of the Lawfare team. You\u2019ve heard his story, likely in his testimony in the impeachment proceedings for President Trump. But Benjamin Wittes sat down with him for a different reason\u2014his substantive expertise in Eastern Europe policy, Russia matters and great power competition. They talked about the challenges the Biden administration will face as it tries to pick up the pieces the Trump administration has left it, how democracies can hang together and harden themselves against attacks from authoritarian regimes, what a good Russia policy looks like, how China fits in and how we can rebuild traditional American alliances.\u201d At the link left-click the down-pointing arrow and select \u201cSafe File\u201d and \u201cOK\u201d from the pop-up menu. \n\n\n\nVindman Conversation 2 36 mins \u2013 \u201cFollowing his appearance on Friday on the Lawfare Podcast, Lieutenant Colonel Alexander Vindman, the Pritzker Military Fellow at the Lawfare Institute, appeared on Lawfare Live for a live video conversation and audience Q&A. It was a very good conversation\u2014so good that we thought we would bring you an edited version of it as Part Two of our conversation with Alex Vindman. He discussed how one becomes an NSC director while serving in the active duty military, what risks the transition period has in foreign relations, whether he has any regrets about his decision to speak out during the impeachment and much more.\u201d At the link left-click the down-pointing arrow and select \u201cSafe File\u201d and \u201cOK\u201d from the pop-up menu. \n\n\n\nWhite Power Violence 37 mins \u2013 \u201cElizabeth Neumann served as the assistant secretary for threat prevention and security policy at the Department of Homeland Security. She has recently been speaking out about President Trump and, among other things, his failure of leadership with respect to the threat of white supremacist violence. In the course of doing so, she made reference to a book by Kathleen Belew, a historian at the University of Chicago: \u201cBring the War Home: The White Power Movement and Paramilitary America,\u201d a history of violent white power movements in the modern United States. Elizabeth and Kathleen joined Benjamin Wittes to discuss the interactions of policy and the history that Belew describes. Why have we underestimated this threat for so long? How has it come to be one of the foremost threats that DHS faces? And what can we do about it, given the First Amendment?\u201d At the link left-click the down-pointing arrow and select \u201cSafe File\u201d and \u201cOK\u201d from the pop-up menu.",

                "text": "I have returned to work after my 4 weeks holiday. It was very relaxing, mostly at home due to the virus, but was very good. The main changes for this year have been to  reduce my work hours slightly, not taking on new patients (unfortunately) but otherwise will continue working as usual.  \n\n\n\nNatural ways to prevent deadly diseases\n\n\n\nNaveed Saleh, MD, MS|January 8, 2021 \n\n\n\nChronic diseases are defined as physical or mental health conditions that last more than one year and result in functional restrictions or ongoing treatment and monitoring. These diseases are among the most frequent and costly in the United States, with about half of Americans diagnosed with at least one chronic condition. \n\n\n\nStudies show that walking is just one of many healthy steps you can take to prevent chronic disease. \n\n\n\nDespite advances in healthcare and breakthroughs in medicine, the prevalence of chronic disease in the United States is on the rise, with more people developing diabetes, hypertension, stroke, heart disease, obesity, and others. Chronic disease results in death, disability, and decreased quality of life. \n\n\n\n\u201cTrends show an overall increase in chronic diseases,\u201d wrote the authors of a study published in the International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health. \u201cThe nation\u2019s aging population, coupled with existing risk factors (tobacco use, poor nutrition, lack of physical activity) and medical advances that extend longevity (if not also improve overall health), have led to the conclusion that these problems are only going to magnify if not effectively addressed now.\u201dADVERTISEMENT -SCROLL TO KEEP READING \n\n\n\nFortunately, there are natural steps that can be taken to decrease your risk of chronic disease. Here\u2019s a look at five natural interventions.\u00a0 \n\n\n\nDitch ultraprocessed foods\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s true that ultraprocessed foods make for easier food choices. But, in this case, easier is definitely not healthier. Previous cohort studies have shown that the consumption of ultraprocessed foods\u2014including chips, white bread, cookies, and soda\u2014is linked to higher rates of cancer, irritable bowel syndrome, hypertension, and obesity. \n\n\n\nResults from a population-based Spanish study indicated that eating four or more servings of ultraprocessed foods each day was related to a 62% increased hazard for all-cause mortality, with each additional serving increasing hazard by 18%. \n\n\n\nUltraprocessed foods lead to chronic inflammation which plays a role in diabetes, heart disease, and cancer. Instead of ultraprocessed foods, eat whole grains, nuts, seeds, fruits, and vegetables. Adopting a Mediterranean diet pattern is also recommended. \n\n\n\nStart stepping\n\n\n\nExercise boosts overall health, fitness, and quality of life, as well as decreases the risk of heart disease, type 2 diabetes, dementia, anxiety, depression, and various cancers. \n\n\n\nWhen most people ponder exercise, they imagine the gym or a structured class. But for chronic disease prevention, all that really matters is frequency and intensity. Simply walking can be a great way to reap the health reward of physical activity. \n\n\n\nAccording to the Cleveland Clinic, \u201cTaking 10,000 steps a day is a popular goal because research has shown that when combined with other healthy behaviors, it can lead to a decrease in chronic illness like diabetes, metabolic syndromes and heart disease. Exercise does not need to be done in consecutive minutes. You can walk for 30 to 60 minutes once a day or you can do activities two to three times a day in 10- to 20-minute increments.\u201d \n\n\n\nHalt the salt\n\n\n\nThe WHO formulated a Non-Communicable Diseases (NCDs) Action Plan for 2013-2020, with the goal of decreasing premature death from heart disease, chronic respiratory disease, cancer, and diabetes by 25% by 2025. Among their recommendations is reducing salt intake. \n\n\n\nThe WHO calls for a 30% relative reduction in the mean population intake of salt or sodium in those aged 18 years or older. In other words, adults should consume less than 5 grams of salt or 2 grams of sodium daily. \n\n\n\nKeep in mind that salt-laden foods don\u2019t necessarily taste salty. High salt content lurks in canned vegetables, canned soups, fast food, cold cuts, and cheese. When in doubt, read the labels for salt and calorie content. \n\n\n\nLimit the spirits\n\n\n\nThe WHO also calls for a 10% reduction in alcohol consumption to curb the health risks of drinking. In particular, it stresses the dangers of heavy episodic (ie, binge) drinking among adolescents and adults. \n\n\n\nThe agency notes that harmful use of alcohol \u201cencompasses the drinking that causes detrimental health and social consequences for the drinker, the people around the drinker and society at large, as well as the patterns of drinking that are associated with increased risk of adverse health outcomes.\u201d \n\n\n\nFor those who like to occasionally imbibe, it may be a good idea to drink smarter. Healthier alcohol choices include hard liquors\u2014which are low in sugar and calories\u2014as well as wine and champagne, which are full of polyphenols and antioxidants. (Champagne is essentially sparkling wine.) \n\n\n\nTake your nutraceuticals\n\n\n\nNutraceuticals such as ginger, curcumin, and green tea can curb the incidence of metabolic syndrome, as well as cardiovascular disease and diabetes.\u00a0 \n\n\n\nGreen tea, for example, decreased levels of body fat and drops body weight. In a study published in the Journal of Research in Medical Science, researchers found that patients with type 2 diabetes who drank 4 cups of green tea daily experienced significant decreases in average body weight (73.2 kg to 71.9 kg); BMI (27.4 to 26.9); systolic blood pressure (126.2 to 118.6); and waist circumference (95.8 cm to 91.5 cm).",

                "text": "I'd heard of\u00a0Integralismo Lusitano, but until I read this, I knew virtually nothing about it. Fascinating! Now, I want to know more. From The European Conservative By\u00a0Manuel Rezende It was the spring of 1913, and the republican political elites in Portugal were getting restless. They had established their own dominion over Portuguese politics, ousted the last king three years earlier, and ruled over the country with a tight grip. The Democratic Republican Party had been an almost invisible party during the 1890s. The Portuguese constitutional monarchy managed to keep the influence of the republicans concentrated around the educated classes and in certain urban areas, mainly in Oporto and Lisbon, the main cities of the Realm. The increasing predominance of French politics in the country, the dictatorship of Prime Minister Jo\u00e3o Franco, backed by King Carlos I, and the subsequent serious decline in the popularity of the monarchist regime created the perfect storm for a Republican Revolution in 1910. The regicide of 1908, which took the lives of both the king and his heir, leaving the throne to an unprepared Manuel II, was the final touch. To be perfectly clear, there had already been a republican revolution in the city of Oporto in 1891. However, these republican partisans were very different; they were nationalist republicans who were weary of British influence in Portuguese international affairs and Portugal\u2019s economy, as well as the powerful and castrating influence of French political thought and philosophy on Portuguese cultural and intellectual production. Unfortunately, this first coup was unsuccessful. It would be a totally different one that would emerge victorious in Lisbon on October 5, 1910. These republicans were positivists of the French school: radical progressives bent on the destruction of religion and the Portuguese social order and committed to the establishment of a Jacobin-like republic that would change the cultural landscape of the country forever. What followed was not entirely unprecedented: priests and nuns were persecuted, while political opponents were taken away by authorities to have their craniums measured. (This was part of an attempt to establish phrenology as a valid method to explain the inferiority of the religious mind compared to that of the so-called rationalists.) At the time, in 1910, republican Jacobinism was a passing fashion in Europe, so Portugal was a political oddity. Thus, the main republican\u00a0caciques\u00a0became quite alarmed when they saw the Portuguese youth getting up with the times, especially, once again, with what was really going on in France. For powerful men like Afonso Costa, Aquilino Ribeiro, Bernardino Machado, and others, the news from Paris was disturbing. The old city of the revolutionaries had died, giving way to a new kind of political opponent: one that was far more terrible than the old liberal and conservative parties of the diseased constitutional monarchy.  It was called\u00a0Action Fran\u00e7aise,\u00a0and its leader was Charles Maurras. Unlike the French Legitimists, the Spanish Carlists, and the Portuguese Miguelists, these were not \u2018normal\u2019 traditionalists. They actually had an agenda other than mere ultramontanist Catholicism and an unbridled defense of the Throne. In fact,\u00a0Action Fran\u00e7aise\u00a0had close ties to the political thought of anarchists like Proudhon and was joined by great names of the Left, such as Georges Sorel. By 1917, these new monarchists could boast of their own magazine,\u00a0Na\u00e7\u00e3o Portuguesa\u00a0as well as the cooperation of unions, liberal workers, farmers, and segments of the army. As a movement, they called themselves\u00a0Integralismo Lusitano\u00a0and their leader was Ant\u00f3nio Sardinha. The birth of the Pelican Much like what had happened in France,\u00a0Integralismo Lusitano\u00a0received the support of thinkers and patriots who had quickly become disillusioned with the Portuguese First Republic. Why should they not? In the 16 years of the First Republic, from 1910 to 1926, Portugal had witnessed 45 governments, an endless series of coup d\u2019\u00e9tats, the dominion of far-left terrorist groups on the streets of Lisbon, and an average frequency of bombs exploding in the streets and apartments of the capital that surpassed that of the first two years of the American occupation of Baghdad. Portugal earned a negative reputation in European circles during those days, and the disastrous participation of Portuguese contingents during the First World War did little to help. Sardinha was himself an ex-republican. However, he would always look back to those early days as a revolutionary youth and, even combined his newfound Catholic faith, to the values he had been taught by the republican nationalists who had been vanquished in 1891.\u00a0Integralismo Lusitano\u00a0took much from\u00a0Action Fran\u00e7aise, but Sardinha made sure he would give it its\u00a0own\u00a0identity. The Portuguese integralists based their worldview in history and theory, claiming both the legacy of the Thomists as well as the novelties of Comte\u2019s positivism. They looked for inspiration in the medieval guild system and in the doctrines of Georges Sorel around the theory of myth. This unique blend of Tradition and Modernity sought to validate Portugal both as an independent organism and as a collective soul. That, in particular, was a consequence of Maurras\u2019s great influence. Maurras and\u00a0Action Fran\u00e7aise\u00a0were fighting the individualism that had been gnawing away at the roots of Europe ever since the French Revolution. Their great discovery \u2014 bolstered by\u00a0the work of Numa Denis Fustel de Coulanges\u00a0and the French Sociologists \u2014 was that communities had a life of their own, a collective destiny. To mark their movement as something unique and distinct from their French counterparts, the Portuguese integralists adopted as their symbol the Pelican, a Christian symbol relating to the sacrifice of Jesus Christ. A pelican was also used as the personal seal of Portugal\u2019s King Jo\u00e3o II (1455-1495), a great reformer who contributed to some of the greatest achievements of the Portuguese \u2018Age of Discovery\u2019 (such as the finding of a sea route to India). This 82 x 72 cm ceramic medallion, created in the workshop of Andrea Della Robbia in the 16th century, celebrates the memory of King Jo\u00e3o II of Portugal. It is composed of three elements, according to the Museu Nacional de Arte Antiga in Lisbon: \u201cthe pelican feeding its young with its blood \u2014 which is a Christological, Eucharistic, and political symbol associated with the motto \u2018For the Law and for the People\u2019 \u2014 forms the body of the emblem; the phrase \u2018IVSTVS VT PALMA FLOREBIT ET\u2019 (the righteous shall flourish like the palm tree), which is taken from the Book of Psalms (92:13), is the soul of the emblem; the top of the palm tree \u2014 which serves as the nest for the baby pelicans \u2014 is the symbol of righteous men.\u201dSardinha thus set forth to discover the \u2018destiny\u2019 of the Portuguese people, one that would be ruled by a regime suited to the characteristics of the Portuguese. This would not be a French style republic, nor another fake parliamentary democracy, de facto ruled by the capitalist elite; instead, it would be something else, informed by history and psychology. It would not be an effort at historical recreation but, as Sardinha put it, a\u00a0return\u00a0to something that should never have been interrupted, and it would be as if it had never been interrupted\u00a0at all. It was an organic, social monarchy, established as a democracy in its lower levels, a democratic municipality based upon the free association of communities and professions, followed by an aristocracy at the level of the administration of the state, a bureaucracy of merit and service, and on top the rule of the king, who acted as a ruler but not as an administrator.  Sardinha\u2019s ideas would evolve over the years. He even clashed with some of his supporters after publishing the infamous\u00a0A Quest\u00e3o Ib\u00e9rica\u00a0(1916), a book about the necessity of forming an alliance with Spain. His late political thought, however, seemed to have focused less on the dichotomy between monarchy and republic, as evidenced by the ties he formed with well-known republicans such as Ant\u00f3nio S\u00e9rgio. Sardinha\u00a0\u00a0and many integralists also cooperated with other conservatives, non-Catholic traditionalists, and leftist republicans to produce a magazine called\u00a0Homens Livres\u00a0(Free Men). Such prolific intellectual activity had its costs. By the end of his life, Sardinha\u2019s disciples were divided between those who supported authoritarian policies and those who wanted the implementation of true integralist policies. While recognizing Sardinha as a mentor,\u00a0Alfredo Pimenta\u00a0and\u00a0Caetano Beir\u00e3o, for example, quickly recognized Salazar and his conservative authoritarianism as a valid alternative. When the First Republic finally perished, giving way to the\u00a0Estado Novo\u00a0in 1926, despite frequently becoming the targets of censorship many integralists became staunch defenders of the new regime. Sardinha and the\u00a0Estado Novo We will never know if Sardinha, who died in 1925, would have been supportive of Salazar\u2019s\u00a0Estado Novo. He was certainly enthusiastic about many of the achievements and methods of Mussolini\u2019s Italian fascism, going so far as calling the Italian experience a \u2018fulfillment\u2019 of his own theories. However,\u00a0Alberto Monsaraz,\u00a0Jos\u00e9 Adriano Pequito Rebelo,\u00a0Jos\u00e9 Hip\u00f3lito Raposo, and\u00a0Francisco Rol\u00e3o Preto\u00a0\u2014 some of the most prominent successors of Sardinha in the leadership of the\u00a0Integralismo Lusitano\u00a0\u2014 would eventually come to criticize the\u00a0Estado Novo\u2019s institutions as mere formalities. These integralists were, in fact, the first victims of political persecution and censorship during the first years of the\u00a0Estado Novo, much more so than the republican left. Sardinha and his integralism envisioned parliamentary institutions that could represent citizens based on their regions and professions. He endorsed a corporatist chamber akin to that which had already been endorsed by many of the authors inspired by Catholic social teaching. To them, both the Portuguese\u00a0Estado Novo\u00a0and Italy\u2019s fascist state seemed to have failed in the creation of autonomous legislative bodies that could function without the guidance of partisan leaders like Mussolini or Salazar.  From what we know of Sardinha\u2019s methodical line of thought, this is a perversion of the\u00a0true\u00a0aim of such institutions \u2014 which is to function normally, as vigorous bulwarks of local, regional, and national traditions and independence. It thus would have been entirely unacceptable to him. Sardinha respected his country\u2019s institutions too much to settle for watching them becoming a mere tool for Salazar\u2019s projects. While not so important to Sardinha in his later years, even the failure to reinstate the monarchy only proved that, despite the fact that\u00a0Integralismo Lusitano\u00a0had formed and educated most of the political elites of the early stages of\u00a0Estado Novo,\u00a0the regime was ultimately a betrayal of Sardinha\u2019s teachings. Salazar\u2019s\u00a0Estado Novo\u00a0functioned under the premise of a \u2018normal existence.\u2019 However, there was nothing normal in the\u00a0Estado Novo\u2019s institutions. In 1970, In 1974, four years after the dictator\u2019s death, the\u00a0Estado Novo\u00a0would fall to a poorly organized coup d\u2019\u00e9tat without any type of relevant resistance on the behalf of its institutions. Sardinha dreamed of an Integralist Regime that could, like the traditional constitution of the Portuguese monarchy, withstand the passing of the ages, the incompetence of kings and rulers, and even the decadence of the national community. Instead, Salazar\u2019s\u00a0Estado Novo\u00a0\u2014 much like Mussolini\u2019s\u00a0Stato fascista\u00a0\u2014 fell as soon as its leader disappeared. Manuel Rezende\u00a0is a writer based in Porto.

                "text": "Timothy Jay Schwab's new book \"The Search For King Solomon's Treasure\" is such \"a\u00a0farrago of nonsense\u00a0that is contravened by a multitude of eyewitness accounts, inconvenient facts, and simple common sense,\"\u00a0that I was not able to cover it all in my initial review. This time around I want to take a look at some of the outright absurdities in Tim's book. Things that simply do not belong but which make up \"The Monumental Case For the Philippines No One Can Disprove.\" Each page is a head scratching, \"Did he really write that?,\" moment.\u00a0 Let's start off with something that Tim did not write. From the Foreward by \"Dr.\" Butch Belgica:  The accepted scientific way of determining the land of creation is biodiversity. Southeast Asia, as declared by science journals and hundreds of scientists, is the world center of biodiversity - marine, mammals, plants and animals - with the Philippines as the epicenter in all.\u00a0   p. 10  A word about The God Culture calling this a Foreward instead of a foreword. They claim that its a double entendre and the reason they use it can be found on page 9 of the book.  FYI - Someone asked why we chose the word Foreward with an A rather than the traditional Foreword with an O. Read Page 9 of Solomon's Treasure and we explain why Foreward is far more appropriate for our book as we employ a double entendre and it is intentional and on all our books that way. Yah Bless.   https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=698485840711436&id=376627072897316  There is nothing on page 9 to explain this word choice. As for it being a double entendre, I fail to see what is \"socially awkward, sexually suggestive, or offensive\" here. The correct word for this type of speech\u00a0would\u00a0be a pun. The claim Belgica makes about biodiversity determining the land of creation shows up later in the book on page 64 where Tim writes the following:  Mankind and animals rebooted during the Flood and are no firm scientific measure to determine the origin of species. \u00a0However, marine life was not wiped out by the deluge as such. Therefore, we have a credible measure by which to allocate the root of life in region. If we can locate the most bio-diverse population on earth, we would have actually found the Land of Creation scientifically. In the past twenty or so years, marine biologists have now determined that this center of life, without even actually realizing what they have found, is he measure of the origin of species. Sorry Charlie, Darwin that is. p.64-65  I hope my readers are astute enough to see what is wrong with these claims. For one thing they contradict each other. Belgica says biodiversity in toto can determine the land of creation. Tim says only marine biodiversity can determine the land of creation because everything else was wiped out by the flood. Though Tim does write about mammal diversity further on page 66 where he quotes a press release from Chicago's Field Museum. Where is the world's greatest concentration of unique species of mammals? A team of American and Filipino authors have concluded it is Luzon Island, in the Philippines.  This PRESS RELEASE goes on to reference a scientific study which Tim neglects to reference. Imagine writing a book that is supposed to be \"The Monumental Case For the Philippines No One Can Disprove\" and instead of analyzing a scientific paper you are satisfied with quoting from a press release as your source. \"Though this be madness, yet there is method in't.\" The method is to be as shallow as possible and we shall see it crop up several times in this book as Tim prefers to quote newspaper articles about studies rather than analyze any of the scientific studies to which they refer. Neither Belgica nor Tim explains how locating the center of biodiversity can scientifically lead us to the land of creation. They just assume it. They don't quote any scientists or offer any reasonable proof why the most biodiverse land is the land of creation. The Earth is a large planet and it could be that God created different animals in different lands and not all in one place. How does Tim explain the unique biodiversity of Australia or the Amazon rainforest? Noah's flood actually destroys Tim's thesis about marine biodiversity. Tim correctly notes that the fountains of the deep and the windows of heaven were opened during the flood. But if that is the case then all life in the sea would have been dispersed. If underground geysers were spouting up then they would spread abroad all they touch. Post-Flood there would be no center of marine biodiversity. This is especially case since Tim teaches there was no ocean before the flood. More on this below.\u00a0 First let's look a little closer at what Tim's three sources say this diversity consists. These are all found on page 65. \u00a0Source one is from\u00a0http://oneocean.org/flash/philippine_biodiversity.html.  The Philippines forms an ocean region that has long been recognized as the world\u2019s center of marine biodiversity. With the Malay archipelago, Papua New Guinea and Australia, the country forms the \u2018Coral Triangle,\u2019 so-called because of the abundance of its coral reef life. Some 400-500 species in 90 genera of reef-forming corals are believed to exist in this region. Sulu-Sulawesi Sea, a 900,000-square-kilometer marine eco-region that lies at the apex of the Coral Triangle (70% in the Philippines, 20% Indonesia, 10% Malaysia), is home to some 2,500 species of fish. A\u00a02005 report\u00a0(Carpenter 2005) suggests that the Philippines is not only part of the center but is, in fact, the epicenter of marine biodiversity, with the richest concentration of marine life on the entire planet.  That 2005 report is actually a little difficult to find but it can be read here:\u00a0  The center of the center of marine shore fish biodiversity: The Philippine Islands Analysis of distribution data for 2983 species reveals a pattern of richness on a finer scale and identifies a peak of marine biodiversity in the central Philippine Islands and a secondary peak between peninsular Malaysia and Sumatra. This pattern is repeated in diverse habitat and higher taxa classes, most rigorously for marine shore fishes, supporting geohistorical hypotheses as the most general unifying explanations.  Why is this report not the source Timothy uses? Because it does not fit his thesis. The title of this report is: \"The center of the center of marine shore fish biodiversity: The Philippine Islands.\"\u00a0The focus of this study is not\u00a0marine life in general but\u00a0shore fish in\u00a0particular! The other marine life which composes this diversity is mostly corals which form their habitat. But how exactly does this diversity prove that the Philippines is the land of creation? Tim does not say. He simply assumes it. The next source is\u00a0literally a Google search!!!   NOTE:\u00a0This\u00a0is an old search on Google from 4 years ago. CNN has since purged\u00a0his\u00a0report\u00a0and link but we\u00a0have\u00a0it\u00a0captured. Notice, it is also widely report by the Philippine Star, Manila Times, etc, Our route is taken from the CNN report but all are similar. We are keeping the one from our original video in which his was very widely circulated and quoted from CNN as you can see on this page.  If there is anything that can convict Timothy Jay Schwab of being a shameless fraud it has to be this. First of all this source is a Google search and not the actual article so he doesn't have it captured as he claims he has and if he does he should have used that instead of this malarkey. Second of all this CNN report is actually an ireport! The url is:\u00a0http://ireport.cnn.com/docs/DOCS-783629. CNN retired this feature in 2015. Ireports were akin to Wikipedia and thus unreliable. Anyone could report on anything. I do not have this article so I cannot read their sources but neither can Timothy. Third of all this is a GOOGLE SEARCH!!! It does not prove a thing. A fine source for Tim's \"Monumental Case For The Philippines No One Can Disprove.\" His third source is from a newspaper and is of no account.  Some 100 scientists have declared the Philippines as the world\u2019s \"center of marine biodiversity\" \u2014 not the Great Reef Barrier off east Australia \u2014 because of its vast species of marine and coastal resources, according to the World Bank.\u00a0   https://www.philstar.com/headlines/2006/06/08/340635/100-scientists-declare-rp-world146s-145center-marine-biodiversity146  That is sufficiently vague enough for Tim to prove his point and is not worth commenting on. Why not link to the World Bank study and explain exactly why the Philippines is the center of marine biodiversity? Why not tell us all more about this biodiversity and how it proves that the Philippines is the land of creation? Why is Tim content with newspapers and secondhand reports? Since Tim does not bother to link it I will not bother to search it out.\u00a0 Let's return to the first source. In that source the marine biodiversity is located in the Sulu Sea. But Tim does not believe there was a Sulu Sea when God created the Earth! He teaches that the oceans and seas were formed as a result of the flood.\u00a0  ....after the Flood with the new World Ocean formed... pg. 54 Prior to the Flood, the water system of the Earth was described as five mega-rivers with fountains of the great deep within. There is no mention of a world ocean.... pg. 269\u00a0  ...no ocean and a lot more land. pg. 271\u00a0  The implications of this teaching are obviously quite ridiculous. There would be no large bodies of water for the great whales to swim in. Imagine blue whales swimming in a river, even a mega-river. What is a mega-river anyway? Tim offers no precise explanation as to what they or how they would function.\u00a0 By the way those mega-rivers are now known to us as ocean trenches according to Tim. How does Tim know this? He doesn't he quotes again from an article about a study and jumps to the conclusion that these trenches must have been rivers before the Flood buried them.  \u201cIf you drained all the water away, it would look\u00a0exactly like a river system\u00a0with bends and meanders, except there are no trees along the banks...\u201d \u2013 Dan Parsons, PhD, Sedimentologist, University of Hull, UK to BBC News\u00a0(studies undersea rivers)   pg. 254-255 of the Sourcebook  Tim's source for the above quote is an interesting article at the BBC\u00a0from which Tim draws unwarranted conclusions and assumptions which he cannot prove. Has he studied these trenches with underwater excavations? Of course not. It also references a study Tim neglects. But that is par for the course. If there was no Sulu Sea then that means God did not create all marine life or an abundance of marine life in those waters. Instead where the Sulu Sea is now was the Garden of Eden. According to Tim the Garden of Eden is actually at the very bottom of the Sulu Sea. Tim thinks this scientifically proves the Philippines is the center of marine biodiversity.  As we covered before, the Carpenter Report, CNN, World Bank, and many others now record the Sulu Sea specifically the Verde island passage from Mindoro to Batangas as \"The Center of the Center of Marine Biodiversity on Earth\" and as we established, that indicates the origin of life on Earth not old bones of humans nor animals. Therefore, this even proves out scientifically as that is just above the Garden of Eden which is enclosed within the Earth. Somewhere to the East is an entrance and we do not claim to have found the entrance nor do we wish to attempt to enter. We believe we even find support in the Hebrew name if a large underwater reef famous for diving in the center of the Sulu Sea in fact just above the Garden. Tubbataha Reef Hebrew: Tub:\u00a0\u05d8\u05d5\u05bc\u05d1:\u00a0good things Hebrew: ba:\u00a0\u05d1\u05bc\u05b8\u05d0:\u00a0in the Hebrew: ta:\u00a0\u05ea\u05bc\u05b8\u05d0\u00a0:chamber Hebrew: ha:\u00a0\u05d4\u05d0:\u00a0The Our interpretation: The Good Things in the Chamber   To what chamber might this be referring? Perhaps the enclosed Garden of Eden just below. If this is coincidence, calculate the odds of such impossibility.   pg. 310-312  What nerve to claim he has covered the Carpenter report when that is not the case at all as I showed above. He does not even cite it!\u00a0   If the Garden of Eden is BELOW the Sulu Sea then that means God did not create the Sulu Sea during the seven days of creation. Therefore there will have to be an alternate explanation as to why there is so much diversity in the region. It cannot be because God created it so because the Sulu Sea did not begin to exist until AFTER the flood according to Tim's cosmology. Has Tim not thought this through?\u00a0   According to Wikipedia Tubbataha means: The word\u00a0tubbataha\u00a0is a combination of two\u00a0Sama-Bajau\u00a0words:\u00a0tubba\u00a0and\u00a0taha,\u00a0which together means \"a long reef exposed at low tide\".\u00a0   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tubbataha_Reef#Etymology  This is a good point to segue into Tim's use of Wikipedia.\u00a0Tim cites Wikipedia authoritatively in this book.\u00a0\u00a0 This further affirms the claim that the Philippines was mining gold in 1000 B.C. as...Wikipedia and others stake.   pg. 43  But on page 99 he shows why Wikipedia is not a reliable source:  ...someone has now changed that Wikipedia article... Wikipedia even tells us that it is not reliable as a primary source because it can be changed at any time! https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Wikipedia_is_not_a_reliable_sourceWe\u00a0advise special caution when using Wikipedia as a source for research projects. Normal academic usage of Wikipedia and other\u00a0encyclopedias\u00a0is for getting the general facts of a problem and to gather keywords, references and bibliographical pointers, but not as a source in itself. Remember that Wikipedia is a\u00a0wiki. Anyone in the world can edit an article, deleting accurate information or adding false information, which the reader may not recognize.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citing_Wikipedia  Tim would be wise to learn this lesson but as it stands Wikipedia is part of his \"Monumental Case For the Philippines No One Can Disprove.\" All it takes is a few edits and his case is disproven. The Garden of Eden is not the only thing the flood buried beneath the newly formed World Ocean. Lemuria and Atlantis also were buried in the deluge.  Many recall the fabled Lemuria. It is no sunken continent that disappeared into the sea. It was inundated and overcome by the new World Ocean as was Atlantis. If one desired to discover a treasure trove of prehistoric archaeology, they would need to penetrate into the Flood sediment there on the bottom and entire large societies would emerge. However, man has no such capabilities in this age. Is it not odd that the Flood buried this and Atlantis to such degrees that we cannot even locate them today? pg. 277  It is quite fitting that Tim writes about the existence of those fictional places in a book that is full of fictions about the Philippines. Apparently Tim is unaware that Plato invented Atlantis to illustrate his philosophical ideas and Lemuria was postulated in the 19th century by a zoologist to explain why \u00a0lemur fossils appeared in disparate places. Hence the name Lemuria. Any embellished accounts of Lemuria that Tim has read have most likely come from Theosophists such as Helena Blavatsky who made Lemuria a central part of her occult teachings. This passage is tainted with occult, new-age quackery. Speaking of occult, new-age quackery Zechariah Sitchin's work forms part of Tim's \"Monumental Case For the Philippines No One Can Disprove.\" He is the author of the famous Earth Chronicles series of books where he writes about ancient aliens visiting the earth and creating man.\u00a0  However, in the Book of Enki, the Nephilim also built an ark which landed on Turkey on their Mount of Salvation now called Ararat or near there. That's not Noah.   pg. 319  Is this some kind of joke? Is Tim for real? \u00a0Is he actually interpreting the Bible narrative of the flood through the Book of Enki which is about aliens who came to earth to mine for gold and genetically engineered mankind to be their slaves!!? Some 445,000 years ago, astronauts from another planet came to Earth in search of gold. Splashing down in one of Earth's seas, they waded ashore and established Eridu, \"Home in the Faraway.\" In time the initial settlement expanded to a full-fledged Mission Earth-with a Mission Control Center, a spaceport, mining operations, and even a way station on Mars. Short of manpower, the astronauts employed genetic engineering to fashion Primitive Workers-Homo sapiens. The Deluge that catastrophically swept over the Earth required a fresh start; the astronauts became gods, granting Mankind civilization, teaching it to worship. Then, about four thousand years ago, all that had been achieved unraveled in a nuclear calamity, brought about by the visitors to Earth in the course of their own rivalries and wars. What's next? \u00a0Will he discourse on Niburu and Planet X and how man was created by alien gods? All of that is in the Lost Book of Enki. This false and occult information makes it into the authoritative sourcebook on page 267 and is a solid part of his case. Mt. Ararat in Turkey has the wrong name, in the wrong direction, 12,000' too short, is not mountains but is the site where the Nephilim claim to have landed when they survived. At this point Tim has gone totally off the deep end into esoteric texts that have no basis as being true. It's no wonder he is not satisfied with using the Bible alone to prove his case because the Bible contradicts him on multiple points especially concerning the flood and the law.\u00a0 https://www.ophirinstitute.com/sources Strangely the Book of Enki is not listed as an official extra-biblical source.Guess what else forms part of Tim's \"Monumental Case For The Philippines No One Can Disprove.\" A rant against Oprah Winfrey! pg. 57We know media mogul, Oprah, would like to disparage Yahuah because He supposedly told Adam where the gold was which is complete ignorance as He never had to tell Adam where the gold was because Adam was created in the Land of Gold. It is the marker resource in identifying this region which is preserved to this day. Let us not pretend Oprah, as a billionaire is not serving Mammon (god of money) herself thus this \u00a0was a very hypocritical statement from her.  What is he talking about? Why is this in the book? What does this have to do with anything!? I tried to look this up and I think it has to do with her review of John Steinbeck's book East of Eden but I just don't know and since Tim does not tell us I'm not going to bother to search further. Parts of Tim's book are devoted to revealing the Philippines in prophecy. In fact revealing the Philippines' place in prophecy is actually the whole point of his book and videos. Did you know the fact that because no one in the Philippines trusts anyone else resulting in everyone's house being enclosed behind a wall to prevent thieves from barging in identifies the Philippines in the book of Ezekiel?Ezekiel 38:13 KJV\u00a0Sheba, and Dedan, and the merchants of Tarshish, with all the young lions thereof, shall say unto thee, Art thou come to take a spoil? hast thou gathered thy company to take a prey? to carry away silver and gold, to take away cattle and goods, to take a great spoil?Some focus on the young lions in this passage. \u00a0The word\u00a0\u05db\u05bc\u05b0\u05e4\u05b4\u05d9\u05e8: kephiyr is also defined \"village (as covered by walls)\" which the Philippines has walls or\u00a0concrete\u00a0especially fences everywhere. It is one of the first icons once notices when they visit there.pg. 77Commenting elsewhere on this verse Tim writes:Again, this is where some attempt to force Britain into this when it is interpreted \"young lions.\" However the word in Hebrew is also defined as \"a village covered by walls.\" Anyone visiting the Philippines quickly notices the entire nation is a walled village. Most properties are fenced in with large concrete walls or the like. This is a further fit to the rest of Isaiah's prophecies about the Philippines in context as Ezekiel knew as well the significance of this land. pg. 251Isaiah and Ezekiel were prophets to the nation of Israel. If we are to believe what Tim writes then these prophets were prophesying to the Israelites about a land and people they had no knowledge of and which would only figure in during the end times thousands of years in the future.. It's not that the Israelites had no knowledge of Sheba, Dedan, and Tarshish. Of course they knew those lands. But the Philippines lay far out of sight on the other side of the world.\u00a0 Tim is adamant that the island of Cebu is actually Sheba.Now that we know who is not the Queen of Sheba is there a way to pinpoint where she originated? We believe this can be accomplished by using the Hebrew language in her island for Sheba is in fact Cebu.pg. 84Following this paragraph is a long disputation using Hebrew words to ferret out the hidden meaning of Cebu. Tim says it is derived from the words \"shebu\" and \"sebu.\" Take note that linguistics is Tim's method to uncover Bible mysteries. Not archaeology or exploration. Instead of going to Cebu to hunt for the remains of such a splendid kingdom as Sheba must have been he sits in his computer chair and constructs fake etymologies based on similarity of sounds. Cebu originates from a Cebuano word meaning trade.The name \"Cebu\" came from the old\u00a0Cebuano\u00a0word\u00a0sibu\u00a0or\u00a0sibo\u00a0(\"trade\"), a shortened form of\u00a0sinibuayng hingpit\u00a0(\"the place for trading\"). It was originally applied to the harbors of the town of Sugbu, the ancient name for Cebu City. Sugbu or Sugbo, in turn, was derived from the Old Cebuano term for \"scorched earth\" or \"great fire\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cebu_City#EtymologyIdentifying the island of Cebu as the kingdom of Sheba is very problematic for Tim because when he maps out the Greek's alleged knowledge of the Philippines he points to only two mythical islands, Chryse and Argyre, as being Luzon and Mindanao respectively. But here he is telling us that the Queen of Sheba lived on Cebu island and that the Israelites were aware of this.Ophir had a brother named Sheba had a descended ruling his region in 970 B.C. who was visited by Solomon's navy in her land of Sheba...pg. 78-79If Solomon's navy actually landed in Cebu and the Greeks inherited the shipping routes of those Phoenician sailors as Tim claims they did then why is there no island corresponding to Cebu in any Greek description of the world? Are we to believe the Greeks knew about Luzon and Mindanao but forgot about Cebu? It makes no sense whatsoever. It is more evidence against Tim's erroneous postulations about the identity of the Philippines. The identity of Cebu as Sheba plays a large part in Tim's interpretation of Matthew 12:42 and is key to understanding what he believes about the role of Filipinos in the end times.Matthew 12:42 KJV (Parallel in Luke 11:30)\u00a0The queen of the south shall rise up in the judgment with this generation, and shall condemn\u00a0it: for she came from the uttermost parts of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon; and, behold, a greater than Solomon is here.The Queen of the South still remains a designation of Cebu and Iloilo to this day and she will rise up. This means Messiah knew she would be put down for a season. She will judge this generation which is the final generation as in the passage, He defines this era where people will be seven more times demon possessed. Who came to hear the wisdom of Solomon? The Queen of Sheba. This is the Philippines which ascends to a position on the world amphitheater . It ill have a say in the judgement of the world and it's hierarchy. this is significant. We believe we are already beginning to witness the grass roots moment which will lead to this fulfillment. Ezekiel confirms the timing as Sheba, Tarshish and DDN, Philippines will rise up early in the narrative not at the end.pg. 252Tim interprets this passage to be a prophecy that the Philippines, personified as the Queen of the South, will rise up in the end times, reestablish God's law, and condemn the New World Order.These isles in the East will judge the New World Order and the final generation not on Judgement Day but now. In order to become a judge one must have an adherence to the law or they have no measure by which to judge. Wait til you find out Yahuah will restore His law in the archipelago. pg. 245That is really all nonsense. The problem with all this is to be found in the preceding verse of Matthew. It seems Tim has completely overlooked Matthew 12:41.Matthew 12:41\u00a0The men of Nineveh shall rise in judgment with this generation, and shall condemn it: because they repented at the preaching of Jonas; and, behold, a greater than Jonas is here.If Tim is going to be consistent then the nation of Iraq, which is where Nineveh is located, will also rise up and condemn the New World Order by restoring God's law. Of course that's not going to happen. Neither is the Philippines going to restore God's law for the law is a schoolmaster to lead us to Christ and Christ has come. The law is no more. That is the message of both Hebrews and Galatians. Tim's message that Filipinos will restore God's law is fundamentally anti-Christian. The simple message of Matthew 12 is that those people who demanded a sign from Jesus are condemned for not believing the miracles and signs already given. It is Jesus who is greater than Jonah and Solomon yet those wicked men refused to believe on Him without a sign to their liking while Jonah and Solomon were believed on even without signs. Therefore at the judgement day the Queen of Sheba and the Ninevites will rise up and condemn those wicked people for their unbelief. Why would Jesus, in the midst of condemning those people, give a prophecy about the Philippines in the end times? He wouldn't and he doesn't. In Tim's hand easy to understand Bible passages like that of Matthew 12 become complex and familiar stories like that of Jonah become strange and unfamiliar. We all know the Bible says God prepared a great fish to swallow Jonah but Tim thinks it was actually Leviathan.Jonah\u00a01:17 KJVNow the LORD had prepared a great fish to swallow up Jonah. And Jonah was in the belly of the fish three days and three nights. We know in Sunday school we are told this was a whale. However, it says simply great fish. Whatever it was Jonah survived in it's belly for three days and nights. We have no hesitation in positing on a thought on this however. Science has proven a man could not likely survive in a whale's stomach and it leaves scholars with no answer. \u00a0So consider this as a theory on this side note. This would have to be a sea creature with the capacity for Jonah to breath while inside it's inners and large enough to support a man. This stumps the best of scholars if they are honest about it. Our theory is this may have been, and we cannot prove this, Leviathan, the great sea creature recorded in the Book of Job as living at the bottom of the sea but also breathing fire. This requires oxygen within his apparatus and he was massive in size thus it would make sense that Yahuah sent Leviathan to swallow Jonah. Again, we cannot prove that as we have yet to see Leviathan but it does make sense. pg. 121You got to give it to Timothy, that is some interesting out of the box thinking. Very creative. In one fell swoop he concocts a fantastical scenario he claims he cannot prove and he does away with the miraculous nature of the whole event by trying to get all scientific. When has science \"proven a man could not likely survive in a whale's stomach\" and why would it even matter? Apply that kind of thinking to the resurrection and you will soon become an atheist. As we saw above in Matthew 12:41 Jonah is a type, a prefiguring, of Jesus Christ. As Jonah was in the belly of the whale so Christ was in the heart of the earth. Jonah entered the belly of the whale, and Christ does use the Greek word for whale or great fish, after God, in His wrath, sent a storm. Leave it to Tim to take the miracle out of that part of Jonah's story as well. If Jonah was only headed to Spain or Britain, then he would have been swallowed in the Mediterranean Sea which is certainly not known for the severe tempests over the ocean like this. pg. 123It's hard to believe that Tim has missed the miraculous nature of the story of Jonah but there it is in his book. The fact is God sent a strong storm and as soon as Jonah was tossed overboard the storm immediately ceased. He was then swallowed, according to the Hebrew and Greek, by a great fish or whale and not the fire breathing serpent Leviathan. He survived in the belly of that fish for three days and then was vomited onto the shore. His survival was due solely to God's providence and direction of the entire event. There is nothing natural about the story of Jonah. It is all miraculous and it is all a prefiguring of the death, burial, and resurrection of Jesus Christ according to Matthew 12. Another familiar Bible story that Tim flips upside down is the story of the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil. Remember Adam and Eve were forbidden to eat from that tree or else they would die. It seems Tim thinks this prohibition was because the fruit was actually poisonous. The fruit was not an apple or a fig but lanzones. After quoting from the Book of Enoch which describes the fruit of the Tree of Wisdom Tim writes:Lanzones appears to be the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil in Enoch's description as it is a perfect fit in every way. Could there be such a history that Lanzones could be poison? Lanzones originates in the Tagalog word Lason for \"poison to morals or mind.\" This is perfectly fitting an very similar to the Hebrew \"Lashon\" which denotes essentially a poison tongue in some applications and even a golden wedge or bar in others tying to Ophir and Havilah. To the right, you will notice insets of the Carob and Lanzones Trees. Notice the leaves and branches revery similar as Enoch recorded. The Lanzones fruit certainly appears as grapes growing on a tree as described. Can we really say this? Well, we were not there but in reading Enoch's very obvious reference this does match. However, we are not the first to say so as Philippines legend concurs. It was purged of such poison but one must ask how this can possibly end up matching the Book of Enochpg. 316pg.317 He then quotes a Filipino legend about lanzones and writes the following conclusion:According to this oral legend passed through generations in Laguna, Lanzones was once known to be poison. Where might a legend like that derive? The Book of Enoch yet again? An angel removed the poison and the tree was good to eat after that. Of course, this is a legend and there is no need to verify the story as much as we realize, legends like this usually have some sort of basis in ancient events many times. In this case, this happens to match what Enoch was describing in the Book of Enoch. Thus, we believe there is a connection. pg. 318The portion Tim quotes from Enoch says nothing about the fruit being poisonous. He pulls that assumption out of the air and then digs into a local Filipino legend about lanzones once being poisonous. They are only safe to eat now because an angel removed the poison. Just as he did with Jonah Tim excises the supernatural elements in the story of the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil. The tree is no longer a unique tree but the humble lanzones tree. The reason God forbade Adam and Eve to eat from it was because it was poisonous. But somewhere down the line the poison was removed and now we can all partake of the fruit of the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil during the summer when the fruit is harvested and sold at the market. There are many other absurdities in this book but let's look at one more that has to do with Tim personally. \u00a0Twice in this book he claims he is part Native American.Though our leader who is of mixed Native American and European descent....... pg. 18 Some of this author's ancestors were Native American Indians who were all but wiped from the face of the Earth when they rebranded them as \"savages.\" pg. 252Why would information about Tim's genetic make-up be in a book which is \"The Monumental Case For the Philippines No One Can Disprove?\" It does not make any sense until you get to page 343.In history, red skin is considered that of Native American Indian or the Filipino.When have Filipinos ever been called Red Skins? Let's cut to the chase. Does Tim's face betray any Native American ancestry? How about his brother's face or his grandmother's face?  Those are all white people! If Tim has any Native American blood coursing through his veins it is an insignificant amount just like Senator Elizabeth Warren.\u00a0 The reason Tim stresses his Native American ancestry is because he wants his Filipino readers to think he is just like them. He has red skin, Filipinos have red skin, therefore they are the same. Except Tim is MORE EQUAL than Filipinos because Native Americans \"were all but wiped from the face of the Earth!\" Tim hails from a tribe of people who have been oppressed on a scale that outweighs anything that ever happened during the Spanish and American occupations of the Philippines. What we have here is a guy who loathes the fact that he is a White American man and is latching on to anything that can transform him into a persecuted minority. It might be the ultimate case of going native as Tim is attempting to paint himself as being not only genetically identical to Filipinos with red skin but also being a member of a people group that has been more oppressed than them. But it has nothing to do with the Philippines being Ophir so who cares? Why is it in the book??",

                "title": "The God Culture: Stuff the God Culture Writes, \"The Search For King Solomon's Treasure\"",
                "text": "Timothy Jay Schwab's new book \"The Search For King Solomon's Treasure\" is such \"a\u00a0farrago of nonsense\u00a0that is contravened by a multitude of eyewitness accounts, inconvenient facts, and simple common sense,\"\u00a0that I was not able to cover it all in my initial review. This time around I want to take a look at some of the outright absurdities in Tim's book. Things that simply do not belong but which make up \"The Monumental Case For the Philippines No One Can Disprove.\" Each page is a head scratching, \"Did he really write that?,\" moment.\u00a0 Let's start off with something that Tim did not write. From the Foreward by \"Dr.\" Butch Belgica:  The accepted scientific way of determining the land of creation is biodiversity. Southeast Asia, as declared by science journals and hundreds of scientists, is the world center of biodiversity - marine, mammals, plants and animals - with the Philippines as the epicenter in all.\u00a0   p. 10  A word about The God Culture calling this a Foreward instead of a foreword. They claim that its a double entendre and the reason they use it can be found on page 9 of the book.  FYI - Someone asked why we chose the word Foreward with an A rather than the traditional Foreword with an O. Read Page 9 of Solomon's Treasure and we explain why Foreward is far more appropriate for our book as we employ a double entendre and it is intentional and on all our books that way. Yah Bless.   https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=698485840711436&id=376627072897316  There is nothing on page 9 to explain this word choice. As for it being a double entendre, I fail to see what is \"socially awkward, sexually suggestive, or offensive\" here. The correct word for this type of speech\u00a0would\u00a0be a pun. The claim Belgica makes about biodiversity determining the land of creation shows up later in the book on page 64 where Tim writes the following:  Mankind and animals rebooted during the Flood and are no firm scientific measure to determine the origin of species. \u00a0However, marine life was not wiped out by the deluge as such. Therefore, we have a credible measure by which to allocate the root of life in region. If we can locate the most bio-diverse population on earth, we would have actually found the Land of Creation scientifically. In the past twenty or so years, marine biologists have now determined that this center of life, without even actually realizing what they have found, is he measure of the origin of species. Sorry Charlie, Darwin that is. p.64-65  I hope my readers are astute enough to see what is wrong with these claims. For one thing they contradict each other. Belgica says biodiversity in toto can determine the land of creation. Tim says only marine biodiversity can determine the land of creation because everything else was wiped out by the flood. Though Tim does write about mammal diversity further on page 66 where he quotes a press release from Chicago's Field Museum. Where is the world's greatest concentration of unique species of mammals? A team of American and Filipino authors have concluded it is Luzon Island, in the Philippines.  This PRESS RELEASE goes on to reference a scientific study which Tim neglects to reference. Imagine writing a book that is supposed to be \"The Monumental Case For the Philippines No One Can Disprove\" and instead of analyzing a scientific paper you are satisfied with quoting from a press release as your source. \"Though this be madness, yet there is method in't.\" The method is to be as shallow as possible and we shall see it crop up several times in this book as Tim prefers to quote newspaper articles about studies rather than analyze any of the scientific studies to which they refer. Neither Belgica nor Tim explains how locating the center of biodiversity can scientifically lead us to the land of creation. They just assume it. They don't quote any scientists or offer any reasonable proof why the most biodiverse land is the land of creation. The Earth is a large planet and it could be that God created different animals in different lands and not all in one place. How does Tim explain the unique biodiversity of Australia or the Amazon rainforest? Noah's flood actually destroys Tim's thesis about marine biodiversity. Tim correctly notes that the fountains of the deep and the windows of heaven were opened during the flood. But if that is the case then all life in the sea would have been dispersed. If underground geysers were spouting up then they would spread abroad all they touch. Post-Flood there would be no center of marine biodiversity. This is especially case since Tim teaches there was no ocean before the flood. More on this below.\u00a0 First let's look a little closer at what Tim's three sources say this diversity consists. These are all found on page 65. \u00a0Source one is from\u00a0http://oneocean.org/flash/philippine_biodiversity.html.  The Philippines forms an ocean region that has long been recognized as the world\u2019s center of marine biodiversity. With the Malay archipelago, Papua New Guinea and Australia, the country forms the \u2018Coral Triangle,\u2019 so-called because of the abundance of its coral reef life. Some 400-500 species in 90 genera of reef-forming corals are believed to exist in this region. Sulu-Sulawesi Sea, a 900,000-square-kilometer marine eco-region that lies at the apex of the Coral Triangle (70% in the Philippines, 20% Indonesia, 10% Malaysia), is home to some 2,500 species of fish. A\u00a02005 report\u00a0(Carpenter 2005) suggests that the Philippines is not only part of the center but is, in fact, the epicenter of marine biodiversity, with the richest concentration of marine life on the entire planet.  That 2005 report is actually a little difficult to find but it can be read here:\u00a0  The center of the center of marine shore fish biodiversity: The Philippine Islands Analysis of distribution data for 2983 species reveals a pattern of richness on a finer scale and identifies a peak of marine biodiversity in the central Philippine Islands and a secondary peak between peninsular Malaysia and Sumatra. This pattern is repeated in diverse habitat and higher taxa classes, most rigorously for marine shore fishes, supporting geohistorical hypotheses as the most general unifying explanations.  Why is this report not the source Timothy uses? Because it does not fit his thesis. The title of this report is: \"The center of the center of marine shore fish biodiversity: The Philippine Islands.\"\u00a0The focus of this study is not\u00a0marine life in general but\u00a0shore fish in\u00a0particular! The other marine life which composes this diversity is mostly corals which form their habitat. But how exactly does this diversity prove that the Philippines is the land of creation? Tim does not say. He simply assumes it. The next source is\u00a0literally a Google search!!!   NOTE:\u00a0This\u00a0is an old search on Google from 4 years ago. CNN has since purged\u00a0his\u00a0report\u00a0and link but we\u00a0have\u00a0it\u00a0captured. Notice, it is also widely report by the Philippine Star, Manila Times, etc, Our route is taken from the CNN report but all are similar. We are keeping the one from our original video in which his was very widely circulated and quoted from CNN as you can see on this page.  If there is anything that can convict Timothy Jay Schwab of being a shameless fraud it has to be this. First of all this source is a Google search and not the actual article so he doesn't have it captured as he claims he has and if he does he should have used that instead of this malarkey. Second of all this CNN report is actually an ireport! The url is:\u00a0http://ireport.cnn.com/docs/DOCS-783629. CNN retired this feature in 2015. Ireports were akin to Wikipedia and thus unreliable. Anyone could report on anything. I do not have this article so I cannot read their sources but neither can Timothy. Third of all this is a GOOGLE SEARCH!!! It does not prove a thing. A fine source for Tim's \"Monumental Case For The Philippines No One Can Disprove.\" His third source is from a newspaper and is of no account.  Some 100 scientists have declared the Philippines as the world\u2019s \"center of marine biodiversity\" \u2014 not the Great Reef Barrier off east Australia \u2014 because of its vast species of marine and coastal resources, according to the World Bank.\u00a0   https://www.philstar.com/headlines/2006/06/08/340635/100-scientists-declare-rp-world146s-145center-marine-biodiversity146  That is sufficiently vague enough for Tim to prove his point and is not worth commenting on. Why not link to the World Bank study and explain exactly why the Philippines is the center of marine biodiversity? Why not tell us all more about this biodiversity and how it proves that the Philippines is the land of creation? Why is Tim content with newspapers and secondhand reports? Since Tim does not bother to link it I will not bother to search it out.\u00a0 Let's return to the first source. In that source the marine biodiversity is located in the Sulu Sea. But Tim does not believe there was a Sulu Sea when God created the Earth! He teaches that the oceans and seas were formed as a result of the flood.\u00a0  ....after the Flood with the new World Ocean formed... pg. 54 Prior to the Flood, the water system of the Earth was described as five mega-rivers with fountains of the great deep within. There is no mention of a world ocean.... pg. 269\u00a0  ...no ocean and a lot more land. pg. 271\u00a0  The implications of this teaching are obviously quite ridiculous. There would be no large bodies of water for the great whales to swim in. Imagine blue whales swimming in a river, even a mega-river. What is a mega-river anyway? Tim offers no precise explanation as to what they or how they would function.\u00a0 By the way those mega-rivers are now known to us as ocean trenches according to Tim. How does Tim know this? He doesn't he quotes again from an article about a study and jumps to the conclusion that these trenches must have been rivers before the Flood buried them.  \u201cIf you drained all the water away, it would look\u00a0exactly like a river system\u00a0with bends and meanders, except there are no trees along the banks...\u201d \u2013 Dan Parsons, PhD, Sedimentologist, University of Hull, UK to BBC News\u00a0(studies undersea rivers)   pg. 254-255 of the Sourcebook  Tim's source for the above quote is an interesting article at the BBC\u00a0from which Tim draws unwarranted conclusions and assumptions which he cannot prove. Has he studied these trenches with underwater excavations? Of course not. It also references a study Tim neglects. But that is par for the course. If there was no Sulu Sea then that means God did not create all marine life or an abundance of marine life in those waters. Instead where the Sulu Sea is now was the Garden of Eden. According to Tim the Garden of Eden is actually at the very bottom of the Sulu Sea. Tim thinks this scientifically proves the Philippines is the center of marine biodiversity.  As we covered before, the Carpenter Report, CNN, World Bank, and many others now record the Sulu Sea specifically the Verde island passage from Mindoro to Batangas as \"The Center of the Center of Marine Biodiversity on Earth\" and as we established, that indicates the origin of life on Earth not old bones of humans nor animals. Therefore, this even proves out scientifically as that is just above the Garden of Eden which is enclosed within the Earth. Somewhere to the East is an entrance and we do not claim to have found the entrance nor do we wish to attempt to enter. We believe we even find support in the Hebrew name if a large underwater reef famous for diving in the center of the Sulu Sea in fact just above the Garden. Tubbataha Reef Hebrew: Tub:\u00a0\u05d8\u05d5\u05bc\u05d1:\u00a0good things Hebrew: ba:\u00a0\u05d1\u05bc\u05b8\u05d0:\u00a0in the Hebrew: ta:\u00a0\u05ea\u05bc\u05b8\u05d0\u00a0:chamber Hebrew: ha:\u00a0\u05d4\u05d0:\u00a0The Our interpretation: The Good Things in the Chamber   To what chamber might this be referring? Perhaps the enclosed Garden of Eden just below. If this is coincidence, calculate the odds of such impossibility.   pg. 310-312  What nerve to claim he has covered the Carpenter report when that is not the case at all as I showed above. He does not even cite it!\u00a0   If the Garden of Eden is BELOW the Sulu Sea then that means God did not create the Sulu Sea during the seven days of creation. Therefore there will have to be an alternate explanation as to why there is so much diversity in the region. It cannot be because God created it so because the Sulu Sea did not begin to exist until AFTER the flood according to Tim's cosmology. Has Tim not thought this through?\u00a0   According to Wikipedia Tubbataha means: The word\u00a0tubbataha\u00a0is a combination of two\u00a0Sama-Bajau\u00a0words:\u00a0tubba\u00a0and\u00a0taha,\u00a0which together means \"a long reef exposed at low tide\".\u00a0   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tubbataha_Reef#Etymology  This is a good point to segue into Tim's use of Wikipedia.\u00a0Tim cites Wikipedia authoritatively in this book.\u00a0\u00a0 This further affirms the claim that the Philippines was mining gold in 1000 B.C. as...Wikipedia and others stake.   pg. 43  But on page 99 he shows why Wikipedia is not a reliable source:  ...someone has now changed that Wikipedia article... Wikipedia even tells us that it is not reliable as a primary source because it can be changed at any time! https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Wikipedia_is_not_a_reliable_sourceWe\u00a0advise special caution when using Wikipedia as a source for research projects. Normal academic usage of Wikipedia and other\u00a0encyclopedias\u00a0is for getting the general facts of a problem and to gather keywords, references and bibliographical pointers, but not as a source in itself. Remember that Wikipedia is a\u00a0wiki. Anyone in the world can edit an article, deleting accurate information or adding false information, which the reader may not recognize.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citing_Wikipedia  Tim would be wise to learn this lesson but as it stands Wikipedia is part of his \"Monumental Case For the Philippines No One Can Disprove.\" All it takes is a few edits and his case is disproven. The Garden of Eden is not the only thing the flood buried beneath the newly formed World Ocean. Lemuria and Atlantis also were buried in the deluge.  Many recall the fabled Lemuria. It is no sunken continent that disappeared into the sea. It was inundated and overcome by the new World Ocean as was Atlantis. If one desired to discover a treasure trove of prehistoric archaeology, they would need to penetrate into the Flood sediment there on the bottom and entire large societies would emerge. However, man has no such capabilities in this age. Is it not odd that the Flood buried this and Atlantis to such degrees that we cannot even locate them today? pg. 277  It is quite fitting that Tim writes about the existence of those fictional places in a book that is full of fictions about the Philippines. Apparently Tim is unaware that Plato invented Atlantis to illustrate his philosophical ideas and Lemuria was postulated in the 19th century by a zoologist to explain why \u00a0lemur fossils appeared in disparate places. Hence the name Lemuria. Any embellished accounts of Lemuria that Tim has read have most likely come from Theosophists such as Helena Blavatsky who made Lemuria a central part of her occult teachings. This passage is tainted with occult, new-age quackery. Speaking of occult, new-age quackery Zechariah Sitchin's work forms part of Tim's \"Monumental Case For the Philippines No One Can Disprove.\" He is the author of the famous Earth Chronicles series of books where he writes about ancient aliens visiting the earth and creating man.\u00a0  However, in the Book of Enki, the Nephilim also built an ark which landed on Turkey on their Mount of Salvation now called Ararat or near there. That's not Noah.   pg. 319  Is this some kind of joke? Is Tim for real? \u00a0Is he actually interpreting the Bible narrative of the flood through the Book of Enki which is about aliens who came to earth to mine for gold and genetically engineered mankind to be their slaves!!? Some 445,000 years ago, astronauts from another planet came to Earth in search of gold. Splashing down in one of Earth's seas, they waded ashore and established Eridu, \"Home in the Faraway.\" In time the initial settlement expanded to a full-fledged Mission Earth-with a Mission Control Center, a spaceport, mining operations, and even a way station on Mars. Short of manpower, the astronauts employed genetic engineering to fashion Primitive Workers-Homo sapiens. The Deluge that catastrophically swept over the Earth required a fresh start; the astronauts became gods, granting Mankind civilization, teaching it to worship. Then, about four thousand years ago, all that had been achieved unraveled in a nuclear calamity, brought about by the visitors to Earth in the course of their own rivalries and wars. What's next? \u00a0Will he discourse on Niburu and Planet X and how man was created by alien gods? All of that is in the Lost Book of Enki. This false and occult information makes it into the authoritative sourcebook on page 267 and is a solid part of his case. Mt. Ararat in Turkey has the wrong name, in the wrong direction, 12,000' too short, is not mountains but is the site where the Nephilim claim to have landed when they survived. At this point Tim has gone totally off the deep end into esoteric texts that have no basis as being true. It's no wonder he is not satisfied with using the Bible alone to prove his case because the Bible contradicts him on multiple points especially concerning the flood and the law.\u00a0 https://www.ophirinstitute.com/sources Strangely the Book of Enki is not listed as an official extra-biblical source.Guess what else forms part of Tim's \"Monumental Case For The Philippines No One Can Disprove.\" A rant against Oprah Winfrey! pg. 57We know media mogul, Oprah, would like to disparage Yahuah because He supposedly told Adam where the gold was which is complete ignorance as He never had to tell Adam where the gold was because Adam was created in the Land of Gold. It is the marker resource in identifying this region which is preserved to this day. Let us not pretend Oprah, as a billionaire is not serving Mammon (god of money) herself thus this \u00a0was a very hypocritical statement from her.  What is he talking about? Why is this in the book? What does this have to do with anything!? I tried to look this up and I think it has to do with her review of John Steinbeck's book East of Eden but I just don't know and since Tim does not tell us I'm not going to bother to search further. Parts of Tim's book are devoted to revealing the Philippines in prophecy. In fact revealing the Philippines' place in prophecy is actually the whole point of his book and videos. Did you know the fact that because no one in the Philippines trusts anyone else resulting in everyone's house being enclosed behind a wall to prevent thieves from barging in identifies the Philippines in the book of Ezekiel?Ezekiel 38:13 KJV\u00a0Sheba, and Dedan, and the merchants of Tarshish, with all the young lions thereof, shall say unto thee, Art thou come to take a spoil? hast thou gathered thy company to take a prey? to carry away silver and gold, to take away cattle and goods, to take a great spoil?Some focus on the young lions in this passage. \u00a0The word\u00a0\u05db\u05bc\u05b0\u05e4\u05b4\u05d9\u05e8: kephiyr is also defined \"village (as covered by walls)\" which the Philippines has walls or\u00a0concrete\u00a0especially fences everywhere. It is one of the first icons once notices when they visit there.pg. 77Commenting elsewhere on this verse Tim writes:Again, this is where some attempt to force Britain into this when it is interpreted \"young lions.\" However the word in Hebrew is also defined as \"a village covered by walls.\" Anyone visiting the Philippines quickly notices the entire nation is a walled village. Most properties are fenced in with large concrete walls or the like. This is a further fit to the rest of Isaiah's prophecies about the Philippines in context as Ezekiel knew as well the significance of this land. pg. 251Isaiah and Ezekiel were prophets to the nation of Israel. If we are to believe what Tim writes then these prophets were prophesying to the Israelites about a land and people they had no knowledge of and which would only figure in during the end times thousands of years in the future.. It's not that the Israelites had no knowledge of Sheba, Dedan, and Tarshish. Of course they knew those lands. But the Philippines lay far out of sight on the other side of the world.\u00a0 Tim is adamant that the island of Cebu is actually Sheba.Now that we know who is not the Queen of Sheba is there a way to pinpoint where she originated? We believe this can be accomplished by using the Hebrew language in her island for Sheba is in fact Cebu.pg. 84Following this paragraph is a long disputation using Hebrew words to ferret out the hidden meaning of Cebu. Tim says it is derived from the words \"shebu\" and \"sebu.\" Take note that linguistics is Tim's method to uncover Bible mysteries. Not archaeology or exploration. Instead of going to Cebu to hunt for the remains of such a splendid kingdom as Sheba must have been he sits in his computer chair and constructs fake etymologies based on similarity of sounds. Cebu originates from a Cebuano word meaning trade.The name \"Cebu\" came from the old\u00a0Cebuano\u00a0word\u00a0sibu\u00a0or\u00a0sibo\u00a0(\"trade\"), a shortened form of\u00a0sinibuayng hingpit\u00a0(\"the place for trading\"). It was originally applied to the harbors of the town of Sugbu, the ancient name for Cebu City. Sugbu or Sugbo, in turn, was derived from the Old Cebuano term for \"scorched earth\" or \"great fire\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cebu_City#EtymologyIdentifying the island of Cebu as the kingdom of Sheba is very problematic for Tim because when he maps out the Greek's alleged knowledge of the Philippines he points to only two mythical islands, Chryse and Argyre, as being Luzon and Mindanao respectively. But here he is telling us that the Queen of Sheba lived on Cebu island and that the Israelites were aware of this.Ophir had a brother named Sheba had a descended ruling his region in 970 B.C. who was visited by Solomon's navy in her land of Sheba...pg. 78-79If Solomon's navy actually landed in Cebu and the Greeks inherited the shipping routes of those Phoenician sailors as Tim claims they did then why is there no island corresponding to Cebu in any Greek description of the world? Are we to believe the Greeks knew about Luzon and Mindanao but forgot about Cebu? It makes no sense whatsoever. It is more evidence against Tim's erroneous postulations about the identity of the Philippines. The identity of Cebu as Sheba plays a large part in Tim's interpretation of Matthew 12:42 and is key to understanding what he believes about the role of Filipinos in the end times.Matthew 12:42 KJV (Parallel in Luke 11:30)\u00a0The queen of the south shall rise up in the judgment with this generation, and shall condemn\u00a0it: for she came from the uttermost parts of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon; and, behold, a greater than Solomon is here.The Queen of the South still remains a designation of Cebu and Iloilo to this day and she will rise up. This means Messiah knew she would be put down for a season. She will judge this generation which is the final generation as in the passage, He defines this era where people will be seven more times demon possessed. Who came to hear the wisdom of Solomon? The Queen of Sheba. This is the Philippines which ascends to a position on the world amphitheater . It ill have a say in the judgement of the world and it's hierarchy. this is significant. We believe we are already beginning to witness the grass roots moment which will lead to this fulfillment. Ezekiel confirms the timing as Sheba, Tarshish and DDN, Philippines will rise up early in the narrative not at the end.pg. 252Tim interprets this passage to be a prophecy that the Philippines, personified as the Queen of the South, will rise up in the end times, reestablish God's law, and condemn the New World Order.These isles in the East will judge the New World Order and the final generation not on Judgement Day but now. In order to become a judge one must have an adherence to the law or they have no measure by which to judge. Wait til you find out Yahuah will restore His law in the archipelago. pg. 245That is really all nonsense. The problem with all this is to be found in the preceding verse of Matthew. It seems Tim has completely overlooked Matthew 12:41.Matthew 12:41\u00a0The men of Nineveh shall rise in judgment with this generation, and shall condemn it: because they repented at the preaching of Jonas; and, behold, a greater than Jonas is here.If Tim is going to be consistent then the nation of Iraq, which is where Nineveh is located, will also rise up and condemn the New World Order by restoring God's law. Of course that's not going to happen. Neither is the Philippines going to restore God's law for the law is a schoolmaster to lead us to Christ and Christ has come. The law is no more. That is the message of both Hebrews and Galatians. Tim's message that Filipinos will restore God's law is fundamentally anti-Christian. The simple message of Matthew 12 is that those people who demanded a sign from Jesus are condemned for not believing the miracles and signs already given. It is Jesus who is greater than Jonah and Solomon yet those wicked men refused to believe on Him without a sign to their liking while Jonah and Solomon were believed on even without signs. Therefore at the judgement day the Queen of Sheba and the Ninevites will rise up and condemn those wicked people for their unbelief. Why would Jesus, in the midst of condemning those people, give a prophecy about the Philippines in the end times? He wouldn't and he doesn't. In Tim's hand easy to understand Bible passages like that of Matthew 12 become complex and familiar stories like that of Jonah become strange and unfamiliar. We all know the Bible says God prepared a great fish to swallow Jonah but Tim thinks it was actually Leviathan.Jonah\u00a01:17 KJVNow the LORD had prepared a great fish to swallow up Jonah. And Jonah was in the belly of the fish three days and three nights. We know in Sunday school we are told this was a whale. However, it says simply great fish. Whatever it was Jonah survived in it's belly for three days and nights. We have no hesitation in positing on a thought on this however. Science has proven a man could not likely survive in a whale's stomach and it leaves scholars with no answer. \u00a0So consider this as a theory on this side note. This would have to be a sea creature with the capacity for Jonah to breath while inside it's inners and large enough to support a man. This stumps the best of scholars if they are honest about it. Our theory is this may have been, and we cannot prove this, Leviathan, the great sea creature recorded in the Book of Job as living at the bottom of the sea but also breathing fire. This requires oxygen within his apparatus and he was massive in size thus it would make sense that Yahuah sent Leviathan to swallow Jonah. Again, we cannot prove that as we have yet to see Leviathan but it does make sense. pg. 121You got to give it to Timothy, that is some interesting out of the box thinking. Very creative. In one fell swoop he concocts a fantastical scenario he claims he cannot prove and he does away with the miraculous nature of the whole event by trying to get all scientific. When has science \"proven a man could not likely survive in a whale's stomach\" and why would it even matter? Apply that kind of thinking to the resurrection and you will soon become an atheist. As we saw above in Matthew 12:41 Jonah is a type, a prefiguring, of Jesus Christ. As Jonah was in the belly of the whale so Christ was in the heart of the earth. Jonah entered the belly of the whale, and Christ does use the Greek word for whale or great fish, after God, in His wrath, sent a storm. Leave it to Tim to take the miracle out of that part of Jonah's story as well. If Jonah was only headed to Spain or Britain, then he would have been swallowed in the Mediterranean Sea which is certainly not known for the severe tempests over the ocean like this. pg. 123It's hard to believe that Tim has missed the miraculous nature of the story of Jonah but there it is in his book. The fact is God sent a strong storm and as soon as Jonah was tossed overboard the storm immediately ceased. He was then swallowed, according to the Hebrew and Greek, by a great fish or whale and not the fire breathing serpent Leviathan. He survived in the belly of that fish for three days and then was vomited onto the shore. His survival was due solely to God's providence and direction of the entire event. There is nothing natural about the story of Jonah. It is all miraculous and it is all a prefiguring of the death, burial, and resurrection of Jesus Christ according to Matthew 12. Another familiar Bible story that Tim flips upside down is the story of the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil. Remember Adam and Eve were forbidden to eat from that tree or else they would die. It seems Tim thinks this prohibition was because the fruit was actually poisonous. The fruit was not an apple or a fig but lanzones. After quoting from the Book of Enoch which describes the fruit of the Tree of Wisdom Tim writes:Lanzones appears to be the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil in Enoch's description as it is a perfect fit in every way. Could there be such a history that Lanzones could be poison? Lanzones originates in the Tagalog word Lason for \"poison to morals or mind.\" This is perfectly fitting an very similar to the Hebrew \"Lashon\" which denotes essentially a poison tongue in some applications and even a golden wedge or bar in others tying to Ophir and Havilah. To the right, you will notice insets of the Carob and Lanzones Trees. Notice the leaves and branches revery similar as Enoch recorded. The Lanzones fruit certainly appears as grapes growing on a tree as described. Can we really say this? Well, we were not there but in reading Enoch's very obvious reference this does match. However, we are not the first to say so as Philippines legend concurs. It was purged of such poison but one must ask how this can possibly end up matching the Book of Enochpg. 316pg.317 He then quotes a Filipino legend about lanzones and writes the following conclusion:According to this oral legend passed through generations in Laguna, Lanzones was once known to be poison. Where might a legend like that derive? The Book of Enoch yet again? An angel removed the poison and the tree was good to eat after that. Of course, this is a legend and there is no need to verify the story as much as we realize, legends like this usually have some sort of basis in ancient events many times. In this case, this happens to match what Enoch was describing in the Book of Enoch. Thus, we believe there is a connection. pg. 318The portion Tim quotes from Enoch says nothing about the fruit being poisonous. He pulls that assumption out of the air and then digs into a local Filipino legend about lanzones once being poisonous. They are only safe to eat now because an angel removed the poison. Just as he did with Jonah Tim excises the supernatural elements in the story of the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil. The tree is no longer a unique tree but the humble lanzones tree. The reason God forbade Adam and Eve to eat from it was because it was poisonous. But somewhere down the line the poison was removed and now we can all partake of the fruit of the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil during the summer when the fruit is harvested and sold at the market. There are many other absurdities in this book but let's look at one more that has to do with Tim personally. \u00a0Twice in this book he claims he is part Native American.Though our leader who is of mixed Native American and European descent....... pg. 18 Some of this author's ancestors were Native American Indians who were all but wiped from the face of the Earth when they rebranded them as \"savages.\" pg. 252Why would information about Tim's genetic make-up be in a book which is \"The Monumental Case For the Philippines No One Can Disprove?\" It does not make any sense until you get to page 343.In history, red skin is considered that of Native American Indian or the Filipino.When have Filipinos ever been called Red Skins? Let's cut to the chase. Does Tim's face betray any Native American ancestry? How about his brother's face or his grandmother's face?  Those are all white people! If Tim has any Native American blood coursing through his veins it is an insignificant amount just like Senator Elizabeth Warren.\u00a0 The reason Tim stresses his Native American ancestry is because he wants his Filipino readers to think he is just like them. He has red skin, Filipinos have red skin, therefore they are the same. Except Tim is MORE EQUAL than Filipinos because Native Americans \"were all but wiped from the face of the Earth!\" Tim hails from a tribe of people who have been oppressed on a scale that outweighs anything that ever happened during the Spanish and American occupations of the Philippines. What we have here is a guy who loathes the fact that he is a White American man and is latching on to anything that can transform him into a persecuted minority. It might be the ultimate case of going native as Tim is attempting to paint himself as being not only genetically identical to Filipinos with red skin but also being a member of a people group that has been more oppressed than them. But it has nothing to do with the Philippines being Ophir so who cares? Why is it in the book??",

Peace lets the smallest of us have a voice. \n\n\n\nFrom a hello and pronouncing your friend\u2019s name correctly to giving more than you take and saying I\u2019m sorry, this simple concept book explores definitions of peace and actions small and big that foster it.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAward-winning authors, Baptiste Paul and Miranda Paul, have teamed up with illustrator Estel\u00ed Meza\u2014winner of the \u2018A la Orilla del Viento\u2019 the premier Picture Book Contest Award in Mexico\u2014to create an inspiring look at things we can all do to bring peace into our lives and world.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMY REVIEW:  \n\n\n\nPEACE \u2013 The title says it all. \n\n\n\nThis wonderfully illustrated children\u2019s book is written by the husband and wife social justice team of Baptiste and Miranda Paul.  \n\n\n\nBaptiste and Miranda Paul \n\n\n\nPeace is defined in simple terms that any child will be able to apply to their own lives.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe authors encourage children to demonstrate and seek peace through their own actions. For instance: kids are prompted to be polite and respectful. They are told that peace is giving more than they take which is a mantra that adults and children alike should strive to achieve.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe whimsical illustrations are beautiful and exquisite. Bold colors are liberally used to draw the eye across the pages. Each two-page spread is so fantastic they are worthy of being framed and hung in a child\u2019s bedroom or playroom.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI am rating PEACE as 5 OUT OF 5 STARS  and I hope to see copies of this book in houses, libraries and schools around the world.  \n\n\n\nGerman version \n\n\n\nSpanish version \n\n\n\nAt the same time as the English language version is being published, so to are the Spanish and German versions. \n\n\n\n*** Thank you to NetGalley for providing me with a free copy of this book. *** \n\n\n\nThe Authors \n\n\n\nABOUT THE AUTHORS:  \n\n\n\nABOUT BAPTISTE PAUL:  \n\n\n\nBaptiste Paul \n\n\n\nBaptiste Paul grew up in St. Lucia, where at age seven he propagated a root cutting that still produces breadfruit for his family. \n\n\n\nHe holds an Environmental Science degree and is the author of The Field, which received multiple starred reviews.

The third King of Israel, Solomon was a renowned ruler that oversaw growth from a single state into a venerable superpower of the Middle East in biblical times. During his near four-decade regency, he had a reputation for wisdom and clear judgment. But King Solomon had another aspect to his legend: his immense wealth from gold that historians say came from the lost mine of Ophir. This brings us to one of the great mysteries of all times that nobody can seem to agree on. Where was Ophir? \n\n\n\nKing Solomon\u2019s gold valued at more than $60 trillion. Here, King Solomon\u2019s palace\u00a0with\u00a0his golden throne. Source: jw.org. \n\n\n\nAnd the navy also of Hiram, that brought gold from Ophir, brought in from Ophir great plenty of sandal-wood and precious stones.The Bible 1 Kings 10:11 \n\n\n\nWhere Did the Gold Come From?\n\n\n\nBy today\u2019s standards, Solomon was reputed to have a personal fortune in excess of $60 trillion. Much of this came in the form of pure gold. By the end of his sovereignty, estimations indicated that he owned 500 tons of gold. Modern gold usually comes in the form of bullion. But King Solomon used a portion of his gold to fashion items such as shields, cups, and plates. \n\n\n\nKing Solomon\u2019s temple, built in the mid 10th century BCE, was bedecked in gold. At his palace, builders constructed his throne from a combination of gold and other precious material, ivory. A gold footstool rested at its base. Leading up to his golden throne, a dozen life-size replicas of lions formed a guard of honor on six steps. Related: \n\n\n\nUnfortunately for historians, the Bible never went into specific detail about King Solomon\u2019s mine of Ophir. There was never a specific record of its location: only general clues that could pertain to a number of places. Scholars believe that Solomon worked with another regent, Phoenician King Hiram, to acquire vast quantities of gold. Hiram ruled a region known at the time as Tyre, which is believed to be located within modern-day Lebanon. \n\n\n\nThe Phoenicians were renowned sailors and established several outposts throughout the Mediterranean sea. Some also say that part of this commerce extended into the Atlantic and Indian Oceans, perhaps even as far south as Africa. Because the Phoenicians traveled extensively, the exact location of this fabled source of gold is open to interpretation. \n\n\n\nMap of biblical times showing the supposed location of Ophir. Source: Unknown. \n\n\n\nPossible Locations of King Solomon\u2019s Mines\n\n\n\nThere are several theories on the location of King Solomon\u2019s mines, some more credible than others. Archaeologists have found copper mines in Isreal and Jordan. They have claimed that those were really King Solomon\u2019s mines and the source of his wealth. However, the search still continues for lack of conclusive evidence. \n\n\n\nAfrica\n\n\n\nTom\u00e9 Lopes is best known today for being the scrivener to the famed Portuguese explorer, Vasco de Gama. Lopes proposed that Ophir was an original, certainly ancient, name for Great Zimbabwe. During the Renaissance period, this was the central hub of all trade in African gold. Archaeologists have dated the ruins in this region to the medieval era, and they cannot possibly derive from Solomon at all. \n\n\n\nGreat Zimbabwe ruins. This area is known for is ancient mining civilization. Source: Wiki Commons, public domain. \n\n\n\nAlternatives to this suggestion have some scholars convinced that Ophir can be found along the coastline of the Red Sea, likely in Ethiopia. A tribe in Ethiopia is known as the Afar people. This is a predominantly Muslim tribe that number at more than a million. Others dispute this and say a much more plausible location for Ophir is in modern-day Tunisia \u2013 home to the Afri people. Afri was a Latin name given to the Carthaginians and this tribe could have origins stemming from Libya. The name also supposedly relates\u00a0with the Phoenicians as well. \n\n\n\nAsia\n\n\n\nThe Dravidians were very well-known for their gold, ivory, and precious gemstones. In ancient times, sandalwood was exclusive to South India, where the Dravidians were said to have originated. Historians support this conclusion by the belief that certain words in certain areas have a common root origin in the Hebrew Bible. There was another claim in 1897 that links the Coptic name for India, Sophir, to the Indian river Cophen. This is also often associated with parts of Afghanistan. \n\n\n\nThe author of a Spanish book called Colecci\u00f3n General de Documentos Relativos a las Islas Filipinas (General Collection of Philippine Islands related Documents), describes the method required to find Ophir. The section \u2018Document No. 98, written between 1519-22, Ophir can be found by first traveling from the Cape of Good Hope to India. From there onto Burma, Sumatra, then Moluccas, Borneo, Sulu and then China. According to this claim, Ophir exists in front of China towards the sea and many islands. This would rule out Japan and Taiwan as options and make the Philippines a more viable option. \n\n\n\nThe Americas\n\n\n\nApproximately 50 years after the Colecci\u00f3n General de Documentos Relativos a las Islas Filipinas was published, Benito Arias Montano suggested that native Peruvians were descendants of the Ophir tribes. He believed that the Yucatan province shared a name with the father of Ophir, Ioktan. Supporters of the pre-Columbian connections between Eurasia and South America dispute the notion of Peru in favor of Brazil. \n\n\n\nAll of these suggestions really stem from the personal beliefs of the authors in question. There are few hard facts to validate any claim. One of the few facts revealed in the pages of the Bible was that every voyage to find Ophir began in the same place: the Red Sea port of Ezion Geber. It wasn\u2019t only gold that came to Israel from Ophir. There were accounts and records of peacocks, apes, spices, and sandalwood. \n\n\n\nLost in Translation\n\n\n\nThe Bible from Hebrew to Greek\n\n\n\nThere are those that believe the true location of the Ophir mine may still exist in ancient texts. Somehow along the way, the original name evolved with mistranslations. The Bible was originally written in Hebrew and was translated into Greek. It was further translated into Latin and eventually into English. In Greek, the name Ophir has origins from the word Ophis, which means \u2018serpent\u2019. As the Hebrew word for serpent is \u2018Saraph\u2019, it is more likely that Ophir was a location that the Hebrews named, and not the Greeks. Experts even question the ivory, apes, and peacocks, as they too may be incorrect translations. \n\n\n\nStudies of the Hebrew Bible reveal an interesting fact. Apparently, round trips to Ophir took three years. Wherever it is, it may not have been close to Ezion Gerber. Ships that left port would need to pass the Arabian Sea and into the Indian Ocean. Ophir should really exist somewhere within this body of water. \n\n\n\nThe original Hebrew text of the Bible borrowed heavily from Tamil wording. The Tamil language has one word, Ovar, that has multiple meanings. Thus, Ovar can refer to artists and skilled craftsmen and artisans among others. Some say these people came from a place the ancients knew as Oviyar Nadu. The name shortened to Oviyar. Sailors foreign to the land might have suffered problems with that pronunciation and simply used Ovar instead. Ovar was a name adopted by the seaport in the northwestern coast of Ilanka. \n\n\n\nIlanka has had\u00a0many names down the centuries. Perhaps the best known of these is Ceylon. After gaining independence from Britain, Ceylon became known as Sri Lanka. Sri Lanka is an island found in the Indian Ocean with heavy Tamil influence and known for its peacocks. \n\n\n\nAnswers to the Ancient Mystery\n\n\n\nAlthough many archeologists claimed to have found the lost mine of Ophir, there has been no conclusive evidence. If someone does indeed find the ancient mine, chances are that no gold\u00a0remains. Perhaps this is not the point. However, one can argue that in this case, the speculation and wonder are probably more intriguing than the actual find would be. Until then, we\u2019ll keep searching\u2026just in case.",

The first history of Gibraltar was written in the 17thcentury, by a Gibraltarian, Alonso Hernandez del Portillo. He obviously had difficulty in finding a publisher, because his Historia de Gibraltar was not published in book form until nearly four centuries later. The manuscript was lost and then found again, and was used extensively by the author of the second Spanish history of Gibraltar, Ignacio Lopez de Ayala. Portillo\u2019s book has much of interest, especially when he writes about times which were recent for him. However, when he writes about Gibraltar in antiquity, he lapses into fantasy. His view of history was that, if anything happened anywhere within a thousand miles of the Rock, it must have happened right here.  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In the 18thcentury books in English began to appear. The first to deal exclusively with the history of Gibraltar and its area was The History of the Herculean Straits by Col. Thomas James. James, who had served in Gibraltar twenty years earlier, gives a comprehensive account of Gibraltar and nearby towns on the Straits, and a long, if not always accurate, account of the Rock\u2019s history.  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Great Siege of 1779-1783 gave rise to a number of accounts of the siege, some by people who lived through it. The most famous of them, by John Drinkwater, includes an account of the history of Gibraltar.  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Ayala\u2019s Historia de Gibraltar appeared in 1782 \u2013 a nice bit of opportunism, or \u2018instant journlism\u2019, as Gibraltar was very much in the public eye at the time, with the Great Siege still in progress. This book relies heavily on Portillo\u2019s manuscript for the early history of the Rock, and on the author\u2019s prejudices for his account of contemporary events. In 1845, James Bell, a Gibraltarian, translated Ayala\u2019s book, into English and brought it up to date.  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Montero, a physician from San Roque, wrote his Historia de Gibraltar in 1860, and dedicated the profits to a fund for the orphans of the recent cholera epidemic. Just to confuse, a few years earlier a Spaniard with a similar name, Monti, had also produced his own Historia de Gibraltar.  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The next history in English, in 1862, was by Capt. Frederick Sayer, who had been Police Magistrate in Gibraltar. In 1870 Frederic Stephens produced A History of Gibraltar and its Sieges, which was\u00a0 innovative as it was illustrated with photographs, which were pasted in. The very rare luxury edition has 16 photographs, but the standard editions have four, or sometimes only one. The photographs were by J Mann, whose name appears on the title page, while the author\u2019s does not, so the authorship of the book is often attributed to him. A shorter version of this book, with the same title, was intended for children. It was very popular \u2013 it went through many editions in the next 40 years, and was much in use as a school prize.   \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Early editions of the Gibraltar Directory included a section on the history of the Rock.  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The first book on Gibraltar by an American, by Henry M Field, appeared in 1888, and included a section on its history.  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The first significant history of Gibraltar of the 20th century was Col. ER Kenyon\u2019s Gibraltar under Moor, Spaniard and Briton. This excellent book was first published as a book in 1911, with revised editions in 1933 and 1938. Kenyon was an officer in the Royal Engineers, and his book focuses on the architecture of Gibraltar in relation to its history. It is well illustrated with sepia photographs.  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It was not long before the first book on Gibraltar came out of Franco\u2019s Spain: Historia de Gibraltar by Jose Carlos de Luna (1944). This is a comprehensive and well-researched book, but predictably biased.  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 One of the first post-war books on Gibraltar in English was written by John D Stewart, who was Deputy Commissioner of Works on the Rock in the 1950s. Gibraltar, the Keystone is written in an entertaining style, but was unpopular in Gibraltar because the author thought that Gibraltarians should opt for Spanish citizenship. At about the same time, Rock of Contention by George Hills, appeared. This is a scholarly history of the Rock, but is heavily biased towards the Spanish side.  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In 1975, the late Dorothy Ellicott, pioneer woman politician and enthusiast for Gibraltar\u2019s heritage, wrote Our Gibraltar, a useful summary of Gibraltar history. It is an excellent book to read if you are new to the subject.  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Other histories have been written in the last few decades. Some of them are good, others are commissioned works by UK-based authors who show little or no feel for the Rock or its people, and their books are often full of ludicrous errors. As a recent reviewer remarked, they have been \u201cparachuted in\u201d to write a book.  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This cannot be said for Sir William Jackson\u2019s The Rock of the Gibraltarians (1987) The author was one of our most popular Governors, and showed a real interest and feeling for the Rock and its people both during and after his tenure of office. It is well and sympathetically written, and the section on the recent history of Gibraltar is particularly good.  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 A recent and original effort is our own Pictorial History of Gibraltar, fully illustrated by Sarah Devincenzi, which is an entertaining (and instructive) read for both children and adults.\u00a0   \u00a0   \u00a0Our book!   \u00a0     Normal  0          false  false  false    EN-GB  X-NONE  X-NONE                                       MicrosoftInternetExplorer4",

Foto\u00a0AfpLa capital del pa\u00eds se encontraba bajo un operativo de cierre de emergencia mientras las autoridades de seguridad de Estados Unidos, en un ambiente de tensi\u00f3n, se preparaban para una serie de acciones a favor del presidente Donald Trump en las capitales de los 50 estados del pa\u00eds este fin de semana. Ayer se inform\u00f3 que el viernes un hombre fuertemente armado fue detenido cuando intentaba ingresar a la zona del Capitolio portando un falso pase para asistir a la toma de posesi\u00f3n del presidente electo Joe Biden. La sede del gobierno estadunidense est\u00e1 resguardada con barreras y miles de efectivos de la Guardia Nacional para tratar de evitar ataques violentos como los que sacudieron el recinto el pasado 6 de enero. Trump ser\u00e1 sujeto de un juicio pol\u00edtico por haber azuzado a sus seguidores a irrumpir violentamente en el Capitolio ese d\u00eda, en acciones que degeneraron en enfrentamientos que se saldaron con cinco muertos. El magnate afirm\u00f3 falsamente que \u00e9l gan\u00f3 la elecci\u00f3n y que sus votantes eran objeto de un fraude electoral. La FBI advirti\u00f3 a las agencias de polic\u00eda sobre posibles protestas de grupos armados fuera de los edificios de gobierno de los 50 estados a partir del s\u00e1bado y hasta la toma de posesi\u00f3n del presidente electo Joe Biden, el 20 de enero. Las marchas fueron convocadas por partidarios de Trump, quienes creen en sus falsas denuncias de fraude electoral. Michigan, Virginia, Wisconsin, Pensilvania y Washington se encontraban entre los estados que activaron a sus guardias nacionales para reforzar la seguridad. Texas cerr\u00f3 su edificio del Capitolio hasta el d\u00eda de la toma de posesi\u00f3n de Biden. Steve McCraw, director del Departamento de Seguridad P\u00fablica de Texas, se\u00f1al\u00f3 en un comunicado que la inteligencia indicaba que \u201cextremistas violentos\u201d podr\u00edan aprovechar las protestas planeadas en Austin para perpetrar \u201cactos criminales\u201d. Los preparativos ten\u00edan lugar despu\u00e9s del mortal ataque del 6 de enero sobre el Capitolio de Estados Unidos en Washington por una combinaci\u00f3n de extremistas y partidarios de Trump. Algunos planeaban secuestrar a miembros del Congreso y ped\u00edan la muerte del vicepresidente Mike Pence, en momentos en que organizaba la certificaci\u00f3n de la victoria de Biden en las elecciones de noviembre. Los l\u00edderes dem\u00f3cratas de cuatro comisiones del Congreso estadunidense dijeron el s\u00e1bado que iniciaron una investigaci\u00f3n de los hechos, de la cual informaron a las agencias de inteligencia y seguridad. Su intenci\u00f3n era saber qu\u00e9 se conoc\u00eda de las amenazas, si la informaci\u00f3n fue compartida y si alguna influencia extranjera jug\u00f3 un papel. \u201cEsta historia que sigue en desarrollo es una historia de sorprendente valor de algunos polic\u00edas del Capitolio de Estados Unidos y otros oficiales; de impactante traici\u00f3n de criminales violentos, y de fallas evidentes y de alto nivel, en particular, con respecto a la inteligencia y preparaci\u00f3n\u201d, se\u00f1alaron en la carta. Un hombre fuertemente armado fue arrestado el viernes en Washington cuando intentaba pasar por uno de los numerosos puntos de control cerca del Capitolio, donde Biden ser\u00e1 investido en unos d\u00edas, seg\u00fan un reporte policial. Ten\u00eda en su poder, adem\u00e1s, una falsa acreditaci\u00f3n para asistir a la toma de posesi\u00f3n. Lleg\u00f3 al lugar en una camioneta llena de pegatinas en favor del derecho a portar armas. Wesley Allen Beeler, originario de Virginia, se present\u00f3 la noche del viernes en un punto de control a algunos metros del Capitolio, seg\u00fan detalla un reporte de polic\u00eda consultado el s\u00e1bado por la Afp, confirmando una informaci\u00f3n de CNN. El hombre llevaba una pistola cargada y m\u00e1s de 500 cartuchos. Acciones urgentes Biden firmar\u00e1 una serie de decretos desde el pr\u00f3ximo mi\u00e9rcoles \u2013d\u00eda de su investidura\u2013 para atender asuntos como la pandemia, la crisis econ\u00f3mica, el cambio clim\u00e1tico y la injusticia racial en Estados Unidos, detall\u00f3 el s\u00e1bado uno de sus consejeros. \u201cTodas estas crisis demandan acci\u00f3n urgente\u201d, expuso quien ser\u00e1 su jefe de gabinete, Ron Klain, en un comunicado, a\u00f1adiendo que Biden firmar\u00e1 \u201ccerca de una docena de decretos tras su ceremonia de investidura el mi\u00e9rcoles. \u201cEn sus primeros 10 d\u00edas en el cargo, el presidente electo Biden tomar\u00e1 acciones decisivas para atender estas cuatro crisis, prevenir otros da\u00f1os urgentes e irreversibles y restaurar la posici\u00f3n de Estados Unidos en el mundo\u201d, a\u00f1adi\u00f3 Klain. Al recibir la Casa Blanca de Donald Trump, Biden tambi\u00e9n heredar\u00e1 una serie de desaf\u00edos. Estados Unidos se est\u00e1 acercando r\u00e1pidamente a los 400 mil muertos por Covid-19 y registra m\u00e1s de un mill\u00f3n de casos nuevos por semana. La econom\u00eda tambi\u00e9n est\u00e1 d\u00e9bil, con 10 millones de empleos menos disponibles en comparaci\u00f3n con el comienzo de la pandemia. Y los consumidores y las empresas estadunidenses est\u00e1n luchando por mantenerse a flote. Biden revel\u00f3 esta semana planes para obtener 1.9 billones de d\u00f3lares con el fin de reactivar la econom\u00eda mediante nuevos pagos de est\u00edmulo y otras ayudas, y sostuvo que planea acelerar los esfuerzos para distribuir la vacuna contra el coronavirus en todo el pa\u00eds. Como prometi\u00f3 anteriormente, en el d\u00eda de su investidura Biden firmar\u00e1 decretos que incluyen un plan para que el pa\u00eds se una nuevamente al acuerdo clim\u00e1tico de Par\u00eds y revertir la prohibici\u00f3n de Trump a la entrada de personas de ciertos pa\u00edses de mayor\u00eda musulmana a Estados Unidos, seg\u00fan el comunicado de Klain. \u201cEl presidente electo Biden tomar\u00e1 medidas, no s\u00f3lo para revertir los da\u00f1os m\u00e1s graves de la administraci\u00f3n Trump, sino tambi\u00e9n para comenzar a hacer avanzar a nuestro pa\u00eds\u201d, sostuvo. Biden cubri\u00f3 este s\u00e1bado varias vacantes en lo que ser\u00e1 su Departamento de Estado, con un grupo de diplom\u00e1ticos de carrera y veteranos del gobierno de Barack Obama, indicando con ello su deseo de regresar a una pol\u00edtica exterior m\u00e1s tradicional luego de cuatro a\u00f1os de incertidumbre e imprevisibilidad con el presidente Donald Trump. Biden nombrar\u00e1 a Wendy Sherman como vicesecretaria de Estado y a Victoria Nuland como subsecretaria para Asuntos Pol\u00edticos, la segunda y tercera posiciones en rango en el departamento. Ellas estuvieron entre los 11 funcionarios anunciados para servir bajo el secretario de Estado entrante, Antony Blinken. El equipo \u201crepresenta mi convicci\u00f3n central de que Estados Unidos ser\u00e1 m\u00e1s fuerte cuando trabajemos con nuestros aliados\u201d, dijo Biden en una declaraci\u00f3n. Afirm\u00f3 que conf\u00eda en que \u201cellos usar\u00e1n su experiencia diplom\u00e1tica y sus habilidades para restaurar el liderazgo global y moral del pa\u00eds\u201d. Cinco nombrados son personas no blancas o de la comunidad LGBT. Aunque la mayor\u00eda no son muy conocidos, todos son partidarios del multiculturalismo y muchos est\u00e1n familiarizados con Washington y los c\u00edrculos diplom\u00e1ticos en el exterior. Sus selecciones reflejan las intenciones de Biden de revertir el enfoque transaccional y a menudo unilateral de las relaciones internacionales durante el gobierno de Trump. Por \u00faltimo, Dustin John Higgs fue ejecutado en las primeras horas de ayer y se convirti\u00f3 en el decimotercer y \u00faltimo preso federal en morir bajo el mandato de Trump desde que el Departamento de Justicia reinici\u00f3 esta modalidad de ejecuciones, en julio de 2019. Higgs fue condenado por secuestrar y ordenar los asesinatos de tres mujeres en 1996, aunque mantuvo su inocencia hasta su muerte. \u201cMe gustar\u00eda decir que soy un hombre inocente.

                "text": "For Want of a Nerd the History Was Lost \n\n\n\nHappened This Week, Any Year but This One \n\n\n\n1876 \u2013 The Big Election Goes to Shit. The U.S. presidential election of 1876 took place amid economic turmoil, extreme partisan polarization related to Reconstruction, and concomitant fears of electoral fraud and internecine bloodshed. Its result\u2014or, rather, the lack thereof\u2014was an unprecedented test for our republic. Both the integrity of American political leaders and the resilience of our political institutions were stressed almost to the point of fracture. \n\n\n\nPolling closed on November 5. If measured by the proportion of eligible voters who cast a ballot, the level of expressed interest in the election\u2019s outcome set a record that still stands. Yet, contrary to expectations, the nation was no closer by the following day to determining a victor in the contest, with the campaign proxies of Governors Samuel Tilden, the Democratic candidate, and Rutherford Hayes, his Republican opponent, each claiming a path to victory. Whereas Tilden had plainly clinched the popular vote, his lead among the all-important electors was relatively narrow: 184 to Haye\u2019s 165. That tally left him, moreover, one short of the required simple majority. Meanwhile, four states\u2014Florida, Louisiana, South Carolina, and Oregon\u2014were reporting controversies that precluded their provision of unequivocal results. Hanging in the balance were 20 more electoral votes, enough to put Hayes over the top. As such, neither candidate could afford to step aside. \n\n\n\nIn the ensuing weeks, a horde of party-affiliated lawyers descended on the three Southern states, where they applied pressure to local electoral officials laboring to ascertain the true winner in their districts. The stalemate nevertheless continued through January 1877, when Congress took up the unenviable task of considering conflicting sets of vote totals submitted by the election boards of the three Southern states and their respective endorsing authorities. The ultimate solution came in the form of the \u201c1877 Compromise,\u201d an informal deal brokered by an electoral commission enacted expressly to resolve this intractable crisis. \n\n\n\nBut for the magnanimity and farsighted patriotism of Samuel Randall, the new Democratic Speaker of the House, the 15-member electoral commission might well have met the same fate as all previous procedural means of settling the election. Randall refused to abide another impasse, however, forcing a vote by the commissioners, even after threats of physical injury from members of his own party, with the inauguration only four days away. In the end, the Democrats accepted the upshot of the commission\u2019s vote, an authoritative determination in favor of Hayes, in return for a promise that he would remove federal troops then occupying the South. \n\n\n\nModern Significance. Not applicable. \n\n\n\nDied This Week, Any Year but This One \n\n\n\n1926 \u2013 Annie Oakley. The fabled dead-eye dame of the frontier fantasy industry began life not so much in the American West as in the western edge of Ohio, the state most likely to produce perennially spirit-squelching electoral outcomes. Born in 1860 and christened Phoebe Ann Mosey, the entertainer latterly known as Oakley was one of seven children raised by Quaker parents on a farm along the Indiana border. The pitiless arithmetic of household economics eventually obliged her mother, a two-time widow, to place nine-year-old \u201cAnnie\u201d with a couple that ran an asylum for orphans, the mentally ill, and other abandoned members of the local community. She lived the next four years in a de facto condition of indentured servitude, \u201chiring out\u201d to other families offering meager wages in return for domestic chores. As she later noted in her autobiography, it was a time marked by a dearth of education, a deficit keenly felt and later rectified by Annie herself, and an abundance of cruelty and abuse, which came to an end only when she escaped and headed back to the family farm. Her return coincided with the start of her career as a salaried markswoman. \n\n\n\nAccording to the lady behind the iron sights, her uncanny proficiency with a rifle was entirely innate, rather than achieved through consistent practice, and obvious ever since she began stalking game at the tender age of seven. Her prowess as a hunter proved especially fortuitous to Annie\u2019s mother and new stepfather, who had taken out a mortgage on their homestead during her absence. Taking her father\u2019s old Kentucky rifle in hand, the teenager reportedly zeroed out the principal with well-aimed shots and the resultant proceeds from the wagonloads of meat she sold to nearby businesses. Annie\u2019s introduction to admiring businessmen equally redounded to her growing reputation as wunderkind with a Winchester. Among them was Jack Frost, a hotelier in Cincinnati, who entered Annie in her first marksmanship competition. The 15-year-old\u2019s opponent was Frank Butler, an Irish-born vaudeville performer, whom she soundly defeated despite her youth and relative inexperience. Butler himself ended up as the victor\u2019s prize, with Annie and Frank marrying only a year later and taking their show on the road. Seventeen years her senior, Frank also became Annie\u2019s manager. \n\n\n\nIf not for the promotional acumen of William Cody, the name Annie Oakley might today be nothing more than an obscure footnote in a sensational carnival tradition, let alone synonymous with sharpshooting genius. \u201cBuffalo Bill,\u201d thanks in large part to his skill as a mythmaker, is widely remembered as an Indian fighter, military scout, and all-purpose legend of the American plains. But it was as a variety show impresario that Cody not only developed his factitious persona but also made a more authentic mark on the American scene. With its set-piece reenactments, flamboyant costumes, and grand stunts, Buffalo Bill\u2019s Wild West show brought Hollywood-style Western stories to American audiences a full generation before Hollywood even existed. The show\u2019s celebrity cast was no less of a draw, featuring the heroes and villains of Western dime novels, including Wild Bill Hickok and Sitting Bull. In this way, Cody laid the foundation for the popular image of the American frontier, embellished ever since by legions of authors, artists, and filmmakers. \n\n\n\nAnnie became one of Cody\u2019s contract players in 1885, approximately ten years after she first shouldered her rifle, embarrassed a male competitor, and got some cash (and a husband) out of the deal. \u201cLittle Sure Shot\u201d quickly became one of Cody\u2019s headline attractions, awing viewers with a repertoire that included shooting cigarettes from Frank\u2019s lips, drilling multiple dimes tossed in mid-air, and bisecting a single playing card along its nearly invisible edge. Even Queen Victoria got in on the spectacle when Cody took his show to Wimbledon for the Queen\u2019s Golden Jubilee in 1887. \n\n\n\nAs Annie became world-famous under the aegis of Buffalo Bill, her relationship with her husband changed. Frank, who had formerly received equal billing in exhibitions, began in the late 1880s to play the assistant in her high-caliber act. To the surprise of many contemporaries, both halves of the Butler couple adapted equally well to the adjustment, which turned out to be a more memorable arrangement for audiences at the time. Yet whereas Annie was progressive in her outlook on marital partnership, the self-described \u201cVictorian lady\u201d was decidedly ambivalent about women\u2019s suffrage. Asked about her doubts, the woman renowned for her straight-shooting merely equivocated. Granting the franchise to women, she said, was a good idea if \u201conly the good women\u201d could exercise it. Women in the U.S. military proved less of a conceptual leap for Annie, who offered her services first in the Spanish-American War and then in the First World War. (Both Presidents turned her down.) \n\n\n\nAfter more than 25 years on tour, Annie retired with Frank to Cambridge, Maryland, where they endorsed products and volunteered on behalf of the American war effort in France. Five years of leisure time took its toll, however, and in 1922 Annie began to heed the constant calls for her return to the firing line. These plans were cut short by a car accident, which ruined her health. She died four years later, with Frank, ever the trailing spouse, following her into the grave only three weeks thereafter. \n\n\n\nModern Significance. The combined effect of Annie Oakley\u2019s gender and skill with firearms made her a mystifying cultural curiosity in the eyes of late nineteenth-century Americans. By the end of the Progressive Era, however, a period characterized by eroding prejudices and broad-minded social reforms, her legacy had evolved to befit a distinctive popular hero, reflective of the miraculous talents and wholesome values Americans generously assigned themselves. This Midwesterner has since passed into increasingly irrelevant Far Western folklore, again rendering Annie a curiosity, albeit of the historical variety. Perhaps her only other role at present is to offer a distraction from our anxiety arising from the ongoing election. \n\n\n\nAlthough \u201cMiss Annie Oakley\u201d is scarcely an ant hill on the cultural landscape today, she illustrates a simple rule about who makes an enduring impression on the minds of Americans. Annie, like most cultural icons, lived her life in a way that accorded neither with the expectations of her contemporaries nor with those now prevailing. She was instead singular\u2014in her talent, in her approach to sharing it with the public, and in the views she had occasion to share because of both of the foregoing. That makes her quintessentially American. Indeed, in a country where individualism is a sacred virtue, no character can be more \u201cAmerican\u201d than the iconoclast who challenges our ostensibly settled definitions of American culture and society.",

Some of his best poems are about aging, but what for another poet might be misery, is exalted by a wit that is both epigrammatic and loving. His subject, finally, seems to be perspective itself, what it feels like to be alive.\u201d\u2014 Rodney Jones, author of Village Prodigies (Mariner\u00a0Books) Author: Kimberly Quiogue\u00a0AndrewsContact: washcoll.livewhale.net/live/profiles/12604-kimberly-quiogue-andrewsThe book: A Brief History of\u00a0FruitA Brief History of\u00a0FruitIn A Brief History of Fruit, Kimberly Quiogue Andrews\u2019s full-length debut and winner of the Akron Prize for Poetry, we are shuttled between the United States and the Philippines in the search for a sense of geographical and racial belonging. Driven by a restless need to interrogate the familial, environmental, and political forces that shape the self, these poems are both sensual and cerebral: full of \u201cthe beautiful science,\u201d as she puts it, of \u201cnaming: trees of one thing, then another, then yet another.\u201d \u201cThis superb collection offers up history\u200a\u2014\u200apersonal, familial, postcolonial, geopolitical, ecological\u200a\u2014\u200aand indeed the history of fruit, fruit as sustenance, pleasure, exploitable product, as image, parent, love, and wound. There is no eating fruit without decimating its wholeness, and it is this split, especially in regard to the speaker\u2019s bifurcated racial and cultural identity, that generates the book\u2019s intricate architecture and vitality. These are hard-won poems, fought for, lived through.\u201d\u200a\u2014\u200aDiane Seuss, author of Still Life with Two Dead Peacocks and a\u00a0Girl \u201cAs devotional hymn and origin myth, A Brief History of Fruit braves our \u2018language // of fracture\u2019 to illuminate the blossoms and bruises of family, the sweetbitterness of memory and identity.

A. Villanueva, author of Reliquaria Author: Adam O.\u00a0DavisContact: adamodavis.com/contactThe book: Index of Haunted\u00a0HousesIndex of Haunted\u00a0HousesNamed one of \u201c15 New & Forthcoming Indie Press Gems\u201d by Publishers Weekly and one of \u201cnearly 100 titles that represent some of the best work coming in 2020\u201d by Library Journal, Index of Haunted Houses is a lyric investigation of longing and belonging, of haunting as a mode of living, of history as a congress of ghosts clamoring for attention through a bad telephone connection. Through skillful wordplay and deeply imaginative imagery, Adam O. Davis confronts a country whose fashion, whether in the cities or upon the plains, has always been foreclosure, and, in doing so, explores how we navigate our need for a home as we reconcile with the ghosts that rise from the homes themselves. This is a stunning debut\u200a\u2014\u200aone that will surprise, convince, and, most of all,\u00a0delight. \u201cFrom \u2018the body of New Jersey\u2019 to \u2018the desert/like a house of belief,\u2019 the poems of Index of Haunted Houses traverse the entirety of time and space that we call American. In this book, Adam O. Davis means for language as precise as \u2018ledgers lavish with loss,\u2019 to lead us to the place within us where history meets landscape. This is a brilliant debut.\u201d\u200a\u2014\u200aJericho\u00a0Brown \u201cThe world of this collection is one of debt and desire, ghost stories and foreclosures, where \u2018weather is a borrowed room.\u2019 Yet these poems still offer delight in their alliteration and repetition\u2026.This is a collection of stark witness and testimony, with a voice that manages to sing.\u201d\u2015Publishers Weekly Author: Elizabeth Deanna Morris\u00a0LakesContact: elizabethdeannamorrislakes.comThe book: Ashley Sugarnotch & The\u00a0WolfAshley Sugarnotch & The\u00a0WolfIn the mythic world of Ashley Sugarnotch & the Wolf, two characters are cosmically intertwined, both moored to their past and to the expectations of society. Through syllabic and prose poems, the collection asks questions about what happens when people find themselves in a cycle of violence. Myths, retold over centuries, also mean that these cycles repeat through the storytelling. Both Ashley and the Wolf are modern, but they are forever tied to their\u00a0myth. \u201cElizabeth Deanna Morris Lakes is a thoughtful and careful writer who writes not towards firm conclusion, but instead eagerly towards a consistently blooming imagination.\u201d\u2014 Hanif Abdurraqib, author of A Fortune For Your\u00a0Disaster Author: Thaddeus RutkowskiContact: thaddeusrutkowski.comThe book: Tricks of\u00a0LightTricks of\u00a0LightThe poems in Tricks of Light, a breathtaking collection from award-winning writer Thaddeus Rutkowski, meditate on myriad ways of seeing not merely the small, astounding mysteries of life but how seeing, the effort to see clearly, might be the most important thing of\u00a0all. \u201cFunny, disarming, and profound, Rutkowski will twist a clich\u00e9 into something unique, trick you into a new way of seeing. This is a terrific collection!\u201d\u2014 Denise Duhamel, author of\u00a0Scald Author: Tess\u00a0TaylorContact: tess-taylor.comThe books: Rift Zone and Last\u00a0WestRift ZoneRift Zone, Taylor\u2019s much-anticipated fourth book traces literal and metaphoric fault lines\u200a\u2014\u200arifts between past and present, childhood and adulthood, what is and what was. Circling Taylor\u2019s hometown\u200a\u2014\u200aan ordinary California suburb lying along the Hayward fault\u200a\u2014\u200athese poems unearth strata that include a Spanish land grant, a bloody land grab, gun violence, valley girls, strip malls, redwood trees, and the painful history of Japanese internment. What emerges is a powerful core sample of America at the brink\u200a\u2014\u200aan American elegy equally tuned to maternal and to geologic time. At once sorrowful and furious, tender and fierce, Rift Zone is startlingly observant, relentlessly curious\u200a\u2014\u200aa fearsome tremor of a\u00a0book. \u201cIn Taylor\u2019s stunning new book, Rift Zone, we are faced with the unsteadiness of our current universe, the many \u2018minor scales\u2019 unfurling inside our days, as well as ways of feeling connected through time and trouble.\u201d\u200a\u2014\u200aNaomi Shihab Nye, The New York Times\u00a0Magazine Last WestIn Last West, poet Tess Taylor follows Dorothea Lange\u2019s winding paths across California during the Great Depression and in its immediate aftermath. On these journeys, Lange photographed migrant laborers, Dust Bowl refugees, tent cities and Japanese American internment camps. Taylor\u2019s hybrid text collages lyric and oral histories against Lange\u2019s own journals and notebook fragments, framing the ways social and ecological injustices of the past rhyme eerily with those of the present. The result is a stunning meditation on movement, landscape and\u00a0place. Detail of the book cover of Tricks of\u00a0Light.Thanks for your time!

These celebrated very short stories have been collected over a number of years and have been published in a variety of online e-zines and posted on various websites.  THE ODD AND THE STRANGE by Harvey Havel is a collection of urban tales that toe the line of reality.The subtitle of Harvey Havel\u2019s THE ODD AND THE STRANGE is\u00a0A Collection of Very Short Fiction. A better one would be\u00a0A Very Long Book of Normal-Sized Short Fiction. There are 89 stories in all, most 5-10 pages long (though a few stretch to nearly twenty), with unassuming titles like \u201cVisitation,\u201d \u201cGirlfriend,\u201d and \u201cDaughter.\u201d Though set in the real world, the stories tease reality with nameless characters\u2013the candidate, the doctor, the Big Man\u2013and fantastical occurrences, similar to the parables of Jorge Luis Borges (Argentine short-story writer, essayist, poet and translator, and a key figure in Spanish language literature).Being a librarian, I was eager to read the story \u201cThe Librarian.\u201d A young male librarian\u2013unnamed, naturally\u2013looks into a mirror in his office and sees not his reflection but a woman with \u201cwalnut hair luxuriously long and her skin as supple as a young girl\u2019s.\u201d He has seen her many times, and though the two cannot touch, they can talk. What do they talk about? The books he steals from the library and passes into the mirror for her to read. Eventually, his boss confronts the librarian over the missing books only to be told that the latter he gave them to his mirror-world girlfriend. To prove this claim, the librarian tries to summon the woman, and when she doesn\u2019t appear, the librarian smashes the mirror. You can imagine the rest.Some stories are less Borges and more Stephen Crane (author of\u00a0The Red Badge of Courage): bleak, violent. Like \u201cLightning Love,\u201d narrated by a wife whose husband changes into . . . something (the twist at the end is brilliant). Others are political fables, like \u201cSanta Claus and Madam Secretary,\u201d which makes Havel\u2019s proclivities as clear as the image on a 98-inch TV. His style can be clunky\u2013one woman\u2019s breasts are described as \u201cshaped like a queen\u2019s\u201d\u2013and some endings are telegraphed. A few stories, like \u201cSex Toy,\u201d are more like story fragments. Yet THE ODD AND THE STRANGE is quite an accomplishment: unusual, provocative, and honest.Mixing the fabulism of Jorge Luis Borges with the bleakness of Stephen Crane, the tales contained in Harvey Havel\u2019s THE ODD AND THE STRANGE draw the reader into a world they won\u2019t soon forget.~Anthony Aycock for IndieReader  **Get this book at 50% off at Smashwordsand check out Harvey's other

such a simple, quiet man to a raving lunatic became too much to bear.\u00a0 It started out slowly \u2013 so slowly that one could hardly catch where his personality turned, but it did turn, ever so subtly.\u00a0 I learned how to catch it after a few weeks of observation.He\u2019d come home right at dinner time from his teller job at the bank.\u00a0 We didn\u2019t make much money.\u00a0 He insisted that I shouldn\u2019t get a job myself, but because of our slipping status in the suburban community we live in, I knew that I had to get a job eventually and go against his wishes.\u00a0 We couldn\u2019t rely on my Daddy\u2019s check book forever, and I was perfectly willing to work.\u00a0 He did want me to get pregnant and raise children, but in this day and age, a married couple both had to be working.\u00a0\u00a0After talking with him about this, he didn\u2019t put up too much of a fight.\u00a0 He smiled at me as we held hands on the sofa, and said, \u201cyou can do whatever comes into your sweet little heart.\u201d\u00a0 I kissed him on the lips, and then we made love that night \u2013 not only to make love and to feel the comfort of it, but hopefully to get myself pregnant so that the next stage of our lives could begin.\u00a0 We made love like crazy, and on one special day, after a trip to our fertility doctor, we both discovered that I was pregnant.I had never been so happy, but for some reason, my husband had a somewhat blank expression on his face when the doctor announced the good news.\u00a0 He was neither happy nor sad, just accepting of it, as though a child would bring on another burden, almost like a chore.\u00a0 When I asked him about it, he said, \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s a problem, honey.\u00a0 We\u2019re not the only ones to have ever raised a family, even though we\u2019re heading for broke.\u201d\u201cYou sound uncertain or something,\u201d I said when we arrived home.\u201cI\u2019m not.\u00a0 I just know that this is what civilization is all about.\u00a0 We get married, and then we have children, right?\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s no fixed game plan to life, honey,\u201d I said.\u00a0 \u201cI want you to be overjoyed that we\u2019re bringing a product of our love into the world.\u00a0 We\u2019re blessed.\u201d\u201cI know that.\u201d\u201cThen why does it seem like your brain has stopped working?\u00a0 Why does it seem like you don\u2019t care about what we have right now?\u201d\u201cI dunno,\u201d he said after a moment of two of silence.\u00a0 \u201cI just know that we\u2019re on the right path, I hope.\u201dThat was the best he could do.\u00a0 I let him brood about it more, but he wasn\u2019t even brooding.\u00a0 \u00a0He simply stared into space with a slight smirk, as though he were enjoying thinking about the challenges we may or may not face.\u00a0 I made dinner for him, and we both went up to bed, not really talking at all.\u00a0 I had no idea what went on in that quiet mind of his.\u00a0 We fell asleep at about the same time, and when I woke up, I could smell the eggs and ham he cooked for me.\u00a0 It was nice of him.\u00a0 I supposed he did it, because I was now pregnant.\u00a0 He wanted to start us off on the right foot.\u201cThanks, honey,\u201d I said, kissing him, when I made it to the kitchen.\u00a0 \u201cAt least I don\u2019t have to stop by Dunkin\u2019 Donuts again.\u201d\u201cDunkin\u2019 Donuts?\u00a0 What do you mean?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s where I usually stop on the way to work.\u201d\u201cWork?\u00a0 You can\u2019t work.\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean I can\u2019t work?\u201d\u201cDidn\u2019t we talk about this?\u00a0 We\u2019re raising a family now.\u00a0 You can\u2019t work like you did before.\u201d\u201cHoney, we need the money.\u00a0 Now more than ever.\u00a0 Plus, I want to work.\u00a0 I like working at the store.\u201d\u201cOh,\u201d he said.And then he fell silent while scraping the residue of the scrambled eggs from the pan onto my plate.\u00a0 He looked more confused than anything, as though he were looking for the right response to use, as though he had choices on how to react.\u00a0 He searched for an adequate response while sighing a couple of times.\u00a0 But he agreed with me, and then said nothing, as I walked out the door with my car keys.He returned right after work, and I usually made it home before he did.\u201cHow was your day?\u201d I\u2019d usually ask.\u201cA very slow day,\u201d he said.\u201cThat\u2019s a good thing, right?\u201d\u201cNot really.\u00a0 I\u2019m gunning for a promotion, and I want the bank manager to see how well I do under the pressure of the long lines.\u00a0 We usually have them towards the weekend.\u201d\u201cWow.\u00a0 I didn\u2019t know you were up for promotion.\u201d\u201cWell, now you know,\u201d he said.\u00a0 \u201cWhat\u2019s for dinner?\u201d\u201cI made some meatloaf,\u201d I said.\u201cMeatloaf?\u00a0 The meat must have been expensive.\u00a0 We can\u2019t afford ground beef with the prices they have.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not that bad.\u00a0 And besides, I have to eat for two from now on.\u201d\u201cStill.\u00a0 Maybe you should eat mostly vegetables then.\u201d\u201cVegetables?\u201dI caught him staring into space again.\u00a0 He no longer finished his arguments with me.\u00a0 There was no sense of closure to them.\u00a0 Nevertheless, we both ate quietly, as he disagreed with the meal, thinking it too costly.\u00a0 I could tell, though, that the baby inside of me deserved some meat, and I left it at that.\u00a0 In bed, I tried to move closer to him, but he just refused me.\u00a0 I wanted to make love that night, but he was too difficult to touch.\u00a0 When I moved closer, he said, \u201cyou shouldn\u2019t have bought that meatloaf.\u201d\u201cCan we give it a rest about the meatloaf,\u201d I said.\u201cFine.\u00a0 You take care of the baby, then.\u201dThat remarked pissed me off, but I ignored him from that point on.In the morning, he didn\u2019t make me the usual meal.\u201cWe have to save, so we can\u2019t eat breakfast.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll go to the Dunkin\u2019 Donuts, then.\u00a0 No problem.\u201d\u201cYou should stay there.\u00a0 \u00a0You and the baby.\u201d\u201cNow what the hell is that supposed to mean?\u201d I asked.\u201cYou heard me.\u00a0 Why don\u2019t you both go live there.\u201dI was running late for work.\u00a0 I didn\u2019t want to have an argument there and then.\u00a0 Until he called me \u2018a bitch\u2019 under his breath.\u201cWhat the hell is that supposed to mean?\u201d\u201cThat you\u2019re a bitch,\u201d he declared.I felt like smacking him.\u00a0 How dare he call me such a name.\u00a0 I was, after all, his wife, and I would do anything for him.\u00a0 Somehow, though, he was changing.\u00a0 He wore his bathroom robe in the kitchen, and he hadn\u2019t shaved at all.\u00a0 I could tell that he wouldn\u2019t be going to work that day.\u00a0\u00a0When I got home after a busy day at the store, he sat at the kitchen table with his bathrobe on and his unshaven face.\u00a0 He had been sitting there for most of the day, but he had a kind of beatific expression on his face - this same face of oddity and wonder as though he were still stuck in childhood.\u201cYou never went to the bank?\u201d I asked, throwing my keys onto the kitchen table.\u201cI quit.\u201d\u201cQuit?\u201d\u201cYes,\u201d he said, with that same childlike smirk on his face.\u00a0 \u201cI did it for us.\u201d\u201cUs?\u00a0 Honey, we need that income.\u201d\u201cBut who\u2019s gonna take care of the baby?\u00a0 It\u2019s good that I quit.\u00a0 Someone has to take care of the baby.\u201d\u201cYeah, but we needed the income.\u201d\u201cWhy are you always contradicting me?\u00a0 What a man says in this household goes, you got that?\u00a0 Don\u2019t be such a bitch all the time.\u201dSo out of that childlike fascination with whatever rotated in his mind, came a coarse, disgruntled look, his unshaven face and sharp teeth ready to pounce on me if I said anything else.\u00a0 He watched television, while I ate in silence, and I wasn\u2019t sure what I should do.\u00a0 His personalities changed slowly, but suddenly I felt a little nervous being around him, especially now that he had the habit of calling me names, as though he had snapped away from his earlier innocence into an intense anger that no human being could arrest.\u00a0 And in bed that night, he was a wild, untamed animal.\u00a0 He entered me from every angle, corner, and crevice.\u00a0 Even though a lot of it hurt, he really didn\u2019t care.\u00a0 At the end of it, when he came all over my back, he smacked my behind, and said under his breath, \u201cdumb bitch.\u201dThat was the last straw, really.\u00a0 I needed help, but I had little idea whom I should turn to.\u00a0 I thought a psychologist or couples therapy may help, but I delayed.\u00a0 I needed more time to find someone I trusted.\u00a0\u00a0In the morning, I turned to look next to me, but he wasn\u2019t there.\u00a0 I went downstairs to the kitchen and switched on the light.\u00a0 He sat there at the table in the darkness staring at the napkin holder.\u00a0 He was still unshaven, and he flashed his teeth.\u00a0 He had turned into some kind of beast.\u00a0 He didn\u2019t talk at all.\u00a0 I tried to approach him, but he said, \u201cstay away,\u201d in a seething voice I didn\u2019t recognize.\u00a0 And then I saw it on that rainy early morning.\u00a0 A steel rod leaned against the door.I immediately thought that he would beat me over the head with it, but when he yelled for me to go back upstairs and wait for him like a good whore, I figured quickly that he would use it for something else.\u00a0 He played with some of the mail on the table in front of him.\u201cBills!\u00a0 Bills!\u00a0 Nothing but bills!\u00a0 And then there\u2019s this junk - catalog after catalog of shit we can\u2019t afford.\u00a0 And all of it because of you and that crackpot baby that\u2019s growing inside of you.\u00a0 Well, I have plans for the both of you.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0And then he looked at me angrily.\u00a0 He got up from his seat and picked up the steel rod leaning against the door.\u201cLet me see that baby of yours,\u201d he said, waving the steel pipe around.\u00a0 It accompanied a vicious smile, and then I knew I had to do something.\u00a0 I had to snap him out of it.Surprisingly, though, he didn\u2019t come after me with the rod.\u00a0 He could have killed me, but somewhere deep within me, I knew he wanted our child and loved me unconditionally.\u00a0 I understood that about him.\u00a0 I realized that he could do no harm, and for a second there, I thought I saw him flash the innocent child again - that no-nothing face that seemed to hint that his mind was blank, and perhaps it had always been blank.\u00a0 He banged the steel rod on the floor, but I could tell that his fight was no longer with me, but with himself.\u00a0 \tHe had struggled with himself, and he had struggled so much that it was almost heroic how he kept his own beasts at bay.\u00a0 He then turned towards the door, banged the steel rod upon it, and broke a couple of windows, but I wasn\u2019t scared.\u00a0 I loved this man, and everything about him.\u00a0 He didn\u2019t want to harm me.\u00a0 I knew that now, because in his bathroom slippers and with his demons he ran out of the house into the fields of our backyard.\u00a0 I could do nothing but follow him, because I loved him intensely just then.\u00a0 I rooted for the good within him to win, and he struggled through it like a caged animal.He ran into the open field behind the house.\u00a0 Rain pelted us every step of the way as I followed him further and further outdoors.\u00a0 A clamoring thunder rollicked the sky, interspersed with sharp spikes and veins of brilliant lightning.\u00a0 He readied himself in the rain that had now totally soaked the both of us.\u00a0 He held the steel rod up to the sky.\u00a0 I cried for him to stop, but he didn\u2019t listen.\u00a0 I had to keep my distance.\u00a0 Soon enough, a bolt of lightning struck his steel rod.\u00a0 He glowed for a few moments in the early morning darkness and then fell to the ground.\u00a0 I cried again and ran to him.\u00a0 I sat upon him, straddled him, and noticed a silver, albinic shock of hair that had erupted along the front of his scalp.\u00a0 I smacked him a few times to bring him up to consciousness.\u00a0 The rain, thunder, and lightning still emptied from the sky.\u00a0 We were both wet to our bones.\u201cHoney!\u00a0 Oh my God, honey, please wake up!\u00a0 Please!\u201dI pounded him on the chest, and I smacked him harder and harder as I straddled his body.\u00a0 I couldn\u2019t tell if he were alive or died.\u00a0 I just didn\u2019t know until, finally, he opened those clear blue eyes of his.\u201cHoney?\u201d he called out.\u00a0 \u201cWhat happened?\u00a0 Where\u2019s the baby?\u201d\u201cOh, thank God,\u201d I said, and then I smothered his face in kisses - his eyes, his forehead, his cheeks, and then his soft lips.I now know what to do when he bends out of shape.\u00a0 Making wild and brutal sex won\u2019t help him.\u00a0 Catering to his every whim and need won\u2019t help him either.\u00a0 Now that we have our baby, I have to be extra vigilant.\u00a0 Whenever he gets angrier and angrier about things I know not of, I simply put his steel rod next to the door on soaked, rainy nights.\u00a0 He knows what to do.\u00a0 I put on my raincoat and walk outside with him.\u00a0 He hold the steel rod up to the sky, gets struck by lightning, and then I carry him back to the house.\u00a0 It feels wonderful to\u00a0  Guest Post Topics for Silver Dagger Book Tours Can you, for those who don't know you already, tell something about yourself and how you became an author? I went to a tiny college in Hartford, Connecticut.\u00a0 In my sophomore year, I joined a fraternity.\u00a0 In my senior year, there was a fraternity brother of mine named Jason Morfoot who told me this story about a group of guys who wrote poetry and literature all the time, smoked a lot of pot, dropped a lot of acid, and drove around in a psychedelic-painted bus with the Grateful Dead. Once I heard this story, I asked Jason to tell it to me over and over again, probably to his chagrin.\u00a0 I was so charmed by what the Beats did way back when that I said to myself, \u2018Gee, maybe this writing thing is for me.\u2019\u00a0 Of course, it never turned out the way it turned out for them, but I never would have gone into writing had Jason not told me about the Beat Generation.\u00a0 At the time, it sounded like they lived a fairy-tale life.\u00a0 Perhaps they did. Where were you born/grew up at? I was born in Lahore, Pakistan in 1971.\u00a0 I immigrated to the United States when I was just a newborn.\u00a0 My family first moved to Buffalo, New York, and over the years, we found ourselves in New York City by the mid-1970s.\u00a0 Back then, New York City was in dire straits \u2013 high crime, intense poverty, drugs, etc.\u00a0 I still can\u2019t believe how my mother got through it all, living in the toughest neighborhood in the city at the time, which was then known as Alphabet City, or what is currently known as the Lower East Side.\u00a0 God must have been with her the entire time.\u00a0 I am really amazed at how she persevered. She was incredible woman, even though our relationship was not. What do you do to unwind and relax? I like listening to the radio a lot.\u00a0 Usually, NPR, or Classic Rock and Roll. What inspired you to write this book? Interestingly enough, these stories were somehow stored on my computer for several years before I accidently found them in a hidden file on my hard drive.\u00a0 I discovered nearly ninety short stories that I forgotten I had ever written.\u00a0 It turns out that nearly seven or eight years ago, the poet, John Allen of Albany, New York, had asked me to submit stories for his website, The New Surrealist Institute, which is now defunct.\u00a0 This site had really been thriving, and a core group of authors had submitted avidly to it.\u00a0 It was also quite popular with many readers.\u00a0 When the website went offline, I had simply forgotten about the stories.\u00a0 When I found them, I just knew I had to compile them into a book. I wouldn\u2019t say that anything in particular inspired me to write these stories, though.\u00a0 The ideas came to me out of nowhere, which is why it took a lot of effort to construct them.\u00a0 Some of the political stories were inspired by the 2016 elections, for instance.\u00a0 There\u2019s a science fiction story that is more a personal response to my past relationships with friends who have now grown up to do amazing things with their lives.\u00a0 A couple stories are tributes to old friends of mine who had passed on: a painter friend of mine who had committed suicide in the 1990s and also a Black-American bluegrass musician who had recently passed away a couple of years ago.\u00a0 But I can\u2019t say exactly how I got the ideas for them, which is strange.\u00a0 They are very diverse and, I hope, fun to read.\u00a0 What can we expect from you in the future? Right now, I am working on a book about September 11, 2001, when the Word Trade Center in New York was hit by a terrorist attack.\u00a0 I haven\u2019t been working on the project consistently as of late, though, but I hope to have it done in a couple of years.\u00a0 Sometimes, life gets in the way of writing every day, which is something I made sure to do.\u00a0 But I really do want the September 11th book to be my finest publication, so it is always on my mind, and when I am working on it, I am working really hard. Who designed your book covers? I have to do everything on the cheap, as I have self-published for a long time.\u00a0 I usually find ready-made covers on the web, purchase them, and use them for my book covers.\u00a0 I use a site called www.selfpubbookcovers.com.\u00a0 There\u2019s a guy named Rob there who runs the show, and he has always been very responsive and helpful.\u00a0 He has hundreds of covers to choose from.\u00a0 Hiring designers for the job is just way too expensive for me.\u00a0 Ready-made covers from great designers are a great way to package my books. Anything specific you want to tell your readers? Never give up!\u00a0 Never give up!\u00a0 Never give up! How long have you been writing? I have been a professional writer for nearly 30 years without much success.\u00a0 While I have published 18 books, it seems that it is hard to attract the public to read them.\u00a0 I am definitely not able to make a living off of any of these books.\u00a0 Instead, I have a fixed income every month from a variety of sources, including Social Security Disability, that has sustained me for all of these years.\u00a0 While I am very happy to see all of my peers succeed and do very well in life, it has been equally as difficult to remain within the same income bracket for so long.\u00a0 But then again, if you are concerned about the money, writing is definitely not the right career path to choose, or so is my experience. Lately, I have been taking it easier.\u00a0 I hope to continue writing for the rest of my years, but I do admit that I am a bit tired of always being broke and pinching pennies all the time.\u00a0 That is the hard part.\u00a0 But somehow, I have made it through, and my books are all out there, should anyone find them. What kind of research do you do before you begin writing a book? I invest a lot in the research process.\u00a0 After a general story idea comes to mind, I refine that idea into a plot outline.\u00a0 Once that is done, I target those parts of the plot that I know nothing of.\u00a0\u00a0 For instance, I wrote a book about football.\u00a0 While I had known about football from playing it in my youth, I needed to investigate how professional players practice, not generally, but specifically.\u00a0 So, with that example in mind, I had to go to the library, or surf the internet, to find books that detailed the drills that professional coaches used in their practices.\u00a0 I took this information and then put them on notecards.\u00a0 Then, I added this information to the plot outline and created a chapter-by-chapter outline with the research included in every respective chapter.\u00a0 That\u2019s how it has worked for me thus far. Also, I find it extremely important to include a bibliography at the back of the book, should I use research.\u00a0 That way, the writing is based not only on my imagination, but also cold, hard facts.\u00a0 One should always cite one\u2019s sources anyway.\u00a0 Plus, I have found it really fun doing the research.\u00a0 It\u2019s incredible how much I have learned about a variety of subjects over the years.\u00a0 When writing historical fiction especially, research is always key. What do you think about the current publishing market? Not much.\u00a0 But then again, I haven\u2019t read much of what is out there. Pen or type writer or computer? I usually hand-write a manuscript, revise it on paper, and then I type it into the computer, constantly revising it. I then print out the manuscript and revise it again.\u00a0 But I usually do this chapter-by-chapter, not the entire manuscript at once.\u00a0 I find it easier to break it down into manageable parts. I used to hand-write it and then use a typewriter, but luckily for everyone, the personal computer came along. Advice they would give new authors? Definitely do not put all of your eggs in the one basket of writing.\u00a0 If you are going to write or edit for a job, or work as a journalist for a decent salary, that\u2019s fine.\u00a0 But please do not make the same mistake I had made by banking it all on writing fiction novels at an early age.\u00a0 Even though I have developed as a writer through hardship, I don\u2019t think it was really all that worth it.\u00a0\u00a0 If I had to do it all over again, I would have chosen a career with a good salary, so that I could have afforded a good car, attracted a nice girlfriend, afforded a simple house, and did what most of my peers have done, or at least developed how most people are portrayed in the media of today.\u00a0 I wouldn\u2019t have had such a cavalier \u2018all or none\u2019 attitude about a becoming a writer.\u00a0\u00a0 Betting it all on the one hand and winning at it is the stuff of dreams and fantasy and not reality.\u00a0 I am definitely not saying that it won\u2019t happen, though, because a new author definitely could hit the big time with a book or a number of books.\u00a0 But if you find yourself broke and on the street in the freezing cold, as I have witnessed in every city I have lived in, you should really stop and reassess where you are heading.\u00a0 In my opinion, it is not possible to write under conditions of abject poverty for too long.\u00a0 Better to get a roof over your head before writing that next line.

                "text": "Green is the prime color of the world,  and that from which its loveliness arises.  ~ Pedro Calderon de la Barca (Spanish\u00a0\u2013\u00a0Dramatist\u00a0/ January 17, 1600 \u2013\u00a0May 25, 1681)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHolidays and Celebrations:\n\n\n\nWorld Religion DayBenjamin Franklin DayPopeye Day\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPorte Musings:\n\n\n\nGreen may be the prime colour of the world, but it is also the colour of Florida.  I took the picture for today\u2019s quote in March 2016 in Lettuce Park, Tampa Florida.  Florida has been said to be the state of a thousand shades of green.  Quiet swamps with danger always present in the still waters.  Luckily alligators tend to be sluggish in the winter months and don\u2019t eat until the overnight temperatures reach 60F for about a week.  But I still didn\u2019t take Rickie with me for my walks, just in cast one of the alligators thought he was coming for lunch.  I always took a walking stick to keep between me and the water.  Apparently alligators are very near sighted and at Busch Gardens they said a walking stick is often enough to keep them away. \n\n\n\nBenjamin Franklin Day is set aside to celebrate one of the Founding Fathers of the the USA.  He was a very industrious person, printer, statesman, scientist and inventor. Coming from a family of modest means and being the embodiment of the American Dream:  Anyone can be anything if they work hard enough.  It\u2019s amazing to see the new staff and high ranking positions being selected by President Elect, Joe Biden.  Many of his introductions for the leading roles include determined people that have overcome overwhelming obstacles to achieve greatness supporting and promoting the American Dream. \n\n\n\nThe third Sunday of January is World Religion Day.  So attend a worship of your choice on line.  Don\u2019t forget to support them with your donations during the Pandemic.  Pray for peace and the end of this pandemic. \n\n\n\nToday is also Popeye Day.  So be sure to eat your spinach.  Toot Toot. \n\n\n\nCOVID-19 has had a significant effect on the housing market in Canada.  Prices continue to rise and people are paying over the asking price to secure new homes as the \u201cSTAY AT HOME\u201d orders are still in effect.  My stepson, anxious to have a new home for his new family, sold his 3 apartment live-in residence and hasn\u2019t been able to find a new place prior to the closing date.  So he has put his furniture into storage and will be living with us until they can find a suitable housing replacement.  Being a trucker, he is only home about 2 days every other week, so the task of securing a new residence is even more complicated.   \n\n\n\nOne of the things I hadn\u2019t considered when he asked to live with us was his guns.  I was surprised when he walked in with all of his huge guns (legally licensed in Ontario) and advised me that if the police or RCMP show up at the door I will have to give them access to see that the guns are properly stored.  My father always had a gun for hunting in the house when I was growing up, but that was before gun control.  I quickly asked that my stepson invest in a lock for his bedroom door to ensure the grandkids couldn\u2019t accidently wander in and start playing with them.  Even though the guns are all properly trigger locked, I will feel much better if the room is also locked.  It also ensures that no one will be in his room when he isn\u2019t home.  Hopefully this is a temporary situation, but at the same time, without having to pay for a room he can save more money to put down on his new home.",
