                "text": "Alice Summers   Coronavirus cases in Spain have continued to rocket upwards, as the country registered its highest-ever number of daily cases on Friday: 40,197 infections in a single day. This exceeded a record set only two days earlier, on Wednesday, of 38,869 new cases. Thursday also saw exceptionally high figures, with 35,878 infections recorded in the official government count. Prior to the explosion of cases last week, the highest-ever number of daily infections had been recorded on October 30, with 25,592 new positive tests. As of Friday, a total of 2,252,164 coronavirus infections had been detected in Spain and 53,314 deaths. This is despite a significant drop in the number of tests being conducted. In the week ending January 8, only 804,158 coronavirus tests were carried out, compared to well over a million tests (1,205,303) in the week ending November 5\u2014at the height of infections in the autumn. A funeral at Seville's Cathedral, Spain, Thursday, Jun. 4, 2020 (AP Photo/Miguel Morenatti)Amid this surge in the pandemic doctors and other medical professionals are warning that hospitals are on the brink of collapse as admissions to intensive care units rise rapidly. Within a couple of days, hospital occupancy will exceed the worst figures recorded during the height of the pandemic in November last year, if the current trend continues. Since Christmas, hospitalisations for COVID-19 have increased by around 70 percent and intensive care unit (ICU) occupation rates have gone up by nearly 50 percent. Medical facilities are being forced to ration care and postpone routine activities to cope with the demands placed on them by the surge in coronavirus cases. \u201cMany hospitals are delaying part of their non-covid activity, especially surgery that requires an ICU in the postoperative period,\u201d explained Ricard Ferrer, president of the Spanish Society of Intensive, Critical and Coronary Unit Medical Care. Hospitals in the region of Valencia have been forced to suspend routine operations and non-urgent diagnostic tests in order to respond to the new surge in coronavirus admissions. The regional government has also called for 280 more beds to be made available in field hospitals. In Catalonia and Galicia, hospitals are also warning that they may soon be overwhelmed and are beginning to cancel scheduled operations. \u201cThe forecasts are very bad and the gradient of the epidemiological curve is becoming almost vertical. If we continue this way,\u201d warned Javier Garc\u00eda Fern\u00e1ndez, president of the Spanish Anaesthesiology Society, \u201chospitals will start to collapse within two weeks.\u201d Spanish hospitals now have around 800 more patients in critical condition than a month ago. In many regions, over 40 percent of all patients in ICUs had been admitted for COVID-19: the Balearic Islands (41.04 percent), Catalonia (42.38), La Rioja (45 percent) and Valencia (48.09 percent). There are currently nearly 20,000 patients hospitalised with COVID-19 in Spain, with around 3,000 in intensive care. This is approaching the highest hospital admission figures of the second wave, which peaked at 21,051 hospitalised patients on November 11 and 3,156 intensive care patients on November 16. Madrid\u2019s Society of Intensive Medicine stated that the occupancy of its ICU beds was standing at 90 percent, if taking the number of available beds prior to the onset of the pandemic as a reference point. The Society pleaded for \u201curgent and drastic measures\u201d to control the spread of the contagion and \u201cdampen the rising curve of admissions.\u201d The accumulated incidence rate has also exploded over the last week, having risen by over 200 points in only seven days. As of last Friday, the incidence per 100,000 people stood at 575.1 across Spain, compared to 350.48 only\u00a0a week before. The region of Extremadura continues to be the worst affected, with the incidence rate rising from 803 per 100,000 to a staggering 1,090.30 in a week. Five other regions are reporting rates of over 600 per 100,000: Murcia (739.40), Valencia (727.80), Castilla-La Mancha (725.00), the Balearic Islands (644.60) and Madrid (632.70). Even this is a significant underestimate. Many cases are still going undetected, as indicated by the rising positive test rate across the whole country. Across Spain, around 17 percent of tests are returning a positive result, well above the threshold of 5 percent that the World Health Organisation considers to be a sign that the pandemic is under control. In Castilla-La Mancha and Valencia, a massive 30 percent of tests are coming back positive. This explosion of cases is devastating health care workers, who report intolerable stress and anxiety. According to two studies by the Hospital del Mar Medical Research Institute, nearly half (45 percent) of medical workers are at high risk of suffering a mental health disorder as a result of their work in the first wave of the pandemic. Around 14 percent were suffering from a debilitating mental health condition, with clear negative consequences on their professional and personal lives, and 3.5 percent had had suicidal thoughts\u2014more than double the rate in the population as a whole. The study also showed that nearly one in three health care workers (28.1 percent) were suffering from depression; 22.5 percent from anxiety; around one in four from panic attacks; 22.2 percent from post-traumatic stress and just over 6 percent from substance abuse issues. In the face of this looming catastrophe the Socialist Party (PSOE)-Podemos government is refusing to take any action to bring the contagion under control. Instead, top health officials are blaming the population for the increased spread of the virus, berating them for supposedly having partied or gathered in large groups over the holidays. \u201cEveryone was aware what was recommended at Christmas, [and] I\u2019m sorry to say, perhaps we had a better time than we should have done,\u201d declared Fernando Sim\u00f3n, director of the Centre for the Coordination of Health Alerts and Emergencies. The spread of the pandemic is now \u201cclearly rising and it is a consequence of the behaviour over the last days,\u201d he added. This is a cynical and politically criminal attempt to divert responsibility for the consequences of the bourgeoisie\u2019s \u201csave Christmas\u201d campaign. Regional and national governments outright refused measures to contain the virus in the weeks before Christmas, encouraging workers to go out shopping to ensure businesses got their profits. This was made most explicit by right-wing regional premier of Madrid, Isabel D\u00edaz Ayuso, who declared in the middle of December, as cases were already rapidly rising: \u201cWe\u2019re not planning on bankrupting businesses, closing hospitality or affecting the economy. We will not be the ones to prevent citizens from going in or out of Madrid to visit their families.\u201d The behaviour of representatives of the ruling class such as Ayuso is indeed now having its consequences. Despite the explosion in cases, the PSOE-Podemos government is doubling down on its refusal to act to contain the pandemic. In a press conference on Thursday, Sim\u00f3n declared: \u201cThe option of a [stay-at-home] lockdown, as always, is there. But at the moment it does not seem necessary.\u201d On Saturday, Health Minister Salvador Illa echoed these comments, stating: \u201cWe are not contemplating any stay-at-home lockdown. \u2026 We have the knowledge and the experience; we know how to bend the curve.\u201d The working class cannot place any trust in these corrupt representatives of big business, whose sole concern is to keep profits flowing into the coffers of the financial elite\u2014no matter the cost in human lives. Only an independent political struggle of workers in Spain and internationally will provide the means for an effective struggle against the escalating COVID-19 pandemic and to safeguard lives.",

                "text": "Some fascinating figures here, handy for rebutting the 'But only old people want the Traditional Mass' canard of the liturgical revolutionaries. From Homiletics and Pastoral Review By Dr Joseph Shaw  Young People, Families, Sex Ratios, and Diversity The Foederatio Internationalis Una Voce (FIUV, or Una Voce International) recently submitted to the Holy See a report on the availability of the Extraordinary Form of the Roman Rite around the world (hereafter, \u201cthe FIUV Report\u201d), in the preparation of which I, as Secretary of the FIUV, was closely involved.1\u00a0This included data from 362 dioceses and 52 countries,2\u00a0and gives a rare overview of the situation, not just in Europe and America, but across the world. Much of the information was of a qualitative rather than quantitative nature (for example, detailing the policies of dioceses towards the EF), aspects of it are amenable to statistical summary and presentation. The full report is not public, but in this paper I wish to set out some data drawn from it to help illuminate the question of the demographics of those who attend the EF.3 These data support the often-heard characterization of the EF as having a particular attraction for young people and families. I shall further draw on the Report and other sources to show that EF congregations generally have a more balanced sex ratio than those of the Ordinary Form, and to reveal the capacity of the EF to engage diverse ethnic and linguistic groups. MethodologyThe FIUV was prompted to produce its Report by the news, first reported in April 2020, that the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith had distributed a short questionnaire to bishops around the world on the subject of the Extraordinary Form. The Federation considered that a lay perspective on the situation might be a useful supplement to the bishops\u2019 responses, and set about creating a questionnaire of its own, to be completed, like the bishops\u2019, diocese by diocese. This was circulated, in multiple languages, as an online form, and respondents were invited through the Federation\u2019s member associations and other contacts. In nearly all cases, returns for a diocese were completed by one or more lay persons on the ground in the diocese: people personally familiar with celebrations and congregations, their history, aspirations, and frustrations. One of the questions was as follows: About the stable groups attached to the Extraordinary Form: Are they comprised of elderly people, families, young people, etc.? It should be noted that neither time nor resources allowed for a census of congregations. Respondents were invited to make a judgment about what seemed striking about the congregations they know, bearing in mind the local population (which might be a University city or a popular retirement location); in the background also would be their knowledge of local Ordinary Form congregations. They were asked to tick one of the following, although the software allowed them to tick as many as they liked: Predominantly older people. Predominantly younger people. Predominantly families. Matches local population. Not applicable. Respondents also had the chance to \u201cComment further if you wish.\u201d The data discussed here are drawn not only from the ticked boxes, but also from the comments. In a few cases these explained that different regular EF congregations in different parts of the same diocese had different demographic features. In order to maintain the principle that each diocese would count for one, for statistical purposes, when this happened I have assigned a value of 0.5 to each of two different congregations. In the statistical analysis I created two extra categories, in addition to those just noted, to cover cases where respondents ticked more than one box in relation to a single congregation or group of congregations: \u201cYounger people and Families\u201d and \u201cYoung people and Old people.\u201d Response rateIn a number of countries the Federation received information for every single diocese: countries which have only one (Sweden, Estonia, Denmark and Luxembourg) or two (Malta), and larger countries with very active member associations: Germany (27 dioceses), England and Wales (22), Scotland (8), the Netherlands (7), and New Zealand (6). More typical, however, were those countries where reports were received for only a minority of dioceses, or just one or two dioceses. In most countries surveyed, the dioceses not covered are overwhelmingly those in which, as far as the FIUV\u2019s local contacts are aware, there are no public celebrations of the EF, or active groups of the laity requesting it. Similarly, most of the countries not included, such as many in Africa and the Islamic world, would be returning \u201cnull returns\u201d if they were included. While there are exceptions to this generalization, we may be confident that the FIUV survey captures the great majority of stable groups seeking or experiencing the Extraordinary Form around the world today, and there is no reason to think that these are not characteristic of those which are not included. As it is, the survey extends beyond the places where the EF is regularly celebrated, to include many dioceses where a lay group is asking for it, so far without success. It is this which explains nearly all of the instances in which \u201cNo Information\u201d is recorded. The respondent was either unsure what the demographic profile of those Catholics attached to the EF might be, having never seen them together at a service, or considered that a response would not be very meaningful. The demographic profile of the signatories of a letter to an Ordinary making a formal request for a regular celebration of the EF, for example, might be quite different from the profile of the people who would turn up for the celebration. Who attends the Extraordinary Form?The following table gives the number of dioceses, and the percentage of dioceses, in which the EF congregations are characterized by particular demographic groups, by continent or region.4 (I could not format it, so here it is as a Google Doc.-JW) Table: Dominant demographic in EF Congregations\u00a05 With some variations between continents and regions, the results make clear the very strong association between celebrations of the Extraordinary Form and young people and families. The percentage of dioceses where EF congregations are identified as predominantly old is in no region greater than 11.1%; the percentage where young people, young people and families, or families, is identified as predominant is 72% in North America, 69.2% in Central Europe, 62.3% in South America, 60.4% in Asia, 57.5% in Oceania, 55.5% in North East Europe, 51.7% in North West Europe, 31.7% in Southern Europe, and 28.6% in Africa. In the last of these no information is given for 42.9% of dioceses, and it is certainly no coincidence that Africa and Southern Europe are the areas with the least well-established EF celebrations in the survey. North America, on the other hand, is the region where the greatest number of large and well-established EF congregations are to be found. In many of the regions covered, above all those of Europe, civil society is suffering a demographic crisis, and the Church has experienced this crisis in an amplified form. Thus, while in England and Wales the post-war \u201cbaby boom\u201d has been followed by a decline in the birth rate, the fall in the number of baptisms has been even more severe: according to baptism figures published annually by the\u00a0Catholic Directory,\u00a0compared to annual live births collated by the Office for National Statistics, nearly 16% of babies were baptized in the Catholic Church in 1965, but only 10% of a much-reduced total in 2011.6\u00a0The Church in other European countries has fared worse. Against this background these data for the EF are particularly striking, and positive. Where do they come from?The question arises, where are these young people and families coming from, and how do they relate to each other? It is clear, at least, that the number of families attending the EF around twenty years ago is insufficient to explain the young people present today, in the context of the very small number of EF celebrations in and around the year 2000. The majority of the people, including young people, who attend the EF today have encountered it for the first time as adults. Discovering the EF in the Church today is very much a matter of chance: even in those dioceses where it is most widely available, very little effort is made in sacramental preparation, in officially approved books about the Faith, or in preaching to make the average Catholic aware of its existence. Practicing Catholics are for this reason only slightly more likely to encounter this Form of the Mass than non-Catholics, although they are somewhat more likely to have heard polemics aimed against it. It is therefore unsurprising to find that EF congregations include many converts and \u201creverts\u201d (formerly lapsed Catholics). Another factor in the ability of the EF to draw in younger worshippers is the wide use made of social media in explaining and promoting it, which disproportionately reaches young people. A search of YouTube, for example, quickly throws up numerous well-produced testimonials by young Catholics, often converts, who have discovered the EF. This is an example of a virtuous circle at work, since these videos, like many websites and blogs with similar content, are generally created spontaneously by young people who have discovered the EF and are familiar with social media techniques. It can\u2019t explain why they liked the EF when they encountered it. Similarly, the popularity of the EF with children creates its own atmosphere and set of expectations. In central Rome, where churches are tragically short of children for a variety of reasons, one mother of young children explained to me that an EF celebration she had discovered was the only place she could take her children without their behavior attracting negative comments from an aging congregation: in part, this is an example of another virtuous circle benefiting the EF. \u201cYoung and Old\u201dThis image of the EF, as a form of liturgy particularly attractive to young adults and parents of young children, has only with difficulty established itself in competition with an older characterization of the EF, namely as something which appeals predominantly to the older generation. In the decades immediately following the promulgation of the\u00a0Novus Ordo Missae\u00a0in 1969, it was natural that it would be people who personally remembered the previous liturgical tradition who would seek it out. As time went on, with an extremely small number of public celebrations of the older Mass in the 1970s and 1980s (with exceptions to be noted), few younger Catholics would have any idea that \u201cthe Old Mass\u201d had ever existed. Furthermore, the peculiar Mass times favored by some bishops during the period from 1984 to 2007, when EF celebrations were possible throughout the world but needed episcopal approval, such as early in the morning or during the working day, further took it out of the reach of all but the retired. In that context, it is not surprising that the EF was often dismissed as an exercise in nostalgia, and that there would be a general expectation that demand for it would simply disappear. As Pope Benedict XVI expressed it, \u201cimmediately after the Second Vatican Council it was presumed that requests for the use of the 1962 Missal would be limited to the older generation which had grown up with it.\u201d7\u00a0However, as he adds, \u201cin the meantime it has clearly been demonstrated that young persons too have discovered this liturgical form, felt its attraction and found in it a form of encounter with the Mystery of the Most Holy Eucharist, particularly suited to them.\u201d Those who experienced the Mass before the introduction of the vernacular in 1965 are now of an advanced age: those 15 years old then would be seventy today. They are still to be found in EF congregations, of course, and occasionally the FIUV survey results indicate a congregation dominated by the old, perhaps for demographic or practical reasons. As a correspondent from Scotland laconically noted, of the weekday Low Mass which is the only public celebration in a rural diocese, those who attend are \u201cthose able to.\u201d The older generation can also overlap with the younger: as a correspondent from Chile expressed it, describing the local EF congregation: \u201cone part is older people (mainly women) and another part are young people (mainly men). There are practically no middle-aged people.\u201d It is worth noting that the implementation of the liturgical reform was delayed into the 1980s in parts of the Soviet Bloc, and in the People\u2019s Republic of China celebrations of the older Mass were widespread right into the 1990s. Mainland Chinese Catholics do not have to be very old to remember the EF as a normal part of the life of the Church, and priests are still to be found in active ministry who studied it as a standard part of their seminary training. Some Chinese bishops apparently see provision for the EF today as provision for the older generation, and some celebrants can be critical of the young people who encourage others to attend it. If they expect it to disappear with time, however, they are likely to be disappointed. As just quoted on the Chilean congregation, in many places there exists a middle generation which has missed out on the older liturgical tradition. In Europe and North America, where parochial politics is sometimes a key issue in arranging EF celebrations, it has become a well-worn trope that opposition comes from the \u201cBoomer generation.\u201d More significant is the attitude of the clergy of this generation, who are today the most senior, but still active, clergy in most dioceses, older in fact than many bishops. There are a number of references in the FIUV\u2019s survey results to this generation of clergy. A correspondent from the Baltics notes the \u201cinvisible pressure\u201d exerted on younger priests by senior clergy; one from Scotland notes \u201cideological divisions among the clergy, which tend to fall along generational lines\u201d; one from central Europe regards his Ordinary as \u201cquite supportive but surrounded by canons who are negative and vicious.\u201d An American correspondent worries about the atmosphere in his diocese\u2019s seminary, hearing from priests \u201cconcern that seminarians can suffer for expressing an interest in the EF. It\u2019s difficult to quantify but we get the impression that the hostility comes from the older generation.\u201d The influence of this particular generation of clergy is magnified not only by their seniority, but by the vocations crisis (in the developed world) of the 1970s and later decades. This means that the very oldest generation of active clergy remains numerically very significant in many dioceses. By contrast, one of the remarkable features of the development of the EF since\u00a0Summorum Pontificum\u00a0is the way that it has been taken up by some bishops. In a medium-sized Bishops\u2019 Conference like that of England and Wales, of the 22 Ordinaries we can count eight who have personally celebrated the EF.8\u00a0An earlier generation of bishops were urged by Pope John Paul II to be \u201cgenerous\u201d in response to the \u201crightful aspirations\u201d of Catholics attached to the former liturgy,9\u00a0but the contrast between the episcopal response to those exhortations (a response sometimes reiterated when\u00a0Summorum Pontificum\u00a0was published in 2007), and the view of the average bishop of today, particularly in the West, is startling. Even among those not personally interested in the EF, their attitude can be summarized by the phrase \u201copen mindedness\u201d: if the EF works for some people, and if it can be celebrated without causing practical difficulties, then they are happy for it to go ahead. We read of a bishop in the Philippines: \u201che has not opposed or hindered the EF but he has not encouraged it either.\u201d From the former Soviet Union: \u201cThe Ordinary is not really interested in promoting the EF, but neither in suppressing it.\u201d From the USA: \u201che is open and friendly to the EF. He does not push it, and isn\u2019t confronted with the situation frequently.\u201d The younger bishops today were born in the second half of the 1950s and early 1960s: too young to have taken a personal part in implementing the liturgical reform, and, increasingly, too young even to have felt its excitement, or trauma. It is not surprising if clergy just a few years older have much more emotional investment in the issue. The effect of the final retirement of the older generation of clergy, particularly from influential positions such as seminary rector, could make a substantial difference to diocesan policies towards the EF. Gender Balance10One issue noted in an earlier quotation (from Chile) was the number of young\u00a0men\u00a0who attend the EF. Although the FIUV survey did not ask a specific question on this issue, on a previous occasion I did request and received data from FIUV member associations about it. On the Ordinary Form side, there is abundant evidence from the USA and England and Wales that women outnumber men at celebrations, by about 2 to 1.11\u00a0As I learned from FIUV members, the Extraordinary Form does not conform to this pattern. From around the world I was given figures, for male participation in EF Masses, of between 50% and 75%; the average would seem to be about 55%. The percentages are only part of the story, however. It is clear anecdotally that many men at the Ordinary Form are there at the prompting of spouses or girlfriends, or out of a sense of duty towards children. At the EF it is more common to find that that in discovering it and adopting it as a regular form of worship men were acting spontaneously or taking the lead.12 This is not as surprising at it may seem, since the Eastern Churches, whose liturgy and spirituality have a good deal in common with that of the EF in atmosphere and ethos, also appear able to retain the allegiance of men, as does Islam and Orthodox Judaism. This is true even in the context of their Western converts living in the West.13\u00a0By contrast, there is a longstanding pattern of more progressive Protestant ecclesial communities having a severe imbalance in favor of women.14\u00a0It does not seem extravagant to propose, as a number of writers have done,15\u00a0a fairly simple correlation between liturgical style and an appeal to men, at least as a working hypothesis. Diverse Congregations16As well as preserving a balance between the sexes, the Extraordinary Form also seems to have the ability to attract a wide range of ethnic and linguistic groups. As an Italian contributor to the FIUV Report explained, his local EF celebration \u201cis frequented by people of all ages, several young couples with children, often Oriental (Sri Lankan) or even Africans (Congolese).\u201d A Canadian correspondent noted: Families with young children are very well represented in the congregations of both the churches where the EF is celebrated on Sundays. At one, there are also many young adults and seniors; those attending also come from many national/ethnic backgrounds, e.g., Canadian, American, British, Chinese (China, Hong Kong), Filipino, Indonesian, Vietnamese, Indian, Polish, German, South African, Australian, Korean, Trinidadian, Brazilian, Salvadorian, Mexican, Ivorian (Ivory Coast), etc. An extended explanation is given by a correspondent from Luxembourg. The population of Luxembourg is about 600,000 of which only half hold Luxembour-geois passports, but of these a great many came originally from Portugal, Italy and other places and many have never really integrated. As anyone who lives here will testify, Luxembourg is not a cultural melting pot like London but, rather, a ghettoised society in which each linguistic group sticks to its own. A very significant contributor to this phenomenon is the vernacular Mass. The Luxembourgish Mass, the Italian Mass, the Portuguese Mass, the English language Mass, the French Mass, the Polish Mass and so on are all focuses of attendance by the various expatriate communities. If you attend any of these you are unlikely to meet anyone whose native language is not that of the Mass you are attending. It is at the TLM that you will find a real mixture of ethnic backgrounds. There, you can meet people of Luxembourgeois, Hungarian, British, French, Polish, Japanese, Belgian, Italian, Nigerian, Austrian, Dutch and Spanish nationality, united by the common language of the Church: Latin. The danger of which this last correspondent speaks was noted by the 1994 Instruction of the Congregation for Divine Worship,\u00a0Varietates legitimae, which warned (49) that that the multiplicity of languages in worship might lead to \u201ca Christian community becoming inward-looking, and also the use of inculturation for political ends.\u201d What is true in Luxembourg is true, to an extent, in many cities where migrants are to be found. The Church faces a dilemma: either to put on celebrations of the Mass in a large number of languages, which apart from the practical challenges risks delaying the integration of these communities into the life of the diocese, or to fail to do this, risking large-scale alienation and lapsation. What is a dilemma for well-resourced dioceses in the developed world is simply an impossible situation in many African cities, where migrants even from within the same country can bring with them languages into which the Roman Missal has never been translated.17 The appeal of the EF to migrants is not just a matter of language. When migrants move from the countryside into the city, or from a less developed country into a more developed one, they are frequently (to speak in very broad terms) simultaneously making a transition from a more traditional society to a less traditional one. Those moving to Luxembourg, for example, from Portugal, let alone from Nigeria, may find the spirituality of the Church in their new home strikingly more individualistic and stripped down than what they are used to. It is not surprising that we should find some of them joining the ranks of those born into this culture who yearn for something more rooted, and who find it in the Extraordinary Form. ConclusionThe Extraordinary Form is today attended by a very tiny percentage of Catholics, which is why it is possible to take surveys of Catholics as a whole as a proxy for Catholics who attend the Ordinary Form. After thirteen years of rapid growth following the Apostolic Letter\u00a0Summorum Pontificum,\u00a0it is nevertheless becoming a phenomenon worthy of serious study. Such study is of particular importance to counter lazy or outdated characterizations of the Catholics attached to this Form of the Mass, and it is also needed insofar as the experience of the EF may have something to teach the Church as a whole. I hope that this paper will serve as a contribution to the debate on the place of the EF in the Church, and as a stimulus to further research. I have demonstrated that the association between the EF and young people and families is neither a myth nor something limited to certain countries. Most Catholics have never encountered the EF, but of those who do, mostly by chance, the ones who make it their preferred Form of Mass are disproportionately young, and include a disproportionate number of families with small children. The presence of numerous children at the typical EF celebration can be confirmed, indeed, by anyone willing to set foot in one, provided it is celebrated in a reasonably family-friendly time and place, and is reasonably well-established. The place of migrants, and in general of people of mixed cultural and linguistic backgrounds, at the EF, can be seen, naturally, only in places where the local population includes them. Nevertheless it is very evident in cities such as London, and as indicated in the statements quoted above, can be found in many countries. Easiest of all to confirm is the presence of men at the EF. With Ordinary Form congregations in many places being increasingly dominated by older women, the ability of the EF to retain at least equal numbers of men, as well as young people and those bringing up children, is of no small significance.

                "text": "Even as the rollout of vaccines all over the world brings a glimmer of hope that the current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic may end in the near future, new variants continue to emerge, some with the potential to escape vaccine-induced or therapeutic antibodies. Now, a new preprint research paper published on the bioRxiv* server describes a new American variant that may have become the dominant strain in the USA. \nNew regional variants arise over the course of a pandemic in part due to lockdowns, which restrict the population movement over a period of time. Another factor is the occurrence of multiple mutations at the same time. Epidemiologic surveillance of an infectious outbreak may involve genomic sequencing, which can allow new variants to be identified early in the course of the disease. \nThis method allowed the detection of a new severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) variant, which arose early last year, but has now become very common in the USA. Called 20C-US by the researchers in the current study, it is part of the B.1.2 lineage. \n \nFinding the new variant\nThe first isolation of this variant was towards the end of May 2020. Early on, it showed the presence of five mutations, which led to five changes in amino acid sequence. The affected genes are involved in virion maturation and release, viral protein processing, conservation of the RNA genome, and translation of viral proteins. It later acquired a pair of new mutations. One of these is the Q677H mutation in the spike protein adjacent to the spike cleavage site. \nThe researchers sequenced viral samples from Illinois and traced the emergence of a dominant strain within the 20C clade. The five defining mutations were then identified, namely, N1653D and R2613C in ORF (open reading frame) 1b, G172V in ORF3a, and P67S and P199L in the nucleocapsid (N) gene. The N gene mutation simultaneously introduced a stop codon mutation into ORF14. \nRandom samples were then sequenced from the national pool, showing that this variant made up a large proportion of genomes for most U.S. states, increasing over time, especially since July 2020. In the two months of November and December 2020, this strain makes up half of all sequenced isolates from the U.S.. However, it makes up only a minute proportion of sequences from other countries, including those as near the U.S. as Mexico and as far away as Australia and Poland. \n \nLocation of select 20C-US mutations on the three-dimensional structure of their respective proteins. (A) Structure of nsp14 is shown in orange cartoon and the N138 amino acid in cyan spheres (PDB 5C8S). (B) Structure of nsp16 is shown in green cartoon and the R216 amino acid in purple spheres (PDB 6YZ1). The neighboring glutamate residue and the structured water molecule that it is predicted to hydrogen bond with are shown as green sticks and a red dot sphere, respectively. An S-adenosyl-methionine analog is shown as a space filling model in the nsp16 active site. (C) The structure of nsp5 is shown in yellow cartoon and the L89 amino acid in blue spheres (PDB 7KHP). A nearby phenylalanine available for increased hydrophobic packing is shown as orange sticks. (D) Structure of the trimeric spike protein with one monomer shown as a blue cartoon and the other two shown as gray cartoons (PDB 7JJI). The position of the Q77 amino acid is shown in spheres. Additional important mutations of the spike protein described previously are also shown: the 69-70 amino acid deletion in cyan spheres, the N501 amino acid in red spheres, the E484 amino acid in orange spheres, and the D614 amino acid in magenta spheres.\n\nEmergence of 20C-US\nThe researchers now searched for all genomes from the Global Initiative for Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID) database, which had the five defining mutations of the 20C-US variant. Two additional mutations were needed for this lineage, namely, ORF8:S24L and ORF1a:L3352F. The latter pair were first seen in March and April 2020 from Minnesota and Louisiana. This then gave way to five new sequences containing the first defining 20C-US mutation, namely, ORF3a:G172V, early in April. \nSubsequently, several sequences from late May-early June showed the remaining four defining mutations, which seem to have either occurred simultaneously or in very rapid succession. These genomes were mostly from Texas. Following this, the new isolate appears to grow in prevalence across the country. \nStrangely, however, the earliest isolate containing all five mutations was from Spain, having been obtained from a 90-year-old woman in Spain. This sequence has another mutation at all. It is very rare for mutations to reverse over time and improbable that all four mutations would arise in two different places in the same virus. The only other place where the same combination has been found was Australia, on June 24, 2020. Thus, either the Spanish or the Texan genomes could be the earliest acquisition of the four novel mutations. \n \nCharacterization of recent mutations of the SARS-CoV-2 variant 20C-US. (A-B) Phylogenetic reconstruction and geographic visualization (during the 2-month interval of Nov. 1 to Dec. 31, 2020) of all SARS-CoV-2 variant 20C-US genomes (4683) in the GISAID database (as of Jan. 4, 2021). The ORF1a:M2606I mutant genotype is colored to distinguish it from all other genetic variants within the 20C-US tree. (C-D) Phylogenetic reconstruction and geographic visualization (during the 2-month interval of Nov. 1 to Dec. 31, 2020) for all SARS-CoV-2 variant 20C-US genomes (4683) in the GISAID database (as of Jan. 4, 2021). The S:Q677H mutant genotype is distinguished from all genetic other variants within the 20C-US tree. (E) Plot depicting the rise in percentage of 20C-US, 20C-US possessing ORF1a:M2606I, and 20C-US possessing S:Q677H genomes for all U.S. SARS-CoV-2 genomes in the GISAID database during the indicated months (as of Jan. 4, 2021). (F) Percentage of 20C-US genomes that possess the ORF1a:M2606I mutation or the percentage of ORF1a:M2606I mutants that also possess the S:Q677H mutation versus time.\n\nRecently acquired mutations\n\nRelated Stories\n\nThe researchers then searched GISAID for more recent mutations in this variant, using as a stem the three defining mutations N1653D in ORF1b, G172V in ORF3a, and P67S in the N gene, along with either N:P199L or any mutations at position 2613 in ORF1b. They found over 4,600 sequences, which were phylogenetically arranged to yield a clear branch beginning at two new mutations appearing together. One was 1C4805T, a synonymous nucleotide-level mutation, and a non-synonymous ORF1a: M2606I, which first occurred together in late June 2020, in Wisconsin and Illinois. It is then observed extensively over the eastern and Midwestern USA. About half the U.S. sequences now contain the ORF1a:M2606I mutation. \nIn mid-August, the ORF1a:M2606I branch produced another branch containing the mutation Q677H in the spike gene, which rapidly expanded to 10% of the parent branch\u2019s genomes. While this mutation has often been observed in multiple viral lineages, it has never been part of an expanding or established branch until it was seen in this branch, perhaps because of other compensating mutations or amino acid residues in the rest of the protein. Thus, it is found in only 0.27% of global genomes, but it makes up almost 4.8% of genomes within the 20C-US lineage, indicating an 18-fold increase in prevalence. It is mainly found in the upper Midwest, namely, Minnesota, Wisconsin, and Michigan. \nFurther, close temporal tracking of the ORF1a:M2606I vs. the whole 20C-US genome number shows that the former shows a slowing in growth, perhaps because it has somewhat lower fitness than the latter. However, the S:Q677H mutation may have compensatory effects. While this cannot be authoritatively established at this time due to the paucity of data, further sequencing will help uncover how these two mutations interact and their effect on viral survival. \nImpact of mutations\nThe ORF1b:N1653D and ORF1b:R2613C both affect proteins that are essential for RNA genome and transcript integrity, nsp14 and nsp16, respectively. These could alter the mutation rates and efficiency of translation as well. \nThe parental ORF1a:L3352F mutation in 20C-US is in nsp5 could perhaps improve protein stability, while the relatively new ORF1a:M2606I mutation affects nsp3. This is within the C-terminal domain and is involved in anchoring the viral replication transcription complex (RTC) to the endoplasmic reticulum membrane so that nsp3 can interact with other cytosolic proteins. \nORF3a: G172V is within a protein that is involved in multiple aspects of the viral life cycle at the membrane surface, as well as modulating the host cell\u2019s innate immune response and apoptosis. This mutation is within a domain that transports materials to the cell membrane and modulates interactions with viral or cellular factors. \nThe Q677H mutation in the spike protein, next in position to the furin cleavage site, is thought to increase the infectivity of SARS-CoV-2. This enzyme promotes the cleavage of the spike protein, which is essential for efficient viral entry into cells. The mutated residue is in a similar site to D614G, the globally dominant genome sequence. \nWhat are the implications?\nThe researchers plotted the prevalence of 20C-US genomes in the USA up to December, arriving at the prediction that this would be the most common variant in the country by this point. However, it continues to make up a much larger proportion of the total infections in central and Midwest USA compared to the Northeast and Western seaboard states. \nInterestingly, the increase in this strain\u2019s dominance is synchronous with the start of the second wave of COVID-19. This cannot be explained by a large-scale increase or change in population mobility patterns, whether for shopping, recreation, pharmacy, or transit station use. In fact, workplace visits increased only a little. Without these explanations to account for this variant\u2019s expansion, it seems that this trend will continue. \nFurther study is required to follow up on the fate of the Q677H mutation, which may be involved in viral entry. Tracing this mutation with the M2606I would help understand how this virus is evolving and how its phylogeny affects real-time outcomes of the pandemic. \nOn the available (admittedly scanty) evidence, it is possible that the 20C-US may be more transmissible but less virulent, a fitness advantage that could allow extensive but quiet spread. \nThe 20C-US variant is one of several that have rapidly acquired multiple mutations, such as the U.K. 501Y.V1 and South African 501Y.V2 strains. The researchers say this event may have caused a sudden increase in fitness, allowing it to outcompete circulating strains, just as with the D614G mutation earlier. \n\n\u201cThe ongoing evolution of 20C-US, as well as other dominant region-specific variants emerging around the world, should continue to be monitored with genomic, epidemiologic, and experimental studies to understand viral evolution and predict future outcomes of the pandemic,\u201d said the researchers. \n\n\nThey caution, \u201cUnless successful vaccination efforts can be greatly accelerated, we predict the emergence of dominant novel variants in parts of the world that are relatively isolated from other global regions, possibly including Brazil, New Zealand, the African west coast, and Japan.\u201d \n\nSurveillance will help update vaccine development and predict major potentially dangerous shifts in viral fitness, hopefully in time to take successful countermeasures. \n*Important Notice\nbioRxiv publishes preliminary scientific reports that are not peer-reviewed and, therefore, should not be regarded as conclusive, guide clinical practice/health-related behavior, or treated as established information. \n\nJournal reference:\n\n Source: | Medical News \nThe post New SARS-CoV-2 variant emerges in the U.S. appeared first on Sound Health and Lasting Wealth. \n\nNo related posts.",

They all have different languages descended from a similar group, Irish\u00a0(Gaeilge),\u00a0Scottish\u00a0(G\u00e0idhlig),\u00a0Manx\u00a0(Gaelg),\u00a0Welsh\u00a0(Cymraeg),\u00a0Cornish\u00a0(Kernowek), and\u00a0Breton\u00a0(Brezhoneg). Some are more widely spoken than others, for example Welsh is still commonly spoken in Wales, whereas hearing Cornish in Cornwall instead of English is rare.\u00a0  All Celtic nations have\u00a0varied\u00a0mythology and culture.  Irish Mythology is different from Breton Mythology, and even Welsh and Cornish mythology (arguably the most related Celtic Nations) have subtle differences to each other. I wish I could add more about the cultures at this time\u00a0but my knowledge of Celtic nations is primarily made up of the history and languages of those regions, particularly Cornwall.\u00a0 \nYou might have notice that England and English are missing from this, because the English descended from\u00a0Anglo-Saxons, who were German invaders that came to the isles right around the Fall of the Roman empire in the 5th Century, erasing the Celtic influence in what is now England.\u00a0 \nSo what this all really means is that Celtic is an\u00a0umbrella\u00a0term, and just because it\u2019s Celtic doesn\u2019t mean it has anything to do with Ireland at all. So don\u2019t assume that just because someone\u2019s talking about something Celtic that they\u2019re talking about something Irish. \n\nI actually didn\u2019t know this. Thank you, tumblr person \n\nI love you for this. I love learning and this day started in a good note. \n\nFurthermore there are currently six modern Celtic languages divided into two families. The Goidelic or Gaelic languages: Irish, Scots Gaelic and Manx, which are all descended from Middle Irish; and the Brythonic languages: Welsh, Cornish and Breton all descended from Common Brythonic. It should be noted that both Manx and Cornish are revived languages, that is they effectively died (There were no living native speakers) for a time, but revitalisation efforts amongst the communities to learn the languages as second languages resulted in children picking up the languages as their first language, thus returning the languages to living languages with communities of native speakers. Although all of the languages are growing in number of speakers at each count, only Welsh is not counted as being endangered. This revitalisation is part of why the written form of Manx is so different to that of its sisters, despite the close similarity of the spoken form; its spelling is designed to make sense to a native English speaker, whereas Irish and Gaelic use a more traditional phonetic spelling system which only makes sense if you are used to the concept of a s\u00e9imhi\u00fa being represented by the letter h. The Manx for \u201cIsle of Man\u201d, for example, is\u00a0\u201cEllan Vannin\u201d whereas the Irish name is\u00a0\u201cOile\u00e1n Mhanann\u201d while the spelling is very different the actual pronunciation is almost identical. Both refer to Manann\u00e1n mac Lir of the Tuath d\u00e9 Danann, an ancient race of supernatural creatures, often interpreted as a christian retelling of the ancient Gaelic gods. \n\nAlso, depending on who you ask, there\u2019s a seventh Celtic nation! It\u2019s Galicia, a region in northwestern Spain. Opinions are divided as to whether it\u2019s Celtic enough to\u00a0\u201ccount\u201d, but here are some sources for further reading: \nBBC: Where is the seventh Celtic nation? Spain Then and Now: The Celts in Spain Journal of Interdisciplinary Celtic Studies: Celtic Legacy in Galicia University of Pennsylvania Museum: The Modern Celts of Northern Spain \n\u2026and I can\u2019t help but link to my own post of the beautiful song\u00a0\u201cVa unan,\u201d sung in Breton and Spanish by the chorus \u201cL\u2019Ensemble choral du bout du monde\u201d with the Spanish guest vocalist Jes\u00fas Cifuentes from the band Celtas Cortos. \n\nI think I\u2019m honor bound to always repost this.",

                "text": "Trump publicly declared his love for the insurrectionists he gathered, although saying on other occasions he knows nothing specifically about the Proud Boys, Boogaloo, and QAnon, of whom his crowd was partly composed. But he and his followers keep flashing the \u201cOK\u201d hand sign which the Proud Boys associate with White Power. The American Civil Liberties Union traced this usage to February 2017, when \u201c4chan\u201d launched \u201cOperation O-KKK\u201d to claim this meaning. So is it a deliberate racist dog whistle, or is the president a Know-Nothing about racial undertones? \nWhatever its modern intent, the signal may be more deeply imbedded in our history, dating back to the 1850s as part of the Golden Circle Conspiracy. Their most notorious western chapter was connected to Santa Cruz. \nJohn C. Calhoun felt a ruling majority could be detrimental to a special interest group, and felt decisions impacting that group should be made with it\u2019s approval. Listening to minority stakeholders has become an important part of democracy, although Calhoun\u2019s \u201cminority\u201d was Slaveholders, who ruled without the approval of the enslaved. Fearing Free States would outnumber Slave States, some sought the conquest of border regions for new Slave States. \nThe Order of the Lone Star was formed in 1834 to promote Texas Independence from Mexico, becoming a Slave State in 1836. Calhoun and the Order of the Lone Star inspired the founding of \u201cSouthern Rights Clubs\u201d beginning around 1835, who made a fetish out of minority rule over the majority. These clubs were dedicated to reviving the African Slave Trade (banned in 1808), as a resource for expanding slavery to other states. \nThe Circle\nOn July 4, 1854, George Bickley founded the \u201cKnights of the Golden Circle\u201d in Lexington, Kentucky, to promote the goal of a Slave Empire composed of Mexico, Central America, and the Caribbean, headquartered in Havana, Cuba. This was partly realized by William Walker, who raised an army in San Francisco, to invade Baja and the gold-fields of Sonora for a Slave Republic, but Mexico forced him back to California, where he was tried-and-acquitted for violating the U.S. Neutrality Act. Undaunted, in 1855 Walker invaded Nicaragua, conquered it, and in 1856 repealed its law forbidding slavery. He was driven out in 1857, returned to Honduras in 1860, only to be executed by a Honduran firing squad. Meanwhile, Brownsville, Texas, was the center of two border wars with Mexico. \nTom Poole of Pajaro, a Knight of the Golden Circle.\u00a0(Contributed)\n(President Benito Juarez, brought Democracy to Mexico, while fighting Civil War and invasion.\u00a0Contributed)\nGolden Circle members in President James Buchanan\u2019s administration included the Secretary of War John Floyd, Secretary of the Treasury Howell Cobb, and Vice President John Breckenridge. In a conspiracy to \u201cseize Navy-yards, Fords, etc.,\u201d Floyd moved munitions and men into the South to aid Confederate intentions, until the plot was exposed, creating a backlash against secret societies and Slavery advocates. \nThe passage of Mexico\u2019s 1857 Constitution created a radical restructuring of Mexican law, horrifying the Conservative Party who wanted a traditional Colonial Aristocracy, where wealth, church, and military oversaw a peonage of bonded servitude, under a Police State. The 1857 Mexican Constitution introduced freedom of speech, conscience, press, assembly, and the right to bear arms. It abolished slavery, peonage (debt slavery), debtors prison, torture, and reserved the death penalty for extreme crimes only. It promoted separation of church and state, public education without dogma, banning monopoly and elite privileges. \nThe Conservative Party forced the Liberal president out of power, which gave succession to Supreme Court head Benito Juarez of the Liberal Party, the first Mexican president of indigenous origins. Conservatives launched a three-year Reform War, at last surrendering in December 1860. This Mexican Civil War was costly, leaving a large foreign debt. Preparing for an American Civil War, Texas didn\u2019t take advantage of Mexico\u2019s weakness. In 1861, Juarez had to suspend payments to Spain, France and Britain. So these three countries occupied Mexico in the winter of 1861 as a pressure tactic. The Spanish and British withdrew in 1862, but the Conservatives conspired with the French to do-away with democracy, and install an Emperor.\u00a0 France went to war with Mexico. \nWhile California assemblyman Andres Pico had joined slave interests in 1859 attempting to carve a new state out of the middle of California, the invasion of Mexico had him side with his Lincoln-backing relative Antonio Maria Pico. Antonio, son of a Santa Cruz mission soldier, and grantee of Pescadero (then in Santa Cruz County), resigned his land-office job in 1862, to establish with his own money U.S. Army Calvary units of Spanish Californios. On March 3, 1863, his nephew Jose Ramon Pico (commander of Company A) recruited them at San Jose Plaza, saying \u201cSons of California! Our country calls, and we must obey! This rebellion of Southern states must be crushed\u2026! Crown monarchs must be driven away from the sacred continent of Free America!\u201d French intervention in Mexico violated the Monroe Doctrine. But the American response could not be triggered due to the Confederate threat. \nConspiracy\nKentucky-born Thomas Bell Poole came to Watsonville in 1856, and established a farm in Pajaro just south of the river. He became Monterey County undersheriff in 1858, hanging a convict against the governor\u2019s orders.\u00a0 When charged with murder, Poole defended himself on the technicality the convict\u2019s name was misspelled on the order. Returned to his farm, Poole\u2019s wife died in 1860, so he took his three kids to San Francisco just as the war began, and became a member of the Golden Circle, which now supported the Confederate cause as spies and fund-seekers. The group was said to have 16,000 members, and recognized each other by the circle hand gesture. \nCalifornia was in a precarious state at the start of the war. It shipped east $4-million in gold and silver a month, without which the Union cause would collapse. Yet at that moment, all California military posts were commanded by Southern-born officers. California was cut-off from gunpowder shipments, now prioritized for eastern battlefields. The first Golden Circle plan was to seize San Francisco forts, armory, mint, custom house, and shipyards, and assist plans proposed by ex-governor John Weller and Senator Wm. Gwin, to turn California into a Pacific Confederacy. However, the plan was thwarted. Needing a loyal district to manufacture all the west\u2019s gunpowder, the state chose the canyon area north of Santa Cruz, incorporating the California Powder Works on Dec. 28, 1861. (Yet production didn\u2019t begin until May 1864). \nAn 1863 account purporting the history of the Knights of the Golden Circle. They changed their name several times to make it seem they were defunct, but continued to operate with the same exact members and customs.\u00a0(Contributed)\nMeanwhile, it was learned there were mines on Catalina Island that were starting to yield gold, silver and led.\u00a0 The Golden Circle wanted a colony on the island for mining and piracy of the shipping lanes. As a result, the Circle purchased the J.M. Chapman in 1863 as their first pirate ship, outfitted in San Francisco Bay, with Poole in the crew. Former Pacific Mail line\u2019s captain W.C. Law was chosen as pilot, to track and seize ships, sending gold and silver to the Confederacy, and converting captured ships into a Pirate Navy. \nOn March 17, the night of their departure, a navy ship spotted them loading things not on their manifest, and sent revenue agents, police, and naval officers to investigate. They found shipments of arms and canons, with 15-to-17 undeclared men hiding in the hold with cocked pistols and Bowie knives. Even their pirate\u2019s oath of secrecy was discovered! They were thrown into Fort Alcatraz, indicted for treason in October, and sentenced to 10 years and $10,000. The Army then wrote to Camp Drum in Los Angeles on Nov. 21, 1863, alerting them of the \u201ccommercial importance\u201d of Catalina island. A U.S. military post was built at the Catalina Isthmus (still standing today), to run the mine, and defend the coast, yet telling the public it was to create an Indian reservation. \nMisadventures\nMost of the pirate crew stayed only nine months at Alcatraz, before they were allowed to swear an oath of loyalty to the Union and be released, as part of Lincoln\u2019s amnesty of Dec. 8, 1863. Yet Poole\u2019s word was good for nothing, as he went to a hideout at the foot of Loma Prieta, where Southerners complained there were no experienced Confederate leaders in California. Then in 1864 Rufus Henry Ingram arrived, a notorious member of Quantrill\u2019s Raiders during the Lawrence Massacre of 150 men and young boys on Aug. 21, 1863.\u00a0 It horrified Kansas abolitionists, and delighted Confederates. Excited by the massacre, a plan was hatched to do a similar raid in San Jose, robbing and burning banks and stores. \nHowever, when the local sheriff discovered the plan, they abandoned it for robbing two Placer County stagecoaches of gold and silver. When a Placerville posse caught up with them in Santa Clara County, one deputy was killed and Poole wounded, then captured. On Aug. 27, 1864, Poole was found guilty in 15 minutes, and sentenced to hang. A request for clemency signed by the sheriffs of Monterey, Santa Cruz, and El Dorado counties, was turned down by the governor. The former undersheriff now saw things from the other end of the rope. \nOn April 10, 1864, France installed Maximilian I as Emperor of Mexico. Robert E. Lee surrendered April 9, 1865, and President Abraham Lincoln was assassinated six days later. Now-President Andrew Johnson invoked the Monroe Doctrine, recognizing Benito Juarez in exile as the legitimate president of Mexico, and imposed a naval blockade on Mexico in 1866. Maximilian then welcomed ex-Confederates to move to Mexico in a dozen Confederate colonies, while executing 11,000 of Juarez\u2019 supporters. Having lost even his Conservative backer, France withdrew support, and urged Maximilian to flee Mexico. Instead, he went to war, was captured, and executed. \nAfter the war, Golden Circle members such as Jesse James and his gang, continued their legacy of robberies, this time against Yankee-owned banks. The Golden Circle went through several name changes, at last settling on the Greek word for Circle: Kuklos, becoming \u201cKnights of the Ku Klux Klan.\u201d This violent movement only lasted five years, until the Klan was outlawed under the Enforcement Act of 1870. \nRoss Eric Gibson is a former history columnist for the San Jose Mercury News and Santa Cruz Sentinel.",

                "title": "The unwritten history of Orientalism",
                "text": "Edward Said wrote: \"The Orient that appears in Orientalism, then, is a system of representations framed by a whole set of forces that brought the Orient into Western learning, Western consciousness, and later, Western empire. If this definition of Orientalism seems more political than not, that is simply because I think Orientalism was itself a product of certain political forces and activities. Orientalism is a school of interpretation whose material happens to be the Orient, its civilizations, peoples, and localities.\"[1][my stress]  \" \u2026 later, Western empire\". How about earlier?  Although Said institutionalized in Arab discourse a timeless model in which Europe had always been the oppressor, he nonetheless admits that it was not always so.  Islam was founded 1397 years ago, in 623 AD. Less than one century later -- after conquering the Christian lands of Egypt, Palestine, Syria, Iraq and North Africa -- it started colonizing Europe when it invaded Spain from North Africa in 718. The Arabs were eventually expelled from Spain after 8 centuries, in 1492, but by then other Muslims, namely Turks, had established colonies in southeastern Europe, in what is now Greece and Bulgaria. Eventually the Turks -- known officially as the Ottoman Empire -- seized all of the Balkans, comprising Greece, Bulgaria, Romania, Serbia, Croatia, Bosnia, Albania, and so forth, plus Hungary and large chunks of the Ukraine and southern Poland. The Turkish colonies in southeastern Europe were not liquidated until 1912 as a result of the Balkan wars. So for 1194 years -- from 718 to 1912 -- Europe was colonized by Islam. For almost 12 centuries there were Muslim colonies in Europe. For 85% of the time between Mohammed's death (632 AD) and the present, Muslim empires possessed European colonies, usually very large ones.  Geneva, in Switzerland, was conquered by a North African army in 939 AD. The Moors held Geneva and western Switzerland for several decades, launching raids northward and eastward, until their beachhead on the Mediterranean Sea was captured by an army under the Duke of Lombardy, their supply line was cut off and they were forced to retreat.[2] There were several European occupations of territories in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) during that period, for instance the Crusader states and various Spanish and Portuguese occupations of North African ports like Tunis, Oran, Tangier, and so forth. Only two of them survive today, namely the Spanish ports of Ceuta and Melilla on the North African coast, with a combined surface of less than 20 sq mi. For its part Turkey still occupies the European territory of eastern Thrace, including Istanbul, comprising a surface area of about 10 thousand square miles, slightly smaller than Israel.  The first extensive European possession in MENA was Algeria, which the French conquered beginning in 1830, in part to eradicate Moorish piracy (generally known as \"Barbary corsairs\", which had plagued the western Mediterranean Sea for a millennium. [3]The last extensive European possession in MENA was South Yemen, which the British vacated in 1967.  1967 minus 1830 = 137 years.  Consequently European colonialism in MENA lasted 137 years, whereas Muslim colonialism in Europe lasted 1194 years, almost nine times as long.  Despite 12 centuries of Muslim colonialism in Europe, when post-colonials talk about colonialism, they mean exclusively European Christian colonialism outside of Europe, which in the Middle East and North Africa lasted little more than one century, and they rigorously exclude Muslim colonialism in Europe, which lasted nearly nine times as long!  Furthermore they leave out European Muslim colonialism, such as for example the domination of North African countries by white European Muslims under the Ottoman Empire, when Albanians, Turks and Circassians dominated Egypt, Algeria and other regions.  All these discrepancies and awkward gaps in the decolonial discourse show what a load of codswallop decolonial theory is.  Zachary Lockman writes of the beginnings of Orientalism in England:  \u201cPolitical and commercial considerations also sometimes helped stimulate the development of Orientalism as a scholarly field in this period. For example, the creation of chairs of Arabic at the universities of Oxford and Cambridge in the mid-seventeenth century was supported by English officials and merchants anxious to expand English trade in the Mediterranean; there was also widespread concern about the many Britons who had been captured and held for ransom by Muslim raiders (the \u201cBarbary pirates\u201d) based along the North African coast.\u201d[4] Gilles Kepel, the preeminent French specialist on Islam, described thus his visit to the Kabylia region of Algeria in 2014:  \u201cWe arrive in sight of the village:\u00a0 incessant warfare among\u00a0 clans and tribes in the Kabyle mountains have to this very day perched all human dwellings on hilltops. Just like formerly in the hinterland of Nice [southern France] where the fear of Saracen [i.e. Muslim] incursions crowded the inhabitants\u2019 houses on steep fortified peaks far from the seashore.\u201d[5] In 1627 Barbary slavers sailed as far north as Iceland to seize slaves.  \"Pirates from Morocco and Algeria, under the command of Dutch pirate Murat Reis, raided the village of Grindav\u00edk on the southwestern coast, Berufj\u00f6r\u00f0ur and Brei\u00f0dalur in the Eastern Region (the East Fjords), and Vestmannaeyjar (islands off the south coast); they captured an estimated 400\u2013800 prisoners to sell into slavery.\" [6]  Suleiman the Magnificent (r. 1520-66) Lockman cites another instance in which Europeans studied Oriental matters from a standpoint of weakness:  \"But some Europeans ... sought to grasp the secret of the [Ottoman] empire\u2019s success, often contrasting Ottoman virtues with the defects of their own societies.\"[7] Therefore Said's definition of Orientalism as a \u201cWestern style for dominating, restructuring, and having authority over the Orient\u201d applies -- if at all -- only to a specific historical epoch. It is nothing but a fraud to pretend that it has universal validity, or that it is valid now, when Europe's power over Asia and Africa is but a small fraction of what it was a century ago, which is the model on which Said's book is based.  Moreover, the spiritual leader of the Muslim Brotherhood, Yusuf al- Qaradawi, in 2003 issued a fatwa that envisaged renewed Muslim domination of Europe. Referring to the expulsion of the Muslim rulers from Spain in 1492 and from most of the Balkan Peninsula in 1912, he wrote: \"After having been expelled twice, Islam will be victorious and reconquer Europe [...] I am certain that this time, victory will be won not by the sword but by preaching and [Islamic] ideology.\"[8] \u00a0 \u00a0                                                             [1] Orientalism, by Edward Said, p 224    [2]Kees Versteegh: The Arab Presence in France and Switzerland in the 10th Century.

                "text": "I'd heard of\u00a0Integralismo Lusitano, but until I read this, I knew virtually nothing about it. Fascinating! Now, I want to know more. From The European Conservative By\u00a0Manuel Rezende It was the spring of 1913, and the republican political elites in Portugal were getting restless. They had established their own dominion over Portuguese politics, ousted the last king three years earlier, and ruled over the country with a tight grip. The Democratic Republican Party had been an almost invisible party during the 1890s. The Portuguese constitutional monarchy managed to keep the influence of the republicans concentrated around the educated classes and in certain urban areas, mainly in Oporto and Lisbon, the main cities of the Realm. The increasing predominance of French politics in the country, the dictatorship of Prime Minister Jo\u00e3o Franco, backed by King Carlos I, and the subsequent serious decline in the popularity of the monarchist regime created the perfect storm for a Republican Revolution in 1910. The regicide of 1908, which took the lives of both the king and his heir, leaving the throne to an unprepared Manuel II, was the final touch. To be perfectly clear, there had already been a republican revolution in the city of Oporto in 1891. However, these republican partisans were very different; they were nationalist republicans who were weary of British influence in Portuguese international affairs and Portugal\u2019s economy, as well as the powerful and castrating influence of French political thought and philosophy on Portuguese cultural and intellectual production. Unfortunately, this first coup was unsuccessful. It would be a totally different one that would emerge victorious in Lisbon on October 5, 1910. These republicans were positivists of the French school: radical progressives bent on the destruction of religion and the Portuguese social order and committed to the establishment of a Jacobin-like republic that would change the cultural landscape of the country forever. What followed was not entirely unprecedented: priests and nuns were persecuted, while political opponents were taken away by authorities to have their craniums measured. (This was part of an attempt to establish phrenology as a valid method to explain the inferiority of the religious mind compared to that of the so-called rationalists.) At the time, in 1910, republican Jacobinism was a passing fashion in Europe, so Portugal was a political oddity. Thus, the main republican\u00a0caciques\u00a0became quite alarmed when they saw the Portuguese youth getting up with the times, especially, once again, with what was really going on in France. For powerful men like Afonso Costa, Aquilino Ribeiro, Bernardino Machado, and others, the news from Paris was disturbing. The old city of the revolutionaries had died, giving way to a new kind of political opponent: one that was far more terrible than the old liberal and conservative parties of the diseased constitutional monarchy.  It was called\u00a0Action Fran\u00e7aise,\u00a0and its leader was Charles Maurras. Unlike the French Legitimists, the Spanish Carlists, and the Portuguese Miguelists, these were not \u2018normal\u2019 traditionalists. They actually had an agenda other than mere ultramontanist Catholicism and an unbridled defense of the Throne. In fact,\u00a0Action Fran\u00e7aise\u00a0had close ties to the political thought of anarchists like Proudhon and was joined by great names of the Left, such as Georges Sorel. By 1917, these new monarchists could boast of their own magazine,\u00a0Na\u00e7\u00e3o Portuguesa\u00a0as well as the cooperation of unions, liberal workers, farmers, and segments of the army. As a movement, they called themselves\u00a0Integralismo Lusitano\u00a0and their leader was Ant\u00f3nio Sardinha. The birth of the Pelican Much like what had happened in France,\u00a0Integralismo Lusitano\u00a0received the support of thinkers and patriots who had quickly become disillusioned with the Portuguese First Republic. Why should they not? In the 16 years of the First Republic, from 1910 to 1926, Portugal had witnessed 45 governments, an endless series of coup d\u2019\u00e9tats, the dominion of far-left terrorist groups on the streets of Lisbon, and an average frequency of bombs exploding in the streets and apartments of the capital that surpassed that of the first two years of the American occupation of Baghdad. Portugal earned a negative reputation in European circles during those days, and the disastrous participation of Portuguese contingents during the First World War did little to help. Sardinha was himself an ex-republican. However, he would always look back to those early days as a revolutionary youth and, even combined his newfound Catholic faith, to the values he had been taught by the republican nationalists who had been vanquished in 1891.\u00a0Integralismo Lusitano\u00a0took much from\u00a0Action Fran\u00e7aise, but Sardinha made sure he would give it its\u00a0own\u00a0identity. The Portuguese integralists based their worldview in history and theory, claiming both the legacy of the Thomists as well as the novelties of Comte\u2019s positivism. They looked for inspiration in the medieval guild system and in the doctrines of Georges Sorel around the theory of myth. This unique blend of Tradition and Modernity sought to validate Portugal both as an independent organism and as a collective soul. That, in particular, was a consequence of Maurras\u2019s great influence. Maurras and\u00a0Action Fran\u00e7aise\u00a0were fighting the individualism that had been gnawing away at the roots of Europe ever since the French Revolution. Their great discovery \u2014 bolstered by\u00a0the work of Numa Denis Fustel de Coulanges\u00a0and the French Sociologists \u2014 was that communities had a life of their own, a collective destiny. To mark their movement as something unique and distinct from their French counterparts, the Portuguese integralists adopted as their symbol the Pelican, a Christian symbol relating to the sacrifice of Jesus Christ. A pelican was also used as the personal seal of Portugal\u2019s King Jo\u00e3o II (1455-1495), a great reformer who contributed to some of the greatest achievements of the Portuguese \u2018Age of Discovery\u2019 (such as the finding of a sea route to India). This 82 x 72 cm ceramic medallion, created in the workshop of Andrea Della Robbia in the 16th century, celebrates the memory of King Jo\u00e3o II of Portugal. It is composed of three elements, according to the Museu Nacional de Arte Antiga in Lisbon: \u201cthe pelican feeding its young with its blood \u2014 which is a Christological, Eucharistic, and political symbol associated with the motto \u2018For the Law and for the People\u2019 \u2014 forms the body of the emblem; the phrase \u2018IVSTVS VT PALMA FLOREBIT ET\u2019 (the righteous shall flourish like the palm tree), which is taken from the Book of Psalms (92:13), is the soul of the emblem; the top of the palm tree \u2014 which serves as the nest for the baby pelicans \u2014 is the symbol of righteous men.\u201dSardinha thus set forth to discover the \u2018destiny\u2019 of the Portuguese people, one that would be ruled by a regime suited to the characteristics of the Portuguese. This would not be a French style republic, nor another fake parliamentary democracy, de facto ruled by the capitalist elite; instead, it would be something else, informed by history and psychology. It would not be an effort at historical recreation but, as Sardinha put it, a\u00a0return\u00a0to something that should never have been interrupted, and it would be as if it had never been interrupted\u00a0at all. It was an organic, social monarchy, established as a democracy in its lower levels, a democratic municipality based upon the free association of communities and professions, followed by an aristocracy at the level of the administration of the state, a bureaucracy of merit and service, and on top the rule of the king, who acted as a ruler but not as an administrator.  Sardinha\u2019s ideas would evolve over the years. He even clashed with some of his supporters after publishing the infamous\u00a0A Quest\u00e3o Ib\u00e9rica\u00a0(1916), a book about the necessity of forming an alliance with Spain. His late political thought, however, seemed to have focused less on the dichotomy between monarchy and republic, as evidenced by the ties he formed with well-known republicans such as Ant\u00f3nio S\u00e9rgio. Sardinha\u00a0\u00a0and many integralists also cooperated with other conservatives, non-Catholic traditionalists, and leftist republicans to produce a magazine called\u00a0Homens Livres\u00a0(Free Men). Such prolific intellectual activity had its costs. By the end of his life, Sardinha\u2019s disciples were divided between those who supported authoritarian policies and those who wanted the implementation of true integralist policies. While recognizing Sardinha as a mentor,\u00a0Alfredo Pimenta\u00a0and\u00a0Caetano Beir\u00e3o, for example, quickly recognized Salazar and his conservative authoritarianism as a valid alternative. When the First Republic finally perished, giving way to the\u00a0Estado Novo\u00a0in 1926, despite frequently becoming the targets of censorship many integralists became staunch defenders of the new regime. Sardinha and the\u00a0Estado Novo We will never know if Sardinha, who died in 1925, would have been supportive of Salazar\u2019s\u00a0Estado Novo. He was certainly enthusiastic about many of the achievements and methods of Mussolini\u2019s Italian fascism, going so far as calling the Italian experience a \u2018fulfillment\u2019 of his own theories. However,\u00a0Alberto Monsaraz,\u00a0Jos\u00e9 Adriano Pequito Rebelo,\u00a0Jos\u00e9 Hip\u00f3lito Raposo, and\u00a0Francisco Rol\u00e3o Preto\u00a0\u2014 some of the most prominent successors of Sardinha in the leadership of the\u00a0Integralismo Lusitano\u00a0\u2014 would eventually come to criticize the\u00a0Estado Novo\u2019s institutions as mere formalities. These integralists were, in fact, the first victims of political persecution and censorship during the first years of the\u00a0Estado Novo, much more so than the republican left. Sardinha and his integralism envisioned parliamentary institutions that could represent citizens based on their regions and professions. He endorsed a corporatist chamber akin to that which had already been endorsed by many of the authors inspired by Catholic social teaching. To them, both the Portuguese\u00a0Estado Novo\u00a0and Italy\u2019s fascist state seemed to have failed in the creation of autonomous legislative bodies that could function without the guidance of partisan leaders like Mussolini or Salazar.  From what we know of Sardinha\u2019s methodical line of thought, this is a perversion of the\u00a0true\u00a0aim of such institutions \u2014 which is to function normally, as vigorous bulwarks of local, regional, and national traditions and independence. It thus would have been entirely unacceptable to him. Sardinha respected his country\u2019s institutions too much to settle for watching them becoming a mere tool for Salazar\u2019s projects. While not so important to Sardinha in his later years, even the failure to reinstate the monarchy only proved that, despite the fact that\u00a0Integralismo Lusitano\u00a0had formed and educated most of the political elites of the early stages of\u00a0Estado Novo,\u00a0the regime was ultimately a betrayal of Sardinha\u2019s teachings. Salazar\u2019s\u00a0Estado Novo\u00a0functioned under the premise of a \u2018normal existence.\u2019 However, there was nothing normal in the\u00a0Estado Novo\u2019s institutions. In 1970, In 1974, four years after the dictator\u2019s death, the\u00a0Estado Novo\u00a0would fall to a poorly organized coup d\u2019\u00e9tat without any type of relevant resistance on the behalf of its institutions. Sardinha dreamed of an Integralist Regime that could, like the traditional constitution of the Portuguese monarchy, withstand the passing of the ages, the incompetence of kings and rulers, and even the decadence of the national community. Instead, Salazar\u2019s\u00a0Estado Novo\u00a0\u2014 much like Mussolini\u2019s\u00a0Stato fascista\u00a0\u2014 fell as soon as its leader disappeared. Manuel Rezende\u00a0is a writer based in Porto.

                "text": "Italy\u00a0is a beautiful country. There are so many\u00a0reasons to go to Italy! Food is delicious. Art and culture are everywhere. Landscapes are breath-taking\u2026 Italy truly has it all. \n\n\n\nI am totally in love with Italy. I love everything about it. The food, the language, the landscapes, the culture\u2026 you name it! I\u2019ve been to Italy more times than I can count and it never gets old! Today, I want to share my passion for\u00a0Italy\u00a0with you. \n\n\n\nSo, let\u2019s get down to business and discover the best\u00a0places to visit in Italy.\u00a0 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nTable of Contents \n\n\n\nRome\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRome\u00a0is the capital of Italy and it was only fair it would come first! It\u2019s probably going to be your starting point in Italy, although it depends where you are flying from. \n\n\n\nRome\u00a0is the eternal city. History and culture are everywhere, it is one of the most beautiful cities you will ever get to see in your life.\u00a0 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs a matter of fact, little fun fact,\u00a0Rome\u00a0has only one twin city and it is Paris. This was done on purpose. According to the Italians, Rome is so beautiful that only Paris can equal it and therefore deserve to be twin city. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGoing to Rome, it\u2019s diving into over 2,000 years of history. From the Romans to the Italian Renaissance and modern times. Every stone, every street, every single piece of it is history.\u00a0 \n\n\n\nAmongst the best\u00a0things to do and see in Rome, you will find: \n\n\n\n\u2013 Spanish steps \n\n\n\n\u2013 Trevi fountain \n\n\n\n\u2013\u00a0Vatican museums and the sistine chapel \n\n\n\n\u2013 Peter\u2019s square and basilica \n\n\n\n\u2013\u00a0Colosseum \n\n\n\nAnd many more! \n\n\n\nIn terms of food, you have to try a typical roman Pasta Carbonara or go on a\u00a0food tour! \n\n\n\nPlan your trip to Rome\n\n\n\nWhere to stay in Rome:\u00a0The best places to stay in Rome would be the city centre (by the Spanish steps) but it can get quite expensive. Another option would be near the Coliseum. \n\n\n\nFinally, if you are looking for something different, the Trastevere will be the perfect neighbourhood for you! \n\n\n\nYou can find more information and the latest prices for hotels in Rome here. \n\n\n\nActivities in Rome:\u00a0There is plenty to do in Rome. A lot of attractions are free but you will have to pay an entrance fee for the\u00a0Coliseum\u00a0and\u00a0Vatican museums. If you want to make the best of your time, I highly recommend\u00a0booking a tour in Rome \n\n\n\nNaples\n\n\n\nNaples\u00a0is Southern Italy\u2019s jewel. One of the best cities I got the chance to visit. \n\n\n\nAfter all, they do say \u201cSee Naples and die\u201d. Alright, I know, initially they would say that to refer to the fact that Naples was the further Greek colony and when slave would reach\u00a0Naples\u00a0that would generally be the place where they\u2019d die. That having been said, it does work nowadays too to describe the fact that it is a beautiful city that you have to see at least once in your life! \n\n\n\nNaples\u00a0is a mix of many things. It\u2019s often described as dirty and chaotic. The truth is: it is dirty and chaotic! But that\u2019s part of what makes it so unique! \n\n\n\nIn\u00a0Naples, you get that feeling of freedom and \u201cdolce vita\u201d like nowhere else. \n\n\n\nNeapolitan food\u00a0is delicious! After all, it is the birthplace of pizza! You will find the best restaurants and street food at a very affordable price. \n\n\n\nPro tip:\u00a0A pizza margarita should cost about 3 to 4 euros. Use that as an indicator to see if the restaurant you are going to is good or a total rip off. If the pizza margarita is over 4 euros, that means that the restaurant is overpriced as a general thing. \n\n\n\nSome of the must-try Neapolitan foods are: \n\n\n\n\u2013 Pizza fritta (fried pizza) \n\n\n\n\u2013 All pizzas! \n\n\n\n\u2013 Neapolitan Baba \n\n\n\nNaples is also the perfect starting point to discover some of the best landmarks in Italy. From Naples, you can also visit: \n\n\n\n\u2013 Herculaneum \n\n\n\n\u2013 Capri \n\n\n\n\u2013 Amalfi Coast \n\n\n\nAnd many more! \n\n\n\nPlan your trip to Naples\n\n\n\nBook a hotel in Naples \n\n\n\nBook a tour in Naples \n\n\n\nPompeii\n\n\n\nPompeii\u00a0is located about 1 hour away from\u00a0Naples. It was one of the world\u2019s most interesting places! Pompeii was a fairly important city during Roman times but ceased to exist about 2000 years ago after the eruption of Mount Vesuvius. \n\n\n\nThe city was entirely covered by the ashes of\u00a0Mount Vesuvius\u00a0and remained a mystery for almost 1,700 years. The buried city was discovered in 1748 and excavations have been done ever since. \n\n\n\nNowadays you can visit Pompeii. You just need to take the Circumvesuviana train from Naples and in less than an hour, you will get there. \n\n\n\nPompeii\u00a0is a fantastic place to visit. It literally blew my mind. It\u2019s a real-life version of what a roman city was like. I loved it and can\u2019t recommend it enough. Especially if you like history. But even if you don\u2019t it\u2019s quite an experience. \n\n\n\nPompeii\u00a0is a fairly big city and you will need a full day ideally to go around it. There are so many interesting aspects and if you want to make the most of it, I\u2019d highly recommend going a\u00a0walking tour with a guide. There aren\u2019t that many signs and having a tour guide with you will help you understand what each element is and how the Romans were living. \n\n\n\nPompeii can get extremely crowded so I highly recommend to get there early in the morning, when it opens and/or to take a\u00a0skip the line ticket. \n\n\n\nIf you go between June and september, don\u2019t forget to take a hat. It\u2019s very sunny and hot. There is very little shade so better safe than sorry! \n\n\n\nSicily\u00a0\n\n\n\nFrom all places, Sicily has a very special place in my heart. There is no place quite like it. It\u2019s very unique and it definitely has it all. \n\n\n\nSicily, it\u2019s a mix between tradition, natural beauty and amazing food. What is there not to like?\u00a0 \n\n\n\nYou will find all sorts of landscapes and the best beaches in Italy. \n\n\n\nSicily is a land of sea and volcanoes. \n\n\n\nMount Etna and the\u00a0Aeolian Islands are a must do during any trip in Sicily.\u00a0 \n\n\n\nSeeing and walking onto active volcanoes is an experience itself but you will be amazed by the beauty of the landscapes.\u00a0 \n\n\n\nIn terms of beaches, you will not be disappointed. White sand and white cliffs are on the cards. Taormina, Sant\u2019Alessio, Fontane Bianche and the Scala dei Turchi are absolutely breath-taking. \n\n\n\nMount Etna\n\n\n\nItaly is home to the most active volcano in Europe, Mount Etna. If you love outdoor activities, it will be the perfect place for you! One of the best things to do at Mount Etna is going hiking! There are a lot of hiking options but it\u2019s highly recommended to go with a guide. You would get lost otherwise (speaking of experience!  ). \n\n\n\nGoing on a hike on Mount Etna was one of the most amazing experiences I had in my life. It\u2019s pretty amazing to see the contrast between landscapes and climates. \n\n\n\nIf you are staying in Catania, you will leave the seaside behind you in the morning to get Mount Etna. The hike starts in the forest but as you go up, you will see that the landscape changes drastically. You will get to a stage where it\u2019s a moon-like landscape with only volcanic stone and then, further up, you will find the snow. Yes! There is snow in Sicily! The higher you get on Mount Etna, the more mountain-like it gets. There is even a ski resort on Mount Etna! \n\n\n\nYou can also go up to the mouth of Mount Etna, perfect for people who want to see what being at the heart of an active volcano is like! Of course, this can only be done when it\u2019s not erupting. It\u2019s quite an amazing experience. The summit of Mount Etna is quite high which means that there is snow! But at the same time you can feel the heat from the earth, pretty bizarre and fascinating! \n\n\n\nPlan your trip to Sicily\n\n\n\nBook a hotel in Sicily \n\n\n\nSardinia\n\n\n\nSardinia is the perfect destination for beach lovers. \n\n\n\nIt\u2019s very similar to Sicily but yet so different. First of all, there are no volcanoes in Sardinia but it is still this typical Mediterranean island. A bit of a mix between Corsica and Sicily if you wish. \n\n\n\nYou will find beaches as pretty as in the Caribbean there! \n\n\n\nIf you go to the north of the Island, in the Maddalena Archipelago national park, you will even get to see the Pink beach! \n\n\n\nPlan your trip to Sardinia \n\n\n\nBook a hotel in Sardinia \n\n\n\nLa Maddalena Archipelago\n\n\n\nWhen it comes to beautiful islands and beaches in Italy,\u00a0La Maddalena Archipelago\u00a0sets the standard! \n\n\n\nThis beautiful national park located in the north of Sardinia is home to some of the whitest beaches in Europe. But that\u2019s not all! There is even a pink beach! You can\u2019t actually walk on this one as it is protected but you will be able to see it from the boat. Pretty awesome right? \n\n\n\nThe archipelago is made of 7 islands. You can get to Maddalena and Caprera island by ferry but the only way to visit the rest of the archipelago is to go on a cruise. There are many day cruises.\u00a0For more information and see the latest prices, head here. \n\n\n\nAlghero\n\n\n\nIf there is one thing that makes Sardinia so amazing, it\u2019s how authentic and traditional it is! Alghero is the best example of Sardinian authenticity. This old picturesque town is perfect for people who love to wonder. The streets are narrow, full of local boutiques, perfect to buy souvenirs! \n\n\n\nIt\u2019s also a great place to eat. There are many restaurants and gelato parlours. \n\n\n\nYou can also choose to walk along the promenade and visit the castle! \n\n\n\nStintino\n\n\n\nIf you are looking for white sandy beaches and turquoise waters, Stintino will be the place for you! \n\n\n\nThe most famous beach in Stintino is La Pelosa. Besides its crystal clear water, the thing that makes it extra cool is the tower that emerges from the sea! \n\n\n\nStintino is also home to many other beautiful beaches such as La Pelosa and Ezzi Mannu. \n\n\n\nVenice\n\n\n\nVenice is one of the most famous cities in the world and rightfully. \n\n\n\nVenice is a very unique city in every kind of way. Water is everywhere, architecture is beautiful and the way it\u2019s organised is unique. \n\n\n\nIt is one of the most romantic cities in the world and many couples get married there each day. \n\n\n\nThe main landmark is St Mark\u2019s Square and the sight bridge. \n\n\n\nThe best ways to explore Venice are by foot, as there are no cars there, but also by boat. \n\n\n\nThe vaporetti are bus boats and will bring you anywhere you need including to the colourful islands of Murano and Burano. \n\n\n\nIf you want to go for the full romantic experience, get onto a gondola! \n\n\n\nVenice can get very busy and smelly during the summer. The heat and water create a rather horrible smell. It is more recommended to go to Venice in spring or autumn. \n\n\n\nPlan your trip to Venice\n\n\n\nBook a hotel in Venice \n\n\n\nBook a tour in Venice \n\n\n\nFlorence\n\n\n\nFlorence is THE destination for culture lovers! \n\n\n\nIf you love architecture, museums and art, you will absolutely love Florence. Everything about it! \n\n\n\nFlorence is located in Tuscany, one of the most cultural regions in the world. \n\n\n\nIt\u2019s home to the Uffizi Gallery\u00a0 where you will get to see some very famous pieces such as David, The Birth of Venus, Medusa and many more. \n\n\n\nThe museum displays many pieces of Leonardo, Caravaggio, Michelangelo and Botticelli. \n\n\n\nIt\u2019s also the birthplace of the Italian Renaissance. The Duomo (cathedral) is absolutely magnificent! You can even go to the top if you wish. \n\n\n\nSome other famous Florence landmarks are: \n\n\n\nPonte VecchioDavidPalazzo VecchioPiazza della Signora\n\n\n\nIn terms of food, you will get to try: \n\n\n\nBistecca alla FiorentinaLampredottoPapardelle al CinghialeTagliatelle Funghi Porcini e Tartufo\n\n\n\nPlan your trip to Florence\n\n\n\nBook a hotel in Florence \n\n\n\nBook a tour in Florence \n\n\n\nPuglia\n\n\n\nPuglia is known as the \u201cheel\u201d of Italy and gathers the best that Southern Italy has to offer. \n\n\n\nStunning beaches, amazing food, authentic villages\u2026 Puglia has it all! \n\n\n\nIf you decide to go there, you will probably fly to Bari, the main city in Puglia, but I\u2019d recommend heading south to discover the true authenticity of Puglia.\u00a0 \n\n\n\nLecce, also known as the \u201cFlorence of the south\u201d is absolutely gorgeous and a must-do. \n\n\n\nPuglia gets more than 300 days of sunshine which means that it\u2019s a great destination at any time of the year. It is important to note though that it will get extremely hot in summer. \n\n\n\nPlan your trip to Puglia\n\n\n\nBook a hotel in Puglia \n\n\n\nLake Garda & Como\n\n\n\nLocated about 2 hours north of Milan, Lake Garda and Como are breath-taking clear water lakes by the italian Alps. \n\n\n\nIt\u2019s an ideal destination in summer, especially if you are travelling with kids. \n\n\n\nLake Garda is Italy\u2019s biggest lake and has so much to offer but don\u2019t forget to check out Lake Como that, although smaller, is just as beautiful. \n\n\n\nThe contrast between water and mountains is so refreshing! \n\n\n\nPlan your trip to Lake Garda\n\n\n\nBook a hotel in Lake Garda \n\n\n\nDolomites\n\n\n\nThe Dolomites are a range of mountains located in North-East Italy. This region burst with natural beauty and is must-do! \n\n\n\nThe peaks have a very unique shape, something you\u2019ve never quite seen anywhere else. \n\n\n\nIt is the perfect destination in winter if you like skiing and in summer if you want to go hiking. \n\n\n\nPlan your trip to Dolomites\n\n\n\nBook a hotel in Dolomites \n\n\n\nCinque Terre\n\n\n\nThe Cinque Terre are a national park located in Liguria, about 2 hours from Genoa and 3h30 from Milan. \n\n\n\nIt is one of the most incredible places to see in Italy. \n\n\n\nCinque Terre means \u201c5 lands\u201d and designates 5 villages located on cliffs. \n\n\n\nThe Cinque Terre are Monterosso al Mare, Vernazza, Corniglia, Manarola and Riomaggiore. \n\n\n\nThey are only accessible by train.

These linkages provided in this \u2018hint\u2019 format help you frame possible  questions in your mind that might arise(or an examiner might imagine)  from each current event. InstaLinks also connect every issue to their  static or theoretical background. This helps you study a topic  holistically and add new dimensions to every current event to help you  think analytically. \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Introduction: South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) in recent years: Thirty-six years after it first began, the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC), appears to be all but dead in the water. The year 2020 marked the sixth year since the leaders of the eight nations that make up SAARC were able to meet. Further evidence of its perilous position, if any was needed, came on  the SAARC charter day on December 8, where PM Narendra Modi made it  clear that India\u2019s position on cross-border terrorism from Pakistan that led India to refuse to attend the SAARC summit in 2016 in Islamabad, is still in place. This indicates that the grouping, which cannot convene unless all  leaders agree to meet, is unlikely to do so in the near future.\u00a0\u00a0     In recent years, the shadows over the meets: South Asia as a fragmented group: Over the past year, India-Pakistan issues have  impacted other meetings of SAARC as well, making it easier for member  countries, as well as international agencies to deal with South Asia as a  fragmented group rather than a collective, working with each country in separate silos or in smaller configurations.However, the events of 2020, particularly the novel coronavirus pandemic and China\u2019s aggressions at the Line of Actual Control (LAC) shone a new spotlight on this mechanism, and should make the India review its position and reverse that trend.India\u2019s problems with Pakistan on terrorism, territorial claims and on its role in blocking SAARC initiatives on connectivity and trade are well known.Even so, India\u2019s refusal to allow Pakistan to host the SAARC summit because of those problems is akin to giving Pakistan a \u2018veto\u2019 over the entire SAARC process.While China\u2019s incursions in Ladakh and the Galwan killings constituted the larger concern in the year, India did not decline to attend meetings with the Chinese leadership at the SCO, the Russia-India-China trilateral, the G-20 and others.No concerns over territorial claims stopped the Modi government from  engaging with Nepal either, despite Mr. K.P. Sharma Oli\u2019s decision to  change Nepal\u2019s map and Constitution to include Indian territories.Pandemic-caused challenges: Reviving SAARC is crucial to countering the common challenges brought about by the pandemic.To begin with, studies have shown that South Asia\u2019s experience of  the pandemic has been unique from other regions of the world, and this  needs to be studied further in a comprehensive manner (Pandemic Preparedness and Response to COVID-19 in South Asian Countries) in order to counter future pandemics.Such an approach is also necessary for the distribution and further trials needed for vaccines, as well as developing cold storage chains for the vast market that South Asia represents.The pandemic\u2019s impact on South Asian economies is another area that calls for coordination.Apart from the overall GDP slowdown, global job cuts which will lead to an estimated 22% fall in revenue for migrant labour and expatriates from South Asian countries,  there is an expected loss of about 10.77 million jobs and $52.32  billion in GDP in the tourism sector alone from the impact of COVID-19.World Bank reports that have estimated the losses have all suggested that South Asian countries work as a collective to set standards for labour from the region, and also to promoting a more intra-regional, transnational approach towards tourism, citing successful examples including the \u2018East Africa Single Joint Visa\u2019 system, or similar joint tourism initiatives like in the Mekong region or the Caribbean islands.A time for regional initiatives: Benefit from an \u201call-of\u201d South Asia approach: In the longer term, there will be a shift in priorities towards health security, food security, and job security, that will also benefit from an \u201call-of\u201d South Asia approach.The impact of COVID-19 will be seen in broader, global trends:  a growing distaste for \u2018globalisation\u2019 of trade, travel and migration  all of which were seen to have helped the pandemic spread from China, as  well as a growing preference for nativism, self-dependence and localising supply chains.While it will be impossible for countries to cut themselves off from  the global market entirely, regional initiatives will become the \u201cGoldilocks option\u201d (not too hot and not too cold), or the happy medium between globalisation and hyper-nationalism. It would be important to note therefore, that as the world is  divided between regional trade arrangements such as new United  States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, or USMCA (North America), the Southern  Common Market, or MERCOSUR for its Spanish initials (South America).The European Union (Europe), the African Continental Free Trade  Area, or AfCFTA (Africa), the Gulf Cooperation Council, or GCC (Gulf)  and Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership, or RCEP (South East  Asia and Australasia including China), India\u2019s only regional trading  agreement at present is the South Asian Free Trade Area, or SAFTA (with  SAARC countries).Conclusion: India\u2019s steps to be more bilateral: India stepped up its health and economic diplomacy in the region,  but apart from one SAARC meeting convened by India in March 2020, these  have been bilateral initiatives, not a combined effort for South Asia. These are some of the reasons that led all SAARC leaders other than India to urgently call for the revival of SAARC during their charter day messages. Despite the despondency, the rationale for its existence remains  intact: while history and political grievances may be perceived  differently, geography is reality. Seen through Beijing\u2019s prism, India\u2019s SAARC neighbourhood may be a means to contain India, with the People\u2019s Liberation Army  strategies against India over the LAC at present, or in conjunction with  Pakistan or Nepal at other disputed fronts in the future. India must find its own prism with which to view its South Asian neighbourhood as it should be: a unit that has a common future, and as a force-multiplier for India\u2019s ambitions on the global stage. \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 (With input from news agency language)  \u00a0If  you like this story, share it with a friend!

With most of the planet still in the grips of the pandemic and vaccines a long way off for so many of us, travelling for pleasure could be thought of as at best foolish, at worst, downright risky.   One thing we do know, however, is that this situation isn't forever. For some of us, escape could be a matter of weeks away. For others, it could be coming in the middle, or even the end, of the year.   But it will come eventually, and freedom to explore will be back in the cards.   It's in this spirit that CNN Travel has compiled its list of 21 places to visit in 2021. We're fully aware that some of these destinations may remain off limits for some time to come and that embarking on a trip may not be advisable.   But in an era where tourism is part of the global language, we'll continue to look ahead to the time when we can take our first tentative steps back out into the world and make good on those dreams we've been saving up.   With that in mind, we've assembled a collection of mostly blockbuster destinations that we think are going to be high on your travel wish lists. The 21 places YOU want to go.   These are not the obscure, or undiscovered gems that often populate places-to-go rundowns (although we did throw in a couple of unexpected spots). These are the solid-gold vacation hits that everyone needs right now.   To help with getting you there, for each destination we've also built a separate guide to what you need to know before you go, covering entry restrictions, current COVID-19 guidelines and safeguards, plus what kind of vacation you can expect when you finally make it.   See somewhere you like: bookmark the guide and keep checking back for updates. We'll keep you posted with all the latest developments as they happen.     Antarctica  With the cancellation of the 2020-2021 Antarctic cruise season, there is a lot of pent-up desire to make our biggest travel dreams come true.   One of the most remote destinations on the planet, Antarctica is not an easy (or affordable) endeavor under the best circumstances.   Perhaps the difficulty is part of the allure -- the seventh continent remains on the top of many travellers' wish lists. The striking white desert, with its dramatic, snowy peaks and vibrant turquoise waters, as well its exotic wildlife, including Emperor penguins and Weddell seals, is truly a once-in-a-lifetime experience.   Making the locale even more enticing in 2021 is a December 4 solar eclipse that will darken the continent, creating a major event for Antarctic cruise lines to trumpet.   Silversea's Silver Cloud 11-day sailing departs on November 30, with rates starting at US$20,520, with a 10% early booking discount and economy flights included.   Ponant's offering also departs on November 30, but for 15 days aboard the first luxury hybrid electric polar-class vessel, Le Commandant-Charcot, starting from $17,790.   For those who are trepidatious about cruising, there are other options, including one from UK-based Red Savannah that transports passengers across the continent via private jet over nine days, for about $100,000. -- Brekke Fletcher   Travelling to Antarctica during COVID-19: What you need to know before you go     Canada  Skiing, surfing, hiking, polar-bear spotting and Northern-lights sighting. Eclectic cuisine, world-class shopping, a diverse and rich culture. This is Canada.   The 13 provinces and territories that make up the world's second-largest country by total area has something swoon-worthy for every type of traveller.   Nature lovers take solace in mountains, glaciers, waterfalls and Atlantic or Pacific coastlines while sophisticated palates nosh at Michelin-starred restaurants and hole-in-the-wall mainstays alike.   Nightlife seekers will find vibrant club scenes in Montreal, Toronto and Vancouver, though smaller cities Edmonton and Calgary know how to play too.   The laid-back visitor has a bevy of chill choices: among them Tofino, Canada's original hippie destination; Kelowna, a picturesque lakeside wine country; and St. John's, one of the country's friendliest places.   In New Brunswick, the recently opened Fundy Trail Parkway boasts wild views of the Bay of Fundy coast and the world's highest tides.   Venture further north and it just gets wilder. Neither Nunavut nor Northwest Territories are easy to get to, but the rewards of visiting the remote regions -- from the indigenous Inuit people's artwork of the former, to the natural wonders (including unparalleled Northern Lights) of the latter -- are countless.   Hot hotel openings include the anticipated spring 2021 debut of W Toronto and Halifax's first five-star hotel, Muir Hotel. The property, set to open in August, will feature cold plunge and hydrotherapy pools with a halotherapy salt room. -- Stacey Lastoe   Travelling to Canada during COVID-19: What you need to know before you go     Disney parks  If it were up to most kids, every family holiday would include a visit to a Disney theme park. There's nothing comparable to the look of joy on a kid's face the second they step through the gates and lay their eyes on that gorgeous castle and get their first-ever photo with Mickey.   These days, adults can't be blamed for wanting to make a beeline to their nearest Disney park either, given the new \"Star Wars: Galaxy's Edge\" themed lands at both the Disneyland and Disney World resorts in the US -- open for less than a year before the pandemic hit. In particularly high demand is the Rise of the Resistance, the most ambitious interactive attraction in Disney park history.   Disney World's Epcot, meanwhile, has been going through a major transformation of its own, with more of these changes set to open in 2021. Perhaps most exciting is Remy's Ratatouille Adventure, a child-friendly ride due to open as part of the expansion of Epcot's France pavilion in the World Showcase.   And speaking of makeovers, on the other side of the planet Hong Kong Disneyland has been going through a big one. The Asian park recently revealed its dazzling new Castle of Magical Dreams, which has been under construction since 2018 and replaces its Sleeping Beauty Castle. Part of the park's ongoing multiyear expansion plan, it features a mix of architectural styles inspired by different cultures, while paying tribute to the multiple Disney princess stories. -- Karla Cripps   Travelling to Disney parks during COVID-19: What you need to know before you go     Dubai  While vacation planning for 2021 can seem like a wild roll of the dice, a trip to Dubai is a safer bet than most. The glitziest of the United Arab Emirates is currently welcoming almost all global travellers and, with the emirate embracing thorough safety checks and protocols, you can enjoy relative peace of mind while you're there too.   UAE flag carrier Emirates Airlines is offering free global coverage for COVID-19 health expenses and quarantine costs, while the legendary ocean-themed luxury resort Atlantis, The Palm will cover your COVID-19 test and give you resort credit if you stay five nights or more. Its billion-dollar sister hotel, The Royal, is also set to open its doors in 2021.   The long-awaited Expo 2020 Dubai has been rescheduled for October 2021 through March 2022 and the lavish mega-event is the first World Expo to be held in the Middle East. Visitors can expect world-class architecture, spectacular displays and a festival of food.   Also expected next year is the opening of the grandly named Museum of the Future, the calligraphy-adorned facade of which is already an impressive new landmark in a city known for its buildings with wow factor. -- Maureen O'Hare   Travelling to Dubai during COVID-19: What you need to know before you go     Egypt  Egypt's supply of ancient wonders is seemingly limitless, and 2021 may be just the year to show them all off to a world starved for cultural discovery.   Many of Egypt's most celebrated artifacts are finally expected to get a gleaming new home this year at the Grand Egyptian Museum (GEM) close to the site of the Pyramids of Giza.   The museum -- a monumental concrete and glass space measuring nearly half a million square meters with a price tag of over $1 billion -- was conceived in 2003 and has been under construction for eight years.   While the opening date has not been set, the long-delayed museum is sure to be a huge draw. A headliner: King Tutankhamun's treasures will all be exhibited together for the first time.   A number of sarcophagi from Saqqara -- newly discovered in 2020 -- will be transferred to the GEM, as will wooden coffins found in Luxor in 2019.   No doubt more new discoveries will be added to the lineup -- providing a deep dive into 5,000 years of history that can also be traced by trekking across Egypt to the tombs themselves. -- Marnie Hunter   Travelling to Egypt during COVID-19: What you need to know before you go     France  The bistros, boulangeries, patisseries and fromageries are reason enough to hotfoot it to France when the world starts moving in earnest.   And the rest of the things that drew nearly 90 million visitors to France in 2019 will start coming to life again too: world-class art exhibitions, elegant chateaux, towering cathedrals, medieval villages, glamorous stretches of coast and endless tangles of wine-producing vines.   With any luck, corks will be popping in June at the Bordeaux Wine Festival -- the largest in Europe, and hopefully the line-up at Jazz \u00e0 Juan in Antibes Juan-les-Pins in July will provide a fitting soundtrack to a summer showing signs of a return to communal life.   For a regal, live-it-up kind of stay, Le Grand Contr\u00f4le -- a historic hotel in the heart of the Ch\u00e2teau de Versailles with an Alain Ducasse restaurant and indoor swimming pool -- is set to open to guests in 2021. -- Marnie Hunter   Travelling to France during COVID-19: What you need to know before you go     Ghana  Its Year of Return initiative in 2019 targeted international visitors of African descent, and Ghana in West Africa is continuing to bank on diaspora tourism with its new campaign Beyond the Return.   Land and sea borders currently remain closed, but now is a good time to acquaint yourself with the country's hip cultural offerings, from an arts and fashion renaissance to new restaurant and hotel openings.   Adventurers can catch waves at deserted beaches at Cape Three Points, one of West Africa's best surfing spots, and may spot some humpback whales too. Mole National Park is Ghana's largest wildlife refuge and is where you can see Nolan warthogs and spotted hyenas and get close to ambling elephants.   Capital city Accra has little in the way of major attractions, but remains charming and lively. For a fashionable, cosmopolitan vibe head to Osu and the area surrounding the airport, where you'll find designer shops and art galleries. -- Maureen O'Hare   Travelling to Ghana during COVID-19: What you need to know before you go     Greece  If we do make it back to normality in 2021, Greece will have more reason than most to celebrate -- it's marking its 200th birthday. The official anniversary of when an 1821 revolution sparked a war of independence against the Ottoman Empire is in February-March, but parties and events to mark the bicentennial are expected -- COVID-19 permitting -- throughout the year.   The charming port of Nafplio, in the Peloponnese region southwest of Athens, is as good a place as any to join in the celebrations -- it was modern Greece's first capital. As well as beaches and nearby ancient sites like the remarkable Epidaurus amphitheater and the imposing ruins of Mycenae, Nafplio has its own attractions, including the hilltop Palamidi fortress, a secluded beach and, especially apt for these times, a museum of worry beads.   Beyond Nafplio, the Peloponnese are worth exploring. Less touristed than many of Greece's hotspots, they're more set up for social distancing, especially on the wild and mountainous Mani Peninsula. That said, most of Greece, which is known to take health matters very seriously, seemed to cope well with creating a COVID-safe visitor experience in the summer of 2020, succumbing to a virus surge far later than most European destinations.   While a slow return to normal might make previously overtouristed places like Santorini worth a look in 2021, there's no loss in playing it safe with a quieter option, like the island of Milos in the Cyclades -- a plane or ferry hop from Athens. This volcanic playground has a beach for every day of the month, with more than a few to spare. -- Barry Neild   Travelling to Greece during COVID-19: What you need to know before you go     Grenada  While Grenada's nickname comes from its famous nutmeg industry, the \"Isle of Spice\" is packed with flavor in every way possible.   Measuring just 18 kilometers wide and 34 kilometers long, the eastern Caribbean island is made up of sandy beaches, lush rainforests and spectacular waterfalls, but it's Grenada's rich character that sets it apart from more well-known tropical destinations.   Although each of its seven parishes has its own very distinct charm and appeal, Grenada's capital St. George's, known for its horseshoe-shaped harbor and colorful houses, is undoubtedly the most vibrant and picturesque.   St. George's is also home to many of Grenada's top hotels, including The Point at Petite Calivigny, a boutique wellness resort, which opened in late 2020, and Silversands Grenada, where visitors will find the longest infinity pool in the Caribbean.   The island has around 45 beaches, but Grand Anse is its most popular for good reason. Spanning three kilometers, this stunning stretch of white sand frequented by both visitors and locals offers tranquil waters, fantastic views and a wonderfully serene atmosphere. -- Tamara Hardingham-Gill   Travelling to Grenada during COVID-19: What you need to know before you go     Hawaii  Hawaii is underrated. This in spite of its unceasing popularity among travellers.   To be sure, it is a gorgeous place, with breathtaking sunrises and sunsets, and every beach seemingly prettier than the next, but its beauty goes much deeper than its preternatural appearance.   Extraordinary beaches -- some even boast black and green sand (Papak\u014dlea Beach and Punalu\u02bbu Beach, respectively) -- have their expected appeal, but visitors who take time to venture out and away from the coast quickly discover Hawaii's charms are in every nook and cranny.   On the island of Hawaii, a must-see is Hawaii Volcanoes National Park, where a spectacular new eruption of Kilauea has recently drawn visitors. As is a visit to N\u0101pali Coast State Wilderness Park on Kauai, which may turn even the most reluctant hikers into avid ones.   On Maui, after a few blissful days lounging at one of Wailea's top resorts (Hotel Wailea for adults and Four Seasons for the whole family), take the road to Hana, an epic, winding adventure where half the joy is stopping along the way -- to get the perfect shot or the most delicious tropical juice.   No matter which island you choose, which beachfront accommodation or which adventure, the key is slowing down and inviting the Aloha vibes to take over. -- Stacey Lastoe   Travelling to Hawaii during COVID-19: What you need to know before you go     Italy  Perennially popular Italy hit the headlines for all the wrong reasons in March 2020, when it became the global epicenter of the pandemic -- and after controlling infection rates better than most European countries over the summer, its aging population has been hit hard again by the second wave.   But nothing can dim Italy's attraction, and as restrictions ease, this will be a time to see it at its best. Pre-pandemic, Italy's art cities were notorious epicenters of overtourism.   But with visitor numbers not expected to return to 2019 levels for several years, for those who can make it safely, 2021 will afford the chance to see the Bel Paese in a way that hasn't been possible for decades.   What's more, the best known cities are trying to change tourism for the better. Having seen many of the tatty souvenir shops close in the pandemic, Venice, for instance, is focusing on promoting the city's traditional artisans, in a bid to readjust the tourism economy before the crowds come back.   Meanwhile, Milan's Pinacoteca di Brera -- one of Italy's showstopper (and queue-heavy) art galleries -- has vowed to keep entrance by pre-booking only, in order to give visitors more space, while Da Vinci masterwork \"The Last Supper\" is considering more same-day tickets to favor individuals rather than the big groups that usually book up slots months in advance.   Still social distancing? Italy has some of Europe's loveliest rural towns, and its alberghi diffusi (scattered hotels) are perfect for the COVID-19 era, putting you up in self-contained apartments dotted around villages. They're sustainable, too, helping to support smaller places in need of tourism. -- Julia Buckley   Travelling to Italy during COVID-19: What you need to know before you go     Japan  Though every tourism-dependent nation is certainly deserving of sympathy going into 2021, one can't help but feel particularly moved by the plight of Japan.   This is a country that hustled hard to ready itself for the 2020 Olympic Summer Games, only to have to cancel the event just as it was ready to showcase those efforts to the world.   Those postponed Olympic Games will kick off in Tokyo on July 23, 2021, giving travellers a chance to see some of the huge changes that have taken place, along with all the reasons we fell in love with the country in the first place. The food, the people, the culture ... Japan has a way of embedding itself into your soul and we can't wait to get back.   Major Tokyo additions include the Takanawa Gateway -- the first new station built on the city's key JR Yamanote train line since 1971. The area around busy Shibuya Station has also been revamped as part of a huge multi-layer makeover to cement it as the city's entertainment, transport and business hub for decades to come. Other changes of note include wider free Wi-Fi coverage not just in Tokyo but in the entire country -- including 108 Shinkansen \"bullet train\" stations.   Several new hotels opened this year as well, including the luxurious Kimpton Shinjuku Tokyo and the Four Seasons Hotel Tokyo at Otemachi.   But there's plenty to see elsewhere, too -- particularly for theme park fans. Our top pick? The new Super Nintendo World, which is due to open at Universal Studios Japan in Osaka in February 2021. -- Karla Cripps   Travelling to Japan during COVID-19: What you need to know before you go     Maldives  White sand beaches? Check. World-class dining? Yep. Incredible swimming, sailing and scuba diving? Got those too. Throughout the pandemic, Maldives has also managed to keep its borders open more than most thanks to the built-in social distancing offered by its luxurious resorts.   If anybody needed additional incentive to cross Maldives off of their bucket list in 2021, a spate of hotel openings is keeping things interesting. On deck for 2021 openings are new resorts from Ritz-Carlton, Patina, Le Meridien, Capella and Radisson Blu.   Next year will also mark a world's-first country-wide loyalty program: the Maldives Border Miles program will allow visitors to earn points based on how often they visit and how long they stay. After all, the only thing better than visiting is visiting twice. -- Lilit Marcus   Travelling to Maldives during COVID-19: What you need to know before you go     Mexico  This U.S. neighbour to the south was a respite for many in 2020, in spite of the closure of land borders between the U.S. and Mexico and multiple surges in coronavirus cases.   Air travel into and out of Mexico never really stopped, owing to the country's limited COVID-related travel requirements, plus its natural beauty, breathtaking coastlines and a wide swath of relatively under-touristed locations beyond hotspots like Puerto Vallarta, Cancun and Cabo San Lucas.   While balancing physical and economic health has been an uneven juggling act the world over, the fact is Mexico and many other destinations are in dire need of tourism revenue.   Looking into fall 2021, which hopefully will be a much less complicated time to visit, Mexico City will be celebrating its quincentennial, commemorating its founding 500 years ago, with most festivities planned in September to coincide with Mexican Independence Day.   Later in the fall, Formula 1 racing fans can attend the 2021 Mexico City Grand Prix on October 29-31 at the Aut\u00f3dromo Hermanos Rodriguez. -- Brekke Fletcher   Travelling to Mexico during COVID-19: What you need to know before you go     New Zealand  \"Otherworldly\" -- a term often applied to New Zealand's eye-popping, Hobbit-friendly landscapes -- has taken on new meaning when it comes to this South Pacific jewel.   Unlike vast swaths of the rest of the world, many of life's normal activities have resumed in New Zealand, thanks to one of the globe's most successful pandemic responses   The island country of five million has all but stamped out coronavirus, logging just over two dozen COVID-19 deaths. While its borders are closed to most travellers at present, we expect a lot of pent-up demand from people in all corners of the world salivating over images of its boundless terrain and return to relative normalcy.   Who doesn't need a bit of forest therapy in Waiheke right now? Or some star-gazing on Stewart Island? The world is still wide and wonderful and this country serves nature up on a heaping platter with rich ties to local Maori culture and history. -- Marnie Hunter   Travelling to New Zealand during COVID-19: What you need to know before you go     New York City  Start spreading the news, reports of New York City's \"demise\" have been grossly exaggerated. While the city has no doubt been adversely affected (what place hasn't?) over the last year, the city that never sleeps has high hopes for a better 2021.   A lot of New York's best offerings remain accessible, despite the ongoing pandemic (two major closures still in effect as the new year dawns are Broadway and indoor dining). And while New York City is rarely referred to as an \"outdoor wonderland,\" the truth is the best way to experience the city is walking through its distinct neighborhoods, maybe even with a slice of pizza in hand.   One of the best views of lower Manhattan can be seen while strolling across the Brooklyn Bridge, and New York City's waterfront and parks are always there for you to explore.   Some seminal cultural institutions, such as the Metropolitan Museum of Art, can be experienced with timed-ticketing -- and without the usual crowds.   To add to the excitement, there are two highly anticipated luxury hotel openings.   Luxury brand Aman will make its New York debut in the Crown Building on Fifth Avenue and 57th Street, with 83 rooms, a 65-foot swimming pool, Japanese and Italian restaurants, cigar bar and rooftop terrace with views of Central Park, which is just a short stroll away.   All the way on the West Side, along the Hudson River near the High Line, the new Six Senses New York is slated to open inside The Xi -- two new twisting towers designed by architect Bjarke Ingels. The brand's first North American hotel boasts 136 rooms and suites and a spa spanning 45,000 square fee with a vibroacoustic meditation dome. -- Brekke Fletcher   Travelling to New York City during COVID-19: What you need to know before you go     Singapore  Most travellers don't want to spend any more time in an airport than they have to. But Singapore's Changi is no ordinary airport.   While the rest of the world was hunkering down at home, Singaporean locals were paying to hang out at Changi, whether it was co-working in one of the lounges or glamping alongside the world's tallest indoor waterfall at the Changi Jewel, which opened in 2019.   The coming year is a chance to fall back in love with travel, and a visit to the Lion City should rekindle that romance.   Beyond its spectacular airport, the city-state is home to a UNESCO-listed botanical garden, one-of-a-kind Peranakan culture, and some of the world's most spectacular luxury hotels.   Its food scene is a major highlight -- whether visitors opt for $5 Hainan chicken rice from a hawker stall or $500-per-plate Michelin-starred fine dining, nobody ever goes home hungry. -- Lilit Marcus   Travelling to Singapore during COVID-19: What you need to know before you go     Spain  Spain, with its miles of picturesque sandy coastline and vibrant historic cities, has always been an unmissable travel destination.   Barcelona's Las Ramblas may have been emptier than usual this year, while the party ground to a halt in the beach bars of the Balearic Islands, but Spain's tourism hotspots are preparing to wow visitors once again.   Barcelona, like other European cities plagued in recent years by overtourism, has taken the time out to reevaluate how visitors can continue to enjoy the city without making it uninhabitable for locals.   The Balearics, meanwhile, are repositioning themselves with far more than iconic nightlife: secluded bays, a plethora of wildlife and sumptuous Mediterranean meals enjoyed al fresco will be the top attractions for visitors when they return.   Plus, by next summer, Spain's fiestas -- outdoor parties featuring fireworks, parades and celebration -- might be back, and what better way to mark new beginnings than toasting 2021 under the Spanish sun? -- Francesca Street   Travelling to Spain during COVID-19: What you need to know before you go     Thailand  For more than a century, Thailand has woven its spell on the masses with its glittering temples, fiery food, stunning beaches and mountainous landscapes.   All of that's still there -- plus a little more. The country has been heavily promoting domestic tourism in recent months, meaning there's been no shortage of new hotel and restaurant openings -- particularly in the capital, Bangkok.   The city's historic riverside Charoenkrung area recently welcomed two new luxury hotels -- Capella and the Four Seasons Bangkok -- while nearby Yaowarat -- aka Chinatown -- continues to evolve with the addition of wonderfully eclectic bars and boutique hotels. Our favorite? Quirky riverside bar and restaurant Baan Rim Naam.   For those with their eye on Thailand's south, the government is reportedly considering reopening Maya Bay, which has been closed since 2018 as part of a program aimed at reviving the area's decimated corals.   Though not yet confirmed, the stunning cove made famous by \"The Beach,\" the 2000 film starring Leonardo DiCaprio, may welcome visitors in mid-2021, but with strict visitor caps. -- Karla Cripps   Travelling to Thailand during COVID-19: What you need to know before you go     United Kingdom  \"Plague Island\" isn't likely to be top of anyone's travel hot list, but let's try to see past the unfortunate sobriquet applied to Great Britain by The New York Times after a new strain of virus led to many countries severing travel connections with the U.K.   The first place in the world to approve the coronavirus vaccine will hopefully, by the coming summer, have shaken off its notoriety. What should emerge is one of the world's top tourism offerings, but very different.   The U.K.'s recent Brexit from the EU will see the country's tourism sector happier than ever to see foreign visitors, particularly given that those arriving from Europe may face more bureaucracy than before to travel here.   Brexit, plus the financial impact of the pandemic, may mean many Brits choosing to staycation this year, although some may splurge on an overseas escape after months of enforced lockdown. But the good news for foreign visitors is that a widely expected slump in the pound should make the U.K. great value for money.   While the country may seem like a small collection of islands, it still offers wide open spaces for those still wary of crowds. There are the hills and waters of the picture-perfect Lake District, the dramatic coastline paths of Cornwall and Wales, the Highlands and Islands of Scotland and even the pretty scenery at the end of London's Underground lines. -- Barry Neild   Travelling to the U.K. during COVID-19: What you need to know before you go     Uruguay  As neighbors Brazil and Argentina have struggled to contain the pandemic, laid-back little Uruguay has kept infection rates down -- and as South America starts reopening for travel, that will serve it well.   Not that this is some kind of consolation prize; Uruguay has always had a huge amount to offer visitors, but as the continent's second smallest country, it has often been dwarfed in the tourism stakes by its behemoth neighbors.   The current summer season (December-March) has effectively been cancelled, with the government vowing to keep borders closed to stop infection rates rising. But once they reopen, there's a huge amount to discover.   New to Uruguay this year? You'll be blown away by its Atlantic coastline, with some of the most pristine beaches you'll ever have seen -- and a superb variety of accommodation, from beachside glamping to lagoon-floating cabins, chi-chi country retreats and architecturally cutting edge bungalows, plonked in the middle of a vineyard.   Punta del Este is one of the Americas' buzziest beach resorts, while Jose Ignacio, an hour up the coast, is a boho (but exclusive) resort. Carmelo, near the Argentinian border on the River Plate, is a laid-back weekend destination for Argentinians. It's known for its wine -- and the once-quiet Uruguayan wine scene is going from strength to strength.   Much of the buzz is around Jose Ignacio and Garz\u00f3n, just inland, which is seeing a crop of vineyards opening up, like Bodega Garzon -- owned by billionaire Alejandro Bulgheroni -- Bodega Oceanica Jose Ignacio, plus Vina Eden and Sacromonte, both in nearby Pueblo Ed\u00e9n (tour the vineyards or try their wares at Solera, Jose Ignacio's superb wine bar).   New for 2021 will be Costa Garz\u00f3n, linked to the Bodega -- a new coastal development with a restaurant by celeb chef Francis Mallmann, beach club, hotel and private lots -- and pretty hotel Posada Ayana, which, in November, will unveil a Skyspace by James Turrell -- the renowned artist's first freestanding work in South America. -- Julia Buckley   Travelling to Uruguay during COVID-19: What you need to know before you go   Keep an eye on our individual destination guides for updated information on openings, travel rules and more.

                "text": "The Idhun Chronicles \u2013 Picture: Netflix \n\nThe Spanish anime series The Idhun Chronicles (or Memorias de Idh\u00fan as it\u2019s known in Spanish regions) will not be returning for season 3 or part 3 as it\u2019s named on Netflix according to the creator of the series, Laura Gallego. Here\u2019s what we know.\u00a0 \nSeason 1 which was commissioned as 10 episodes split into two parts (hence why we\u2019re referring to season 3 which would otherwise be part 3) adapted the first book of The Idh\u00fan\u2019s Memories from Laura Gellego. The second and third book which could\u2019ve been adapted are: \n\nMemorias de Idh\u00fan II: Tr\u00edada\nMemorias de Idh\u00fan III: Pante\u00f3n\n\nZeppelin TV produced the series for Netflix with Netflix distributing the show exclusively globally. \nPart 1 arrived on September 10th, 2020 with the second season dropping on January 8th, 2021. \n\nSo will we be getting a part 3 (season 3) or just future episodes in general? The answer looks to be no. Laura Gellego who wrote the original books answered to fans queries on the same day season 2 dropped stating that \u201cNo more seasons are planned. The adaptation was only for the first book.\u201d adding in another Tweet later \u201cNo agreement has been reached to adapt the following books, sorry.\u201d \n\nHola, no est\u00e1 previsto que se hagan m\u00e1s temporadas. La adaptaci\u00f3n era solo para el primer libro. \n\u2014 Laura Gallego (@_LauraGallego) January 8, 2021 \n\nThe reason as to why Netflix isn\u2019t going to move forward is not officially known. We do know based on previous renewals it\u2019s often down to how many people start the show and h0w many finish the show. Promotion for the series was very low with not even a trailer being uploaded onto the official Netflix channels for part 2. \nAs FormulaTV notes, however, the had been controversy in the series production in the lead-up to release with last-minute casting changes for which the author didn\u2019t approve of. \nA full statement can be found here specifically about the dubbing in the Spanish version but we\u2019ve translated here: \n\n\u201cIn autumn 2018, a casting was carried out between professional voice actors to interpret the characters of the anime series \u201cMemories of Idh\u00fan\u201d, in its Spanish version. I was allowed to participate in the final selection of this casting and we had already chosen the cast of voice actors who would voice the characters. Some time later, and unexpectedly, some of these actors were replaced by others with no experience in dubbing. \nI want to clarify that from the first moment my wish was that all the characters in the series were played by actors specialized in dubbing. Those responsible for the series had other preferences regarding dubbing in Spanish and it was their criteria that prevailed at the end. Therefore, I would like to point out that these specific voices are not the ones I had imagined for my characters.\u201d \n\nReviews for both seasons haven\u2019t been too kind either with it currently sitting at a 5.3 on IMDb and not much buzz created online for the series either. \nAre you disappointed Netflix won\u2019t be continuing the story of The Idhun Chronicles? Let us know in the comments down below. \n\n \n \nFile source \nThe post \u2018The Idhun Chronicles\u2019 Not Returning for Season 3 at Netflix \u2013 What\u2019s on Netflix appeared first on Times News Express.",

                "text": "Also known as cr\u00e8me caramel, flan is a creamy custard made from eggs, sugar, milk, and sometimes vanilla. It has a crystallized caramel topping and is perfect for special occasions. \nBefore serving, the baker inverts the plate with the cooking dish and removes the baking dish, allowing the caramel to trickle down for a beautiful presentation.\u00a0 \nThese days, flan is one of Latin America\u2019s most popular desserts, but it was a healthy food during the Roman Empire\u2019s dominion. They believed it could increase fertility, help the kidneys, reduce UTIs, and soothe the chest. \nOrigins of Flan\nWhen the ancient Romans figured out how to breed chickens for eggs and meat, they quickly found they had more eggs than needed. This surplus led to the development of many new dishes. \nThese dishes include the dessert that we know of as flan. Back then, however, it was savory rather than sweet. Until they began adding honey, the dish had peppered eel as the primary ingredient. \nAs the Roman Empire expanded into Europe, they brought the dish with them. New versions and recipes sprung up in many regions, but Spain took a particular interest. \nSpanish and Mexican Flan Origins\nThe Spanish took the standard egg, cream, sugar, and milk recipe and added a sweet caramel sauce on top. It soon became a beloved Spanish dessert, and conquistadors introduced it to the indigenous Mesoamericans. \nWhat Mexicans did with the dish took it a step further, and they did it so well that flan is arguably known as a Mexican dessert. With flavors like coconut, chocolate, and coffee, the recipes circulated to Latin America, and their popularity grew even more.\u00a0 \nCookbooks from the 1600s are the first instance of published flan recipes. There are two types of flan in these books, \u2018stirred\u2019 and \u2018still.\u2019 \nFor stirred custards, the egg mixture needs consistent stirring on a stovetop or over a fire until almost coming to a boil. By cooking in a water bath, still flan results in a thickened liquid and sometimes goes with a pastry-like crust. \nSince meat was more accessible during the Renaissance, they enjoyed both sweet and savory variations of these egg custards.\u00a0 \nFlan Around the World\nCoconut Flan\nAlthough the Roman Empire eventually fell, the dessert eventually known as flan stuck around. Because of this, many countries have a unique take on it.\u00a0 \nCroatia\nRose liqueur gives this variation its name of \u2018rozata.\u2019 Flavorings such as vanilla provide a more modern interpretation. \nPuerto Rico\u00a0\nFlan from Puerto Rico\nPuerto Rico has unique flan recipes just for Thanksgiving and has numerous variations in general. With an egg and milk base, the whites and yolks of the eggs mix with the sugar separately. \nThe Thanksgiving flan has pumpkin, ginger, sweet potato, vanilla, and cinnamon. Other flavors in Puerto Rico include pina colada, chocolate, mango, sesame seed milk, lemon, guava, Spanish lime, tamarind, cassava, sweet plantains, and more. \nIndia\nIn Mumbai, they have homemade caramel pudding. Cities on the coast and former Portuguese colonies enjoy a caramel custard. Masala chai is a common addition as well, especially at beach resorts or in the homes of various Indian communities. \nPortugal\nPudim, made with vanilla, eggs, milk, and caramelized sugar, has a hole in the center and can have various additions. Orange or lemon, port wine, bacon, cinnamon, and pineapple are just a few of them.\u00a0 \nJapan\nCr\u00e8me caramel in Japan is a packaged custard pudding called purin. Taiwanese convenience stores also carry these treats. \nPeru\nPeru\u2019s Crema Volteada\nWith the meaning of \u2018flipped cream,\u2019 crema volteada sometimes has condensed milk. Fruit flavors are popular, such as soursop, custard apple, lucuma, and granadilla. \nSpain\nSpanish Flan\nSpain embraces most varieties of flan, but flan de huevo is most well-known. An almond nougat called turron is also a common flavoring. \nMalaysia\nIntroduced to the dish by the Portuguese, caramel custards sell year-round. Not only are they sold in restaurants, cafes, and hotels, they are also popular dishes for breaking fast during Ramadan.\u00a0 \nBrazil and Venezuela\nPudim de Leite\nQuesillo in Venezuela and pudim in Brazil, flan in these regions is condensed milk, eggs, and condensed milk with caramelized sugar on the top. Cheese, chocolate, and coconut are just a few of the flavors they use as a twist.\u00a0 \nVietnam\nThe French introduced their cr\u00e8me caramel to the Vietnamese, and their variation includes black coffee poured on top. In the North, they call it b\u00e1nh caramel, and in the South, b\u00e1nh flan. \u2018Burnt caramel\u2019 is also a popular method, letting it cook for just a bit longer. \nMexico\nTraditional Mexican Flan\nMexico is the place for flan, and it\u2019s everywhere. They have a variation with cream cheese called flan Napolitano that is creamier than classic. \nDominican Republic\nDominican Flan\nMade with only egg yolks, the vanilla, condensed milk, and evaporated milk make up the Dominican Republic\u2019s flan. Quesillo is the name for their coconut-flavored flan. \nChile\nLeche Asada, or roasted milk, is cr\u00e8me de caramel with a less smooth texture because it\u2019s baked directly in the oven.  \nThis method results in a more toasted surface layer. Another version, dulce de membrillo, has condensed milk and quince jelly.\u00a0 \nPhilippines\nWith their dish known as leche flan, Filipinos cook their their variation in oval-shaped tin molds called llaneras. They have more egg yolks and condensed milk, so the consistency is much thicker than the Spanish type. \nThe molds steam over an open flame or stovetop and sometimes bake into steamed cupcakes or pastries. Leche flan is a staple dessert for celebrations. \nCuba\nCuban Flan Dessert\nTwo egg whites and a cinnamon stick are Cuba\u2019s take on the famous postre. Flan de Cuba can also have a rum raisin or coconut topping. \nArgentina\nArgentinian Flan\nThe Argentinian flan goes with dulce de leche and sometimes even whipped cream.\u00a0 \nCosta Rica\nCalled flan de cafe, this dessert usually has a coffee or coconut flavor. \nHow to Make Flan\nMaking Flan\nWhile there are many, many recipes and types of flan, the general cooking method is the same.  \nUsually, there is the custard and the caramel sauce, along with whatever else to mix it up. Also, the inversion of the dish onto a platter is a necessity. \nFlan Recipe\nThe following recipe is a basic, straightforward version of classic flan.  \nThere is an impossible number of other recipes, and it may be worth it to take a few and make something new out of them. \nIngredients\n\nOne cup of sugar\n\u00bc cup of water\nFive eggs\nOne 14-ounce can of sweetened condensed milk\nOne 12-ounce can of evaporated milk\n1 \u00bd tsp of vanilla extract\n\nSteps\n\nPreheat the oven to 325\u00b0 Fahrenheit.\nFor the caramel sauce, combine the water and the sugar in a saucepan and turn the heat to medium. To mix, swirl the mixture rather than stir, and let it cook until boiling begins.\nLower the heat and let it cook for ten to 15 minutes. Continue swirling on occasion. When there is a rich, golden brown color, it\u2019s time to move on.\nPour this syrup into eight ramekins or a singular cake pan, if desired. However, be cautious with a cake pan so the flan can easily split in a later step.\nPlace the ramekins inside of a heatproof roasting pan, and leave them to the side.\nNext, combine both milks, vanilla, and eggs in a food processor or blender until smooth. Avoid making it too frothy.\nPour the custard over the caramel in the ramekins or pan.\nIn a kettle, bring some water to a boil. Before filling the roasting pan halfway with the boiling water, place the pan in the oven.\u00a0\nCover with tin foil and let it cook for around an hour, or until it\u2019s just set, with a slight jiggle.\u00a0\nGet rid of the water from the bath, and let cool completely. It\u2019s enjoyable at room temperature and chilled in the refrigerator.\nWhen serving, use a spatula around the ramekins\u2019 or pan\u2019s bottom, and invert them onto a plate carefully.\n\nNow you\u2019re ready to create your own version of this signature Latin dessert! \nThe post Flan, Spain & Latin America\u2019s Classic Caramel Custard Dessert appeared first on The Best Latin & Spanish Food Articles & Recipes - Amigofoods.",

                "text": "With on-line virtual academies becoming more commonplace, you could have requested yourself, \u201cIs it possible for children to get hold of a proper schooling on-line?\u201d My opinion may additionally differ from others, however, I even have researched several online schools, thru their websites, and shaped some generalizations which I think must be understood earlier than enrolling any scholar. This article isn\u2019t always meant to be an overview of any particular college, but instead a precis of common characteristics I have located among numerous online colleges. The colleges you do not forget might also differ from their teaching tactics and practices. Consumers should continually completely research any faculty, whether brick-and-mortar or virtual, before enrolling their kids. Of path identifying whether or not a web schooling is proper for your infant is a choice, you and your baby should make collectively. However, I advise a few alternatives to don\u2019t forget before enrolling your infant in an internet college. The generalizations and options I located are listed below. \nSchool may be damaged down into its simple additives, which, in the author\u2019s opinion, includes 4 things; \n1. Teacher-pupil interplay \n2. Curriculum three \n. Student-student interaction and \n4. Feedback (Grading). \nLet\u2019s have a look at each of these additives and the way every is carried out within a standard on line program \n1. Teacher-pupil interplay (coaching). Most on-line colleges do now not offer real-time teacher-led instruction. Instead, they offer curriculum substances which must be reviewed and studied independently with the aid of the scholar. The pupil in the end submits the substances for grading, and receives a response from the trainer. Most applications offer a few form of tutoring through the trainer thru email or chat. Most packages are asynchronous (scholar and trainer no longer collectively at the equal time.) This gives the gain of a more bendy time table in which a pupil can participate in other sports or applications and entire training and assignments at differing schedules. The disadvantage, but, is that this system may additionally seem impersonal, such as strongly old fashioned correspondence courses. Many college students grow to be discouraged from this type of instruction, where others can also enjoy the flexibility. The key to achievement in this sort of program, specially for younger college students, is robust parental support. Parents ought to assume to keep kids on the right track with the aid of overseeing training, and even assisting if need be. Some programs provide a actual-time chat rather for scheduled stay lessons. In the actual-time chat, students and teacher meet synchronously (on the identical time) in a chat room and the students are allowed to ask questions and receive a response. This gives an advantage of live interaction with other human beings, but the chat have to have a \u201cwhiteboard\u201d to be had so that the trainer can truly illustrate ideas, specially for math and technological know-how publications. \nREAD MORE : \n\nFive Top Tips For Learning Spanish With Online Tutoring\nHigh School Home School \u2013 All About Homeschooling\nA Good Choice For Home Education \u2013 Online Home Schooling\nFive Reasons to Home School From an Educator\u2019s Perspective\nHome Schooling in High School: Making a Four-Year Plan\n\n2. The next a part of any faculty is its chosen curriculum. Of direction, many dad and mom have non secular choices and there may be an abundance of curricula obtainable to guide maximum choices, specifically if the own family is Christian. For many parents, that is the primary issue using them to pick a private education for his or her kids. Parents should be certain that the curriculum may be tailored to each college students needs, and that it meets standards for his or her state. It is a superb idea to be positive that the pupil will get hold of the specified kingdom-mandated coursework earlier than choosing a faculty, due to the fact, specially for the high school guides, they will discover too late that the pupil has no longer met kingdom requirements for graduation. The right information is that maximum curricula are tailored to fulfill nation requirements, and the parent has little need for concern here. Special needs students are often exempt from these necessities and might benefit from a custom-tailored program that may be selected in a virtual faculty. Parents need to be cautious, but, while enrolling children in better-stage coursework. Be certain that tutoring is available as a part of this system, with a \u201cwhiteboard\u201d inside the classroom chat. If this option is not available, I might suggest that purchasers turn away from these kinds of applications, because the discern may additionally find himself or herself spending more money for non-public tutoring, which defeats the cause of buying the virtual education in the first location. \nThree. Student-scholar interplay or socialization. We\u2019ve all heard so much approximately socialization. What is all the hype truely approximately, and is it applicable to online training? The solution is yes, yes, and yes. People need different people, and people taking on-line publications can sense very isolated. Most digital faculties provide college students the opportunity to engage with each other in a web chat. Some even offer a \u201cvirtual global\u201d which resembles a actual college campus in a video game sort of environment. Students who revel in gambling video games may enjoy the latter choice. Parents ought to be sure that they\u2019ve time to help their kid\u2019s academic needs with out of doors sports like sports activities, clubs, and so on. There are generally home school groups in any place and people attending a digital college could without a doubt locate themselves in like business enterprise at these meetings. Consider locating a neighborhood chapter and getting worried. Students who meet frequently with other college students in the region will sense like part of a collection in an awful lot the same way as those attending a regular school. Students who sit down domestic on my own all day will most clearly suffer from the isolation. \n4. The very last thing important to any simple instructional software is teacher feedback or grading. This thing is vital in order that the pupil is aware of how properly he or she is doing within the program, and which regions of examine may additionally need paintings. Virtual programs may additionally offer immediately feedback for curriculum components which may be graded routinely. There should surely be a few live input, however. Parents need to ask whether or not lessons receiving a bad grade can be repeated. Sometimes computerized grading structures may be much less that foolproof and a stay trainer should be to be had and inclined to review even the automatic answers. Be positive to ask approximately this crucial region of this system. \nParents have pretty some options whilst considering an internet application, and it\u2019s far feasible to discover one that suits you and your pupil exactly. Many college students and parents are glad with this academic alternative. These people find that an internet software enables to keep them on course and offers the assist they want for extra tough or time-ingesting subjects. \nParents who\u2019re considering this feature can also promote themselves brief, but, if they do no longer consider homeschooling their kids as an alternative of purchasing an online schooling. Many virtual faculties make use of the exact same curriculum alternatives which might be to be had to domestic schoolers. Several of those curricula are taken into consideration to be \u201cself-coaching,\u201d meaning that each lesson is carefully planned and supplied in a package that builds on statistics formerly discovered, but does not require the student to study or talk over with that cloth to complete the lesson. Several \u201ccurriculum-in-a-field\u201d options are to be had to domestic schooled college students which provide a complete 5-situation set for each level. Electives are also available. Those considering virtual training may additionally recall the use of this sort of curricula coupled with outside tutoring services whilst vital. There are numerous of those curriculum options available to homeschooling households, and a comparison is beyond the scope of this text. Since the discern will discover him/herself tracking and guiding every day pupil instructions and sports with either choice, a few college students may higher succeed in a homeschooling software which offers direct tutoring support rather than impersonal on line interplay. Money stored from now not shopping the digital faculty software may be used for investment the tuition offerings. If the mother and father feel relaxed answering most questions themselves, as opposed to hiring a train, in addition economic advantage can be found out from the homeschooling choice. \nOf course, parents ought to constantly refer to local and/or kingdom homeschooling regulations. If homeschooling is chosen, mother and father are required to register their pupil with a regulating authority. This is also required in a few states if a virtual school choice is selected. In a few states students are allowed to check in with the digital faculty simplest. \nCongratulations for your choice of in search of an opportunity instructional placing in your child! Whichever software you select, make sure it gives the blessings and help you want as a circle of relatives to acquire achievement. I desire you success in whatever choice you make collectively.",

                "text": "Even though plastics have existed for only about a century, its products have spread around the globe. Latest findings estimate that every year about 13 million ton plastic waste is discarded in the oceans. This marine plastic wastes have not only created global environmental problems but are also found to have adverse effect on economy, health and culture. \n\n\n\nIt takes hundreds of years for these plastic wastes to decompose; however, during this time, they get disintegrated into smaller sizes creating micro-particles which have a diameter of less than 5\u2009millimeter. These microplastic particles have a damaging effect on marine organisms and products, and are considered as global environmental pollutant. Numerous scholars have stated the presence of microplastics in various marine and freshwater products such as clams, fulmars, mussels, marine and freshwater fish. Several products consumed by humans are obtained from the sea. Microplastics can contaminate these products and enter our body. For example, European shellfish consumers are seen to ingest up to 11,000 plastic particles every year. Moreover, these microplastics have recently been discovered in deep-sea creatures, indicating the exposure of deep sea to human plastic waste. \n\n\n\nSome of the important products obtained from the sea are: \n\n\n\nPrecious stones, gems and\u00a0pretty collectibles such as seashells and sea glassMaterials used in household products such as kelp and sea spongesIngredients of skin care products for example red and brown algae, and seaweedProducts with medicinal properties like coralsSea sand used in construction industryEdible salt, a very important food ingredientOil and gas for household, industrial and transportation usageCopper, nickel, silver, platinum and gold from deep sea mining\n\n\n\nOne of the most important products obtained from the sea is salt, in which the primary constituent is sodium chloride, but also has around 0.5 to 10% (concentration may vary in commercially available salts) of other salts like calcium, potassium, and magnesium salts of chloride and sulfate. Salt is the principle source of sodium ions which is essential for maintaining nerve and muscle function and is also involved in the regulation of body fluids, blood pressure and blood volume, and thus plays significant role in maintaining good human health. \n\n\n\nManufacturing process of salt consists of pumping saltwater into evaporation ponds, and concentrating it by the action of sun and wind. This leads to formation of salt crystal bed which is cut and subjected to various physical processes before its packing. \n\n\n\nSeveral types of salts according to their origin are: \n\n\n\nSea saltLake saltRock saltRiver or well salt\n\n\n\nThe occurrence of microplastics in saltwater bodies, sea creatures and even in human bodies is relatively well studied, but its presence in edible commercial salts has been reported only recently. Some of the works published are: \n\n\n\nIniguez et al. analyzed 21 commercial table salts from Spain comprising sea salts and also well salts, before and after packing. They determined about 50\u2013280\u2009microplastic particles per kg salt, which were predominantly polyethylene-terephthalate, polypropylene and polyethylene.Karami et al. extracted microplastic particles larger than 149\u2009\u03bcm size from 17 different salt brands obtained from 8 countries followed its identification using micro-Raman spectroscopy. They discovered 1 to 10microplastic particles per kg of salt, which were mostly common polymers such as polypropylene and polyethylene having mean particle size of about 515\u2009\u03bcm.Gundogdu tested 16 brands of table salts, for microplastics, obtained from the Turkish market using microscopic and Raman spectroscopic examination techniques, and determined 16-84 microplastic particles per kg in sea salt, 8-102 microplastic particles per kg in lake salt and 9-16 microplastic particles per kg in rock salt; wherein, most common polymers were polyethylene and polypropylene.Kim et al. hypothesized that the presence of microplastics in commercial sea salts can act as indicators of its pollution in the surrounding environment unless these are filtered out during production. They investigated 39 commercial salt brands from geospatially different sites \u2013 16 countries/regions on six continents, and determined 1674 microplastic particles per kg in sea salts, 148 microplastic particles per kg in rock salt, and 28\u2013462 microplastic particles per kg in lake salt; wherein, highest content was identified in sea salts produced in Asian countries/regions.Yang et al. collected 15 different types of salts such as sea salts, lake salts, and rock/well salts from supermarkets throughout China, and found 550\u2212681 particles/kg in sea salts, 43\u2212364 particles/kg in lake salts, and 7\u2212204 particles/kg in rock/well salts; which were predominantly fragments and fibers.Seth et al. collected samples from eight brands sea salts in India, and determined concentrations of microplastics ranging from 100 to 50\u2009particles kg\u22121 of salt, which were mostly polyesters, polyethylene terephthalate (PET), polyamide, polyethylene, and polystyrene having fragments size smaller than 500 \u03bcm.Lee et al. utilized fourier transform infrared spectroscopy to determine concentration of microplastics in Taiwanese commercial table salt and found about 9.77 microplastic particles/kg of the same, and were identified as polypropylene, polyethylene, polystyrene, polyester, polyetherimide, polyethylene terephthalate, and polyoxymethylene.Tahir et al. examined 7 Indonesian sea salts and discovered them to be contaminated with 54 particles/kg of the salt which were majorly polyvinyl acetate (41.7%), polyethylene (33.3%) and polystyrene (25%).\n\n\n\nThus, it can be confirmed from above studies that even the salt we eat is contaminated with microplastics, hence we can say that those who don\u2019t eat seafood have also consumed microplastics in all probability. This is really alarming! \n\n\n\nSome of the points to be discussed further could be: \n\n\n\nHow can the salt production technique be improved to eliminate microplastics in salts?Can a study be performed to find microplastics in final packed salt product sold at the retail stores?Can a study be performed to find microplastics in final consumed food product, which has this salts added in them?At what rate this microplastic particles are increasing or decreasing every year?\n\n\n\nDear Readers, do go through the above literature and let me know your viewpoints in the Comments section. \n\n\n\nThanks for reading! \n\n\n\nI put up a new post whenever I come across an interesting topic, so follow my blog and stay updated about the developments in the polymer industry. \n\n\n\nReferences: \n\n\n\nI\u00f1iguez, Maria E., Juan A.

Found in the Rocky Mountains \nNevada is really state within the western associated with United https://samedayinstallmentloans.net/payday-loans-wa/ States Of America. Found in the Rocky Mountains, hawaii gets its title through the snow-covered hill range: \u0432\u0402\u045aNevada\u0432\u0402\u045c may be the Spanish for \u0432\u0402\u045asnow-covered\u0432\u0402\u045c. It really is referred to as the \u0432\u0402\u045aSilver State\u0432\u0402\u045c. Mainly, it owes the title to your development regarding the Comstock Lode together with rush that is silver accompanied it. Additionally, it\u2019s called \u0432\u0402\u045athe Battle Born State\u0432\u0402\u045c, given that breakthrough more or less put it in the center of the Civil War and contributed to the state\u0432\u0402\u2122s delivery. The state\u0432\u0402\u2122s biggest urban centers are Carson City (the main city), Las vegas, nevada, and Reno. \nNevada is fabled for its lenient regulations: there\u2019s absolutely no individual tax and tax that is corporate. Additionally, the state\u0432\u0402\u2122s government opposes any work by the government that is national prohibit 24-hour purchase of liquor and showing up in general public places in a situation of intoxication. \nAlthough gambling is strictly controlled by the U. S. legislation, gamblers feel good here too, especially descendants of aboriginal Indian tribes, several of who, contrary to the law that is federal are permitted to have and run gambling enterprises. \nGeography\nNevada is situated in the truly amazing Basin Desert and contains the minimum quantity of rain in america. Hawaii edges on Ca towards the west, south-west and south, Utah towards the eastern, Idaho and Oregon to your north. This has a acutely diverse landscape with many plateaus, valleys, woodlands, and sandy desert areas. \nNevada Cash Advance Law and Legislation\nPay day loan landers are another group of company, who\u2019re quite nicely of utilizing the Nevada that is lenient legislation. Tribe financing enterprises can be found in Nevada, that are run by the alleged indigenous American tribal federal government. There are not any loan or APR quantity restrictions. It ought to be noted, but, that the mortgage size must not go beyond 25% of a family group\u0432\u0402\u2122s gross month-to-month earnings. This is why Nevada an attraction for loan providers, yet sets borrowers have reached an elevated risk of dropping as a financial obligation trap. \nIn Nevada, pay day loans are formally referred to as \u0432\u0402\u045ahigh-interest loans\u0432\u0402\u045c and \u0432\u0402\u045adeferred deposit loans\u0432\u0402\u045a. The utmost loan term is 35 times, also it can\u2019t be extended for over 60 times. \nNevada Direct Pay Day Loan Loan Providers\nPayday financing businesses are available in Nevada\u0432\u0402\u2122s major towns and cities: vegas, Carson City, Henderson and Reno. The greatest people have numerous workplaces round the state. Included in these are Check City, Fast Money, Advance America and Quik Money. These firms claim to operate for the advantage of residents, whoever cannot boast an income that is high have reached threat of financial hardships. \nIt would appear that people in Nevada appear less likely to make an application for a cash advance: about 20per cent of households have actually yearly earnings of $50,000 to $75,000, and median annual individual income quantities to $31.694. With typical house value amounting to $254 521, this indicates quite easy for a grouped family members to purchase a home. Nonetheless, the interest in payday financing solutions may be explained by the odds of unforeseen bills and costs (because of accidents, medical issues, etc.). \nNevada Pay Day Loans Statistics\nThere are about 95 licensed lenders that are high-interest Nevada with around 300 offices. at the time of 2016, they granted about 440,000 high-interest loans, about 837,000 deferred deposit loans and almost 520,000 name loans. It is often believed that charges alone which are moved from Nevada\u0432\u0402\u2122s populace each 12 months, total around $182,000,000. \nNevada Loan Drains\nBecause Nevada\u0432\u0402\u2122s law is very therefore free on payday lenders and makes many of them desire to be predatory using their consumers. The total cost drain in Nevada is $182,569,531, comprising an overall total of car-title ($104,843,696) and total cash advance ($77,725,835) costs drained from clients.  \nWhom Can Apply for an online payday loan in Nevada?\n Because of the freedoms that are legal lenders enjoy, borrowers should really be more careful and make certain they can pay off on time. Payday lenders tend not to ever be really strict on credit histories. However, they\u2019ve been thinking about getting their funds straight back, and so the many requirements that are common: \nToday Nevada\nIn the last years, Nevada witnessed a quantity of financial upheavals as a result of the mining sector that is declining.
