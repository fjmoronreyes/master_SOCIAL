If not, 12 \n\n\nI\u2019ve read 34, started several more that I didn\u2019t finish.  (And I have to really dislike a book to not finish.  I\u2019ve read books I hated all the way through just to make sure I was t wrong.  But I just couldn\u2019t finish Confederacy of Dunces. ) \n66\u2026but also is hamlet there if the complete works of shakespeare is also there?  No interest in the other 34 tbh \nJust so you know most of this list have been made into really good movies, tv shows and even animation and you can skip the 900 pages of exposition (and some of these books are utter shite. Heart of darkness is \u201cafrica is a country, it is savage and will make you savage, here\u2019s a bunch of racist gore. the end\u201d). Cold Comfort Farm is a hilarious film full of top notch actors that you WILL quote to your friends. Pretty much every Austen, Shakespeare and Dickens has a good modern adaptation. The best of Wuthering Heights was captured by Kate Bush\u2019s song LOL. Alice in wonderland contains so many in jokes about the time it was written that it comes across as gibberish and adaptations tend to go with trippy when it\u2019s more like saturday night live if it followed a main character. If you can watch a Muppet adaptation of any of these: DO IT, they are good. If an Alexandre Dumas adaptation is cast with only white people they missed the blaring memo, so seek out the tv or euro version instead. For Sherlock Holmes, anything except BBCs Sherlock\u2019s terrible fanfic. If you watch Lord of the flies, remember that it\u2019s about how boarding school rich boys are trained to be vicious little narcissists.\nDon\u2019t let folks say that Ulysses has to be read, I recommend looking up the Yes scene on youtube with captions on.    // I had a period of reading everything i could from age 7-16 then couldn\u2019t read without a magnified screen so I\u2019ve been listening to or watching the media if I absolutely had to know*a cultural reference \ninstead (many of these are very tedious poverty/rich people porn that can benefit from a fast forward button for real). //  Ones to actually read:   The Little Prince is a short children\u2019s book for adults that will stick with you, Winnie the pooh is also a delightful little read. Lolita doesn\u2019t translate to screen, the goal of the book is to occasionally manipulate you into feeling sorry for a child rapist monster but looking for the clues to who Dolores is and how she\u2019s doing is an interesting mystery, there\u2019s also a scathing indictment of american consumerism as happiness but it\u2019s heavy painful stuff so don\u2019t read unless you\u2019re ready and feel free to quit no judgement. Dracula has yet to be remade as delightfully nohomo-veryhomo as the original so if you watch the movies imagine the dudes are hitting on eachother with every threat. Anything by Dostoyevsky is part philosophy musings so adaptations that follow the stories are missing the fun parts (yeah I said what i said: skip the story). Read whatever Bill Bryson is close to home, he\u2019s a travel writer. Geisha, a life is the real story stolen and badly mangled for Memoirs of a geisha.   Most importantly: Don\u2019t feel you have to read \u201cthe classics\u201d. You absolutely do not have to finish a book you don\u2019t like. A lot of these were written for their time as a political message (the fact that many are still relevant is just sad). If you believe that racism is bad, the police aren\u2019t doing justice if they protect property and power over human lives, our leaders often don\u2019t live up to their promises, a living wage is good, rich people do dumb stuff with their boredom and war isn\u2019t fun well you can cross off most of the list and go enjoy some romance and adventure instead. Get the recap or watch the movie if you\u2019re required to pretend you\u2019ve read them.",

M\u00e1s de un mill\u00f3n de ejemplares vendidos.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\u00abTodav\u00eda recuerdo aquel amanecer en que\u00a0mi padre me llev\u00f3 por primera vez a visitar\u00a0el Cementerio de los Libros Olvidados.\u00bb \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUn amanecer de 1945, un muchacho es conducido por su\u00a0padre a un misterioso lugar oculto en el coraz\u00f3n de la\u00a0ciudad vieja: el Cementerio de los Libros Olvidados. All\u00ed,\u00a0Daniel Sempere encuentra un libro maldito que cambia el\u00a0rumbo de su vida y le arrastra a un laberinto de intrigas y\u00a0secretos enterrados en el alma oscura de la ciudad.\u00a0La\u00a0Sombra del Viento\u00a0es un misterio literario ambientado en la\u00a0Barcelona de la primera mitad del siglo xx, desde los \u00faltimos\u00a0esplendores del Modernismo hasta las tinieblas de la\u00a0posguerra.  Aunando las t\u00e9cnicas del relato de intriga y suspense, la\u00a0novela hist\u00f3rica y la comedia de costumbres,\u00a0La Sombra del\u00a0Viento\u00a0es sobre todo una tr\u00e1gica historia de amor cuyo eco se\u00a0proyecta a trav\u00e9s del tiempo. Con gran fuerza narrativa, el\u00a0autor entrelaza tramas y enigmas a modo de mu\u00f1ecas rusas\u00a0en un inolvidable relato sobre los secretos del coraz\u00f3n y el\u00a0embrujo de los libros cuya intriga se mantiene hasta la\u00a0\u00faltima p\u00e1gina. \n\n\n\nEl Juego del \u00c1ngel\n\n\n\nLa pr\u00f3xima vez que quieras salvar\u00a0un libro, no te juegues la vida\u2026\u00a0Te llevar\u00e9 a un lugar secreto\u00a0donde los libros nunca mueren.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEn la turbulenta Barcelona de los a\u00f1os 20 un\u00a0joven escritor obsesionado con un amor imposible\u00a0recibe la oferta de un misterioso editor para escribir\u00a0un libro como no ha existido nunca, a cambio\u00a0de una fortuna y, tal vez, mucho m\u00e1s. Con estilo deslumbrante e impecable precisi\u00f3n\u00a0narrativa, el autor de\u00a0La Sombra del Viento\u00a0nos\u00a0transporta de nuevo a la Barcelona del Cementerio\u00a0de los Libros Olvidados para ofrecernos una\u00a0gran aventura de intriga, romance y tragedia, a\u00a0trav\u00e9s de un laberinto de secretos donde el embrujo\u00a0de los libros, la pasi\u00f3n y la amistad se conjugan\u00a0en un relato magistral. \n\n\n\nEl Prisionero del Cielo\n\n\n\nEscribo estas palabras en la esperanza\u00a0y el convencimiento de que alg\u00fan d\u00eda\u00a0descubrir\u00e1s este lugar\u2026 un lugar que\u00a0cambi\u00f3 mi vida como estoy seguro de\u00a0que cambiar\u00e1 la tuya.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBarcelona, 1957. Daniel Sempere y su amigo Ferm\u00edn,\u00a0los h\u00e9roes de\u00a0La Sombra del Viento, regresan de nuevo a\u00a0la aventura para afrontar el mayor desaf\u00edo de sus vidas. Justo cuando todo empezaba a sonre\u00edrles, un inquietante\u00a0personaje visita la librer\u00eda de Sempere y amenaza\u00a0con desvelar un terrible secreto que lleva enterrado dos\u00a0d\u00e9cadas en la oscura memoria de la ciudad. Al conocer\u00a0la verdad, Daniel comprender\u00e1 que su destino le arrastra\u00a0inexorablemente a enfrentarse con la mayor de las\u00a0sombras: la que est\u00e1 creciendo en su interior. Rebosante de intriga y emoci\u00f3n,\u00a0El Prisionero del Cielo\u00a0es una novela magistral donde los hilos de\u00a0La Sombra del\u00a0Viento\u00a0y\u00a0El Juego del \u00c1ngel\u00a0convergen a trav\u00e9s del embrujo\u00a0de la literatura y nos conduce hacia el enigma que\u00a0se oculta en el coraz\u00f3n del Cementerio de los Libros\u00a0Olvidados. \n\n\n\nEl Laberinto de los Esp\u00edritus\n\n\n\nEl desenlace de la saga de\u00a0La Sombra del Viento.\u00a0Recordar\u00e1s por qu\u00e9 te gusta leer.\u00a0\n\n\n\nEn la Barcelona de finales de los a\u00f1os 50, Daniel Sempere ya no es aquel ni\u00f1o que descubri\u00f3 un libro que habr\u00eda de cambiarle la vida entre los pasadizos del Cementerio de los Libros Olvidados. El misterio de la muerte de su madre Isabella ha abierto un abismo en su alma del que su esposa Bea y su fiel amigo Ferm\u00edn intentan salvarle. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJusto cuando Daniel cree que est\u00e1 a un paso de resolver el enigma, una conjura mucho m\u00e1s profunda y oscura de lo que nunca podr\u00eda haber imaginado despliega su red desde las entra\u00f1as del R\u00e9gimen. Es entonces cuando aparece Alicia Gris, un alma nacida de las sombras de la guerra, para conducirlos al coraz\u00f3n de las tinieblas y desvelar la historia secreta de la familia\u2026 aunque a un terrible precio. \n\n\n\nEl Laberinto de los Esp\u00edritus\u00a0es un relato electrizante de pasiones, intrigas y aventuras. A trav\u00e9s de sus p\u00e1ginas llegaremos al gran final de la saga iniciada con\u00a0La Sombra del Viento, que alcanza aqu\u00ed toda su intensidad y calado, a la vez que dibuja un gran homenaje al mundo de los libros, al arte de narrar historias y al v\u00ednculo m\u00e1gico entre la literatura y la vida. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCarlos Ruiz Zaf\u00f3n\n\n\n\nBarcelona, 1964 Los \u00c1ngeles, 2020 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCarlos Ruiz Zaf\u00f3n\u00a0(Barcelona, 1964-Los Angeles, 2020) es uno de los autores m\u00e1s reconocidos de la literatura internacional de nuestros d\u00edas y el escritor espa\u00f1ol m\u00e1s le\u00eddo en todo el mundo despu\u00e9s de Cervantes.

Not because of where I was found \u2013 only a few people know about that. They call me Yanka the Bear because I am so big and strong. \n\n\n\n\nFound abandoned in a bear cave as a baby, Yanka has always wondered about where she is from.

                "text": "Do you have a favourite book? Is it long, short? Did you read it at a time that was poignant? Is it a book about love that you read after a breakup? A book about an apocalyptic virus that you read last year?!! Or is it a favourite from childhood that still has you turning the pages and laughing, screaming, crying, in all the same places? Well, whatever it is - and speaking to the readers and writers I know, it seems that most of us do have a favourite, or at least a top five that's forever fluid because we just can't decide in which order to place them - I've decided to reread some of my favourites (Harry Potter excluded). I'll need a bit of filler though because there's some big old tomes here - that copy of, The Stand in the picture, is one thousand four hundred and twenty pages, so I won't be going for volume (I read forty-one books last year so I'll be lucky to make half that this) but needs must. Clive Barker is an author from my childhood and his ability to create worlds that seem so fantastical but so real, is both startling and brilliant, so I intend to revisit his superb, Imajica - which, along with his Weaveworld and Two Books of the Art, The Great and Secret Show and Everville are amongst those that have influenced my own writing more than any. Having supped on the delights of Frenchman's Creek and My Cousin Rachel in recent years it feels like an age since I read Rebecca and its sequel, Mrs de Winter (did you know it had a sequel?) as does my last visit to Hobbiton, to Frodo, Gandalf and Sam, in a book that needs no introduction, that I first read as a teenager and understood a lot more as an adult (but that was near on twenty years ago now) so again, the need to dip one's toes in the waters of the Brandywine river and share that epic adventure again has begun to outweigh the compulsion to read something new. There's nothing wrong with something new of course. I have never completed Stieg Larssons's Millennium trilogy, so this will be part reread and part first read, as will reading Stephen King's Dark Tower for the first time, having reread the first six books over the last year or two, so I'm not completely mad, I have got some new (to me anyway) books lined up for the coming year. There's the latest Rivers of London book, False Value to read, before the next one comes out, Malorie, the sequel to Bird Box - which you might know from the film of the same name - the final book in the unbelievably superb Cemetery of Forgotten Books series, The Labyrinth of the Spirits (which I'm probably looking forward to the most) and a whole host of others that I'm sure will steer me from my path, but you can rest assured I'll keep you all posted, whatever happens. Happy reading folks and stay safe. Don't forget to search my blog for your favourite authors and books and if I haven't read them yet why not message me with your recommendations.",
