Image provided by the Northeast Regional Climate Center.\n\n\n\nTemperatures will remain mild compared to normal today, but we\u2019ll have plenty of clouds once again as a weak upper-level disturbance moves across the region. It may produce a sprinkle or flurry in spots, but for the most part, we\u2019ll remain dry. We\u2019ll clear out tonight, then Tuesday will feature some sunshine and cooler temperatures as high pressure builds in. Some clouds will likely develop, because that\u2019s just the way things have been this winter \u2013 we can\u2019t seem to get a completely clear day, even when it looks like we should. \n\n\n\nEven with high pressure building in, we\u2019ll still have some clouds around Tuesday afternoon. Image provided by Weathermodels.com\n\n\n\nAnother weak disturbances moves through Tuesday night and early Wednesday with more clouds and possibly a few snow showers, but even colder air will start to filter in behind this system. Some clearing is possible Wednesday afternoon as the system moves away, but another quickly system follows for Thursday into Friday. This may produce some snow showers, but right now, we\u2019re only expecting light accumulations, if that. That system will strengthen as it moves into Atlantic Canada, producing gusty northwest winds around here over the weekend as high pressure builds in, which will result in much cooler weather moving in. It does look like the colder weather will hang around through much of next week, so it will start to feel like winter once again. \n\n\n\nTemperatures are expected to below normal across a large portion of the Northeast next week. Image provided by WeatherBell.\n\n\n\nMonday: Some morning sun, then becoming mostly cloudy, chance for a sprinkle or a flurry, breezy. High 39-46. \n\n\n\nMonday night: Clearing. Low 20-27. \n\n\n\nTuesday: A mix of sun and clouds. High 33-40. \n\n\n\nTuesday night: Partly to mostly cloudy with a few flurries possible. Low 22-29. \n\n\n\nWednesday: Plenty of clouds, maybe a few flurries in the morning and a few afternoon sunny breaks, breezy. High 29-36. \n\n\n\nThursday: Partly to mostly cloudy with scattered snow showers. High 28-35. \n\n\n\nFriday: More clouds than sun. High 35-42. \n\n\n\nSaturday: Partly to mostly sunny, windy, and colder. High 29-36. \n\n\n\nSunday: Sunshine and a few clouds, breezy. High 27-34.",

                "title": "Should the NFL Call Games Due to Weather?",
                "text": "Arrowhead Stadium in the snow.Photo of\u00a0by Tristan via TwitterAccuWeather\u00a0recently published an interesting article and poll on the subject of the NFL and its policy of playing most games during adverse weather. Before I make my suggestions I want to make a couple of clarifications.\u00a0 The 2018 Miami-Tennessee game was delayed by lightning, not just by rain.\u00a0NFL games are\u00a0rescheduled in event of a hurricane. They did just that in 2005 when Hurricane Wilma threatened a Chiefs v Miami game.\u00a0My opinion: Things should continue as they are. NFL games should continue to be played in the snow and cold and similar conditions. It is part of the tradition of the game. However, I would make two changes:Lightning delays often last too long in both college football and the NFL. This is due to the both using outdated science.\u00a0As the article points out, there is far too much risk and disorganization when combining tornado risks and football stadiums full of fans.\u00a0With regard to the latter hazard, there was a very close call at Iowa State University in 2005 when a damaging tornado passed within three miles of the stadium. The result was a mis-mash as this article explains:Based on the approaching storm, at 4:45pm LST officials ordered an evacuation of the stadium based on a \"scenario1\" event,\" urging people to seek shelter in their cars to avoid lightning and\u00a0hail. At this same time, a tornado was reported 8 miles southwest of the stadium. That information resulted in\u00a0a \"scenario 2\" evacuation being ordered by 4:50 pm LST, and fans instead were told to seek shelter in large buildngs, most a 5\u201310-minute brisk walk away, stadium concourses, restrooms, and ditches. [The photo] shows the IEM webcam at 5:01pm LST from the ISU campus, one mile from the stadium, as a tornado caused F2 damage 3 miles NW of the stadium. More than10,000 people took shelter in the university\u2019s Hilton Coliseum, with several thousand more walking to other buildings. Even larger numbers, however, remained outside and unsheltered.\u00a0 If 80,000 people are in a stadium, a 10-15 minute tornado warning will not suffice. In this era of mesoscale meteorological modeling, a game should be delayed or cancelled hours in advance when there is a high risk of tornadoes in the vicinity. If anything but the very weakest of tornadoes strike a stadium with thousands of people on the property there is a real chance of mass casualties.\u00a0 The ISU incident is one of several incidents in the new millennium: there was the 2004 near miss near the end of the Indy 500 and, the terrible deaths and maiming that occurred at the 2011 Sugarland Concert at the Indiana State Fair when fair officials and law enforcement disregarded warnings of high winds.\u00a0 The 2021 tornado season is right around the corner. If you run a venue or a sports team, I perform professional consulting in the field of safety during extreme weather and invite you to call.",

Evan hopes you all enjoy seeing his manly whiskers! He and all of us here also hope you have a happy Monday!   ***Flashback Doodle of the Day    ***Tip of the DayEspecially if you live in an area prone to snow, ice, wind, and other wintry goodness, do be sure to think ahead and plan for any related emergencies. For example, should a blizzard be expected to blow through and potentially leave you snowed in, ensure that, prior to the winter storm, you stock up on your furbaby's food, medications, and other necessities. Another potential winter weather emergency includes power outages. One thing to help combat that is of a course a generator. If you have a generator, do be sure to have it checked as needed, to ensure its functionality and safety. Not everyone can or does have a generator, though, and in this case make sure you take other precautions to prep for potential power outages in the winter. Again, of course, make sure you are stocked up on your kitty or pup's food, medications, and so forth. Also have blankets at the ready. If you have a fireplace, have it regularly checked, cleaned, and rendered safe for use. A fireplace can of course be perfect source of heat in the event of a power outage, but it should be checked for safety, and should of course also be set up so that no furbabies can reach or be injured by the fire. Also, if there are safe places to put them well out of the reach of furbabies, candles being lit throughout the house could also potentially lend a bit of heat as well as light.  In some cases, especially in the event of lengthy power outages, it may be necessary to find a warm place to stay away from your powerless, cold home. If this is the case, ensure that you again have food, medications, and all necessities properly prepared for your kitty or pup. Then, of course, it is crucial to find somewhere that is pet-friendly for your furbaby to stay. This could be a hotel that is pet-friendly, or a family or friend's home where your furbaby is allowed, and that is also a pet-safe home. If necessary, such as if you cannot find a hotel or home that is pet-friendly for the duration of your home's power outage, you could also look into a pet boarding facility that you trust, and that of course has power and heat. During the winter months, snow, ice, and wind can wreak all sorts of havoc, so do be sure to consider how this could affect your furbaby, and have plans in the event of potential winter emergencies.",

                "title": "Mild Winter So Far, But Colder With Snow Close to Sea Level Ahead",
                "text": "9:30pm Sunday\u2026 \n\n\n\nHere we are in mid-January, halfway through meteorological winter (December-February).  We\u2019ve had ONE significant weather event during that time west of the Cascades; the wind and rain storm earlier last week.  It has been a very mild winter as well.   By the way, I just confirmed the peak gust at PDX was 50 mph during the last minute of January 12th (11:59pm).  \n\n\n\nDecember 1st through January 16th has been the WARMEST 1ST HALF OF WINTER ON RECORD IN PORTLAND!  You like that big red font?  This comes with one big caveat.  Portland has grown tremendously and we have an \u201curban heat island\u201d now.  It\u2019s most noticeable at night.  A lot more people live here compared to 60 years ago.  That means even if the climate was not warming (it is), we would be seeing Portland\u2019s average temperature rising due to that effect alone.  But check out Redmond (little/no urban influence there).  It\u2019s the warmest since 1951!  And Olympia has seen the 3rd warmest after 1951 & 1981.  Going back 100 years, Salem has seen its 5th warmest first half of winter.   My point is that yes, it has been a very mild winter\u2026so far.   \n\n\n\nSnowpack is well below normal, running about 60-80% of average in the Cascades.  Yet 2018, 2012, & 2011 La Nina years saw similar or lower snowpack at this point around Government Camp.  Many of these years we play \u201ccatch-up\u201d with snowpack in February/March.  We\u2019ll see. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOf course weatherwise it\u2019s been a very slow winter (again) for forecasters but we think that will be changing as we head into a colder weather pattern.  And yes, we may be flirting with low-elevation snow at some point in the next 10 days. \n\n\n\nQuick Summary\n\n\n\nThe next 7 days will be much drier than average, it\u2019s possible we don\u2019t seen any rain until NEXT SundayThere\u2019s no sign of an \u201carctic blast pipe-buster\u201d for at least the next 10 days.  That is a big shot of cold air from Canada; think lows in teens or lower and highs around 30 or below.  I don\u2019t see that happening.Beginning next Sunday, expect a cold & wet weather pattern with heavy Cascade snowfallBeginning next Sunday, we may see our first widespread foothill and Coast Range snow plus there may be more beyond that.   This winter, sticking snow below 2,000\u2032 has been rare.  That will change for the final week of January.   If you live between 1,000\u2032 and 2,000\u2032, you can expect to see snow more regularly beginning next Sunday.AT THIS POINT, we do not have (sticking) snow in our forecast (for lowlands) through at least next Sunday.  That\u2019s because we don\u2019t see a setup that would drag sticking snow all the way down to the valley floor, or sea level.  But it may be close to sea level at some point in the 7-10 day range.  Keep a close eye on that Sunday-Tuesday forecast NEXT week.\n\n\n\nWhat\u2019s Changing?\n\n\n\nWe have a strong upper-level ridge right over us and it\u2019s staying put through Wednesday.  This is the flow of air up around 18,000\u2032 (500mb). I\u2019ve annotated the ridge with a yellow line.  This is Tuesday \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Thursday, a cold upper-level trough is dropping down the back side of the ridge as it backs off to the west. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut it appears just about all moisture will remain offshore, so we\u2019re going with just a few light showers (rain) Thursday evening.  Weather geeks will remember that THIS was going to be the big system that would drop south and bring in arctic air at the end of the week.  That was on some models maybe 5-7 days ago.  Now it\u2019s just a weak ripple in the northwesterly flow.  Then by Monday the 25th, a much deeper & colder trough is moving into the Pacific Northwest \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis one is preceded by a stronger cold front and plenty of moisture next Sunday.  Depending on the exact track of surface low pressure, this setup CAN bring snow to sea level.  I\u2019ve got two thoughts on that.  First, neither the GFS or ECMWF models at this moment retain enough cold offshore flow to bring widespread sticking snow to the valley floor.  That\u2019s because the low is coming in from the northwest.  Second, the air isn\u2019t that cold to begin with and we\u2019re quickly going to onshore (mild) flow.  That\u2019s almost always a snow killer.  That system next Sunday reminds me of several during the 2007-2008 winter that brought abundant snow to Detroit, the Gorge, Coast Range, and the Cascade foothills.  But not quite cold enough for lowest elevations to get in on the snow action.  850mb temperatures are forecast to be around -5 to -6\u2026again, not quite cold enough for a big snow event in the metro area next Sunday.  I think the ECMWF rain/snow forecast shows the situation well for Sunday night \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBeyond that, the upper-ridging wants to move even farther west of us, allowing a cold trough to set up over the Gulf of Alaska and send cold waves of moisture our way.  A quick animation of those upper-level heights from next Monday the 25th to Monday February 1st (a full week), shows the progression westward, along with the coldest air \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe final image tells me a lot.   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt says that beyond about day 10, we\u2019re into a classic La Nina pattern that\u2019s wet and cool.  Tons of mountain snow, but not much chance for it in the lowlands.  This will likely be the first big week of mountain snow this winter, maybe like the middle of last January? \n\n\n\nCheck out the ECMWF ensemble forecasts for snow.  About 1/3 to 1/2 produce \u201csleddable\u201d snow in the Portland metro area sometime in the next 2 weeks.  I think that might be generous considering what I\u2019m seeing right now. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can see model forecasts of high temperature (usually a few degrees low) dip to a minimum early NEXT week and then rise again as we get more systems off the mild Pacific.  This is the GFS. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOne more thing that gives me confidence that we\u2019re not headed into a major cold/snowy spell\u2026the 850mb ensemble charts.  Excellent agreement through the next 7-9 days, then a rise (warming).  Almost no members below -7 through the next two weeks.  This is just the ECMWF, but GFS is similar. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis wasn\u2019t the case 5-7 days ago.  As we get closer to a change, models come together most of the time and this is a good example. \n\n\n\nThat\u2019s it for now.  Of course even without a \u201cmajor cold/snowy spell\u201d, we can get an event where part of the lowlands get snow and that may not show up until just a few days ahead of time.  I\u2019ll be working regular shifts for the next 3-4 weeks as we wrap up this \u201cwinter\u201d.   We should still be having some fun even if no widespread snowstorm shows up in the valleys.   \n\n\n\nMake sure you follow me on Facebook  @marknelsenweather, Twitter: @marknelsenKPTV, I update those far more often than this blog.

                "text": "The storm that brought all the rain, wind and snow Saturday, is still impacting New England this afternoon. The storm center has stalled in southeastern Canada and is causing heavy snow at our mountains once again, but a good amount of sunshine toward the coast with windy conditions. \n\n\n\nTemperatures Sunday are not too cold for this time of year though, in the 30s north and low 40s south. We have a nice crescent moon in the evening sky with temperatures only slowly falling into the 30s south and 20s north for lows. \n\n\n\nOur Martin Luther King Jr. Day looks similar to today, with plenty of sunshine toward the coast, and mountain snow showers continuing. A little less windy, and a tad less cold with high temperatures in the 30s north, and in the low 40s south. A cold front may generate a snow shower all the way to southern New England later tomorrow, then colder air comes in for the rest of the 10-day forecast. \n\n\n\nTuesday looks bright with plenty of sunshine for most, high temperatures in the 20s to low 30s. A sharp cold front comes in Tuesday night with a few snow showers or a snow squall, leading to a windy and cold Wednesday with temperatures in the teens north and 20s south. Another front like that comes through Thursday night with a chance of some more snow showers and sets up a pretty cold looking \u2014 but mostly storm free \u2014 weekend.  \n\n\n\nThe next significant storm threat may be near the end of our First Alert 10-day forecast, a week from Tuesday.",

Today there are thousands of ways to earn extra money doing odds and ends to save money fast. Some tasks can even be done on your phone in a matter of minutes, while others take more time (more like a job but not a real job).           We'll show you how to make money without a job below \u2013 and maybe even have a little fun too. You'll find that you don't need high income skills to fill your pockets.           How To Make Money Without A Job           1. Earn Cash Back For Normal Spending           Do you earn credit card rewards just for spending? It's great right? You get paid to buy things. Now you can take it a step further with some of the highest paying apps that pay you to shop.           Rakuten and Ibotta, for example, pay users cash back for purchases made at their partner stores. You shop in the app at the stores you'd normally shop and earn money back. Ibotta is also a grocery store reward app, providing cashback on specific grocery store purchases after you upload your receipt.             If you want promo codes and cashback, check out Honey. 'Standard' Honey finds promo codes for you automatically when you shop online if you install the browser extension. Honey Gold, combines the promo codes with cashback rewards. You earn 'gold' which you can turn into gift cards once you have 1,000 coins ($10).             2. Share Your Opinion Online           Companies pay consumers for their opinion. It helps them create better products and services and learn what others think about what they offer. Today there are thousands of paid online surveys all vying for your opinion.           Taking online surveys is a great way to earn a little cash on the side. We love Swagbucks and MyPoints for their survey opportunities and other bonus opportunities, such as playing games or watching videos.                   But definitely keep a look out for Pinecone Research invites too. This exclusive survey company only invites new survey takers periodically, so jump on the opportunity when you see it because they are one of the highest paying survey companies out there.           3. Play Games On Your Phone           Do you love to play games on your phone? Why not get paid for it? Several survey sites like Swagbucks and MyPoints offer the chance to earn money playing games.           If you have an Android phone, you can download Mistplay and earn money too. At Mistplay, you choose the games, and earn as you play. The more you play, the more money you earn.             If your child is looking for ways to make money as a teen, this may be an easy online job for them if they're already on their phone a good portion of the day. Honestly, though, playing games for all ages is one of our favorite ways to make money on our list of how to make money without a job.           4. Get Healthy and Start Walking           Walking makes you healthy and now it can earn you money too. Some apps pay you to walk \u2013 talk about incentive! Whether you want to get paid for the steps you take or the weight you lose, there are apps out there that motivate you to keep going by paying you for your efforts.           One app in particular, HealthyWage, has been piquing interests everywhere. HealthyWage pays you to lose weight, but only if you 'bet on yourself.' Rather than wasting money paying for a gym membership you'll never use, bet yourself that you'll lose weight. What better carrot to dangle in front of your face than cash earnings, right?             5. Start A Blog or YouTube Channel           Have you ever considered investing in some digital real estate to make money? Blogging or 'vlogging' requires some work, but we're willing to bet it's a lot more fun than sitting at your desk from 9 to 5.           Start a blog or video channel on YouTube about something you love. It could be something professional or completely personal. Find your niche audience and market it. Before you know it, you can make money blogging.           It's simple.           Use advertisements whether affiliate marketing (you get your own links and when people buy off your link you earn commission) or sponsorships. You'd be surprised to learn how many companies pay bloggers and YouTubers to talk about their product. Now's your time to shine and start making money online.             6. Invest in Real Estate                   YieldStreet connects accredited investors (with at least $5,000 to invest) with alternative investments including litigation finance, real estate, and commercial finance.           7. Squirrel Away Extra Change           Did you ever think about investing your spare change? Us either \u2013 it sounds crazy that you can save for a home, college, or any other financial goal with spare change, but Acorns makes it possible.             Link your debit or credit card to the Acorns app and they round up each purchase to the nearest dollar, sweeping the change into your Acorns account. Once you have $5 accumulated, they invest it. Now there's no excuse to not invest!           8. Rent Out Your Stuff           Do you have stuff lying around that no one uses? Rent it out and make money!           You can rent anything out today. You've likely heard of Airbnb where you can rent out your home or space in your home. There are apps to rent out your car, like Getaround, and even sites where you can find parents that want to rent baby gear like strollers and carseats.             Look around your house \u2013 chances are if you have things you don't use, there's someone that will and will pay you for it.           9. Walk Dogs           Introverts rejoice \u2013 you can get paid to spend time with furry friends. Why not get exercise, have fun with dogs and make money?           Rover Sitters matches pet owners with pet walkers. Think of it like the Uber of pet walking. Once matched, you set up your schedule with the pet owner and get paid to have a little fun with dogs.           Dog walkers make an average of $15 an hour, but you set your rates and your schedule. You may even walk multiple dogs at once (with owner approval) and make money fast.               10. Open an Etsy Shop           Are you crafty? Maybe you make digital goods. Etsy offers a great platform for people like you to start your own side hustle.           You set up your shop using the Etsy platform and market to Etsy's audience of millions, making sales doing what you love.           Etsy charges low rates and makes it easy for anyone to start a shop and begin earning money fast.             11. Deliver Food and Get Paid to Drive           Do you love to drive? Why not get paid to do it? You've likely heard of the most common rideshare services \u2013 Uber and Lyft. You download the app and pick up 'shifts' as you want.           You work your own hours. This is the best way to make sure it's convenient for you. Uber and Lyft set the rates and pay peak pay during busy times.           If you'd rather deliver than drive people (perfect for introvert jobs), there are so many services you can sign up for today. Shipt and Instacart are grocery store services. They both offer the option to deliver groceries to customers' homes or you can shop in store, delivering the groceries curbside.             If grocery shopping isn't your thing, consider delivering restaurant food with Ubereats or Doordash or being an Amazon driver on your own time and with your own vehicle with Amazon Flex.           12. Take Advantage of Free Stuff           A quick search online will turn up all the ways to get free stuff. Companies give away free stuff all the time. Follow your favorite companies on social media and you'll see what we mean.           You can even find free stuff in your groups \u2013 local groups on Facebook often have people giving away furniture and clothing they no longer need. You can sign up for free books by mail and you can even earn free PayPal money by doing little odds and ends like shopping online, watching videos, or answering surveys.           13. Create a Course, Product or Book           Are you incredibly knowledgeable or passionate about a topic? Why not share your knowledge with the world? In today's digital world, people pay for courses and books like crazy and the internet makes it simple to start.           Udemy and Teachable are two popular sites to create courses, and Amazon self-publishing is crazy easy. Anyone can be an author today! If writing a book has always been on your bucket list, make it a reality and show everyone how to make money without a job.           If you'd rather not teach, but you have a product you can make and sell \u2013 go for it. There are so many sites that make it easy including eBay, Amazon, and Etsy. You don't even have to start your own website if you don't want the hassle or expense.             14. Dropship with Shopify or Sell on Amazon FBA           If owning a store with inventory seems too overwhelming, but you love marketing and want to make money selling to people worldwide, consider dropshipping.           Shopify has a great platform for dropshippers, making it easy to set up your storefront and create a flow of communication between you, the customer, and the dropshipper.           If you want to sell your own products rather than someone else's, consider Amazon FBA. You send your products to Amazon and they handle the order processing, shipping, and packaging.           All you do is the marketing and of course, creating the products, but you take the administrative headaches off your shoulders.           15. Babysit or House-sit           If you love kids or love empty houses, consider babysitting or house sitting. It takes a village to live life the way we need to. Everyone is busy and needs help watching their prized possessions whether it's the children of the house. Set your rates, and market your services in your area and watch the requests fly in. You may even find this is a way to make $1000 a month.           16. Garage Sale           Do you have stuff lying around the house you haven't touched in months or years? Your trash could be someone else's treasure.           Set up a shop in your garage and price everything to sell. Advertise your garage sale in your local Facebook groups, Craigslist, and with signs out in the area. You'll find people seeking you out as some people make a living shopping garage sales.           If you'd rather not have people at your house, you could even sell stuff online on sites like Facebook Marketplace for the same results.           17. Flip Stuff from Flea Markets           If you have an eye for a good deal, consider buying items and selling them for more at flea markets. Whether you grab a good clearance deal, you shop garage sales, or you watch Craigslist for deals, becoming a flea market flipper means you can make money having fun selling what other people don't want.           18. Watch Ads or Movies for Money           If you don't mind looking at your phone for a while, consider making money watching ads or movies.           Sites like InboxDollars, Swagbucks, and MyPoints pay viewers to check their email and watch ads or movies. Basically, they are paying for advertising, hoping that their product or service sticks in your mind, and you either spread the word or make a purchase.             You won't get rich doing this, but a little extra cash never hurt anyone.           19. Private Tutoring           In today's interesting school environment more parents want help outside of school. If you specialize in a particular subject, you'll make even more money.           For example, did you ace the SAT or ACT? High school students are always looking for tutors to help them prepare for this important yet stressful test.           If you prefer tutoring elementary aged students, kids learning English as a second language, or you like a specific subject, such as math, advertise your services in your area. Many libraries also keep a database of tutors in the area.           If you want to tutor online, consider a site like VIPKid where you teach Chinese students English, or Tutor.com where you are matched with students in the US who need help with subjects such as chemistry, physics, calculus, or English.           20. Mow Lawns or Remove Snow           If you're outdoorsy, consider checking out an odd jobs app to see if anyone in your area needs their lawn moved or snow removed. Homeowners are busy and often don't have time or don't want to be bothered with these cumbersome tasks. They may not go out of their way to find a service, but if a flyer comes their way, they may just hire you.           21. Rent Out A Room on Airbnb           Do you have a room in your home you don't use? Whether it's a finished basement apartment or a bedroom in your home, rent it out on Airbnb.           You choose \u2013 you can rent out the room while you are home or you can rent out your home and go stay with a friend or family member while you make money letting someone else use your home.           22. Become a Transcriber           If you have an ear for detail and can type fast, consider becoming a transcriber. You convert audio to grammatically correct typed content. You can transcribe for a variety of industries including the medical and legal communities. Beginning transcribers earn around $15 an hour to start but work their way up to around $30 an hour with experience.           23. Market Your Freelance or Business Services           If you have a skill \u2013 market it. There are many platforms including Fiverr and Upwork that make the marketing easy. You set up your gigs and prices and the platforms advertise for you. In exchange, you pay them a portion of your earnings.           Some of the most popular freelance services today include:             24. Test Drive Cars           Many car manufacturers pay you to test drive their vehicles. Visit the car manufacturer's website that you want to drive and get on their mailing list.           When they have test drive opportunities, you'll receive an email. Head to your local dealer, drive the car, and get a certificate from the dealer stating that you drove the vehicle and you'll get paid. You're bound to have fun because these opportunities surely aren't for beater cars.           25. Beta Test or Review Software and Apps           Software and app developers want to know what users think before they release their products to the public. Sign up to be a beta tester and you can have a say in how new software and apps operate.           You use the software and app as directed and the company pays you for your opinion. You may have to fill out paperwork about your experience and/or talk about it with a panel to discuss your experience, likes/dislikes about the products.           26. Mystery Shop           If you love shopping, consider doing a mystery shop. This works with both stores and restaurants. Companies hire you to go into the store and buy a specific item, noting the cleanliness of the store, friendliness of the employees, help you received, and the checkout process.           If you become a mystery shopper for a restaurant, you visit the restaurant, noting the cleanliness, service, and even the state of the bathrooms. You must note the speed of service, how long your food takes, and the quality of the food.           You'll provide a review of your experience either written or spoken and get paid for your time in addition to reimbursement for your product or meal purchased. You may not earn a full time income, it might feel like you're only finding quarters, but I wouldn't pass up a free meal.           27. Focus Groups           Companies put focus groups together to learn about your experience with their products or services. Basically companies pay to ask specific questions about products or services they already have out as well as opinions about upcoming products and services. Focus groups usually take about one to two hours and pay you $100 or more for your time.           28. Mock Trials           Mock trials are a twist on focus groups. Rather than reviewing products or services, you act like a juror and lawyers give their arguments to see how you'd vote.           You can earn $20 to $50 per case, and you just sit and listen to the arguments and give your thoughts. You get the thrill of jury duty without sitting through an actual trial. It helps lawyers out and you make extra money.           29. Officiate Weddings           We all loved it when Joey in Friends officiated Monica and Chandler's wedding and now you can be just like Joey! It's free to get officiated, but you may have to pay for a certificate from your county proving your ability to officiate weddings. You can make $500 and up per wedding, so it's a lucrative way to make side cash.           30. Become a Voiceover Artist           If you love making funny voices, make money doing it as a voiceover artist. Before you'd have to wait to be 'discovered' but with the internet, it's easier than ever to get paid to do this.           Whether you do voiceovers for podcasts, commercials, or even television shows, there are many opportunities. You can work for yourself, advertising your gig on sites like Fiverr or you can work for an actual company.             31. Be Someone's Friend           Are you someone that everyone loves to be around? Money can't buy happiness, but you could get paid for your skill as a friend. Services hire people like you to attend parties, concerts, or just visit with them. Rent a Friend is one of the popular sites offering this service, but there are others too.           You'll make a profile, showcasing your talents, personality, and other factors that might make others want to choose you. Once chosen (this isn't a dating service), you'll spend time with the person that chose you, providing friendship and making extra money doing it.           32. Get Paid to Cook           You've heard of ridesharing, now there's foodsharing. People hire you to come cook for them. This is the perfect gig for amateur chefs. Join sites like Cozymeal and EatWith are two popular platforms that match chefs with diners, helping you earn extra money doing what you love.           You can cook and host in your home or travel to other homes, cooking for them. There are even sites of the cheapest meal delivery services where you cook the meal and deliver it to the buyers, but aren't on site while they eat.           A \"Real Job\" Isn't the Only Way to Make Money           The term 'real' job gets lost in translation these days with everyone working from home. Many people don't work the traditional 9 to 5 desk job anymore and getting a real job is becoming more scarce.           Most people work a variety of jobs whether gigs, side jobs, or even tasks they work to bring in extra cash. The most important thing is that everyone is having fun and showing the world how to make money without a job.           What do you plan on doing with the money you earn? We suggest checking out the FIRE Movement and the Dave Ramsey Baby Steps for ideas on how to make the best decision. You can choose to invest your money in something like VTSAX vs VTI.

And I have a suggestion for those New Year's resolutions you've probably already made: Don't make any!   Instead, focus on making New Year's commitments. First and foremost, a commitment to start some new investments, and change direction on some others.     getty   2020 was a volatile year in both the economy and the financial markets. 2021 could prove to be more of the same. While you might not make any radical investment changes in the new year, the flipping of the calendar is a good time to make adjustments in your current portfolio, and even to take on some new challenges that may not seem like investments in the traditional sense. But trust me, they are.   Here is my list of the seven best investments to make in 2021:   1. \u00a0Build Your Cash Reserves  Stocks are still the way to go in 2021. But don't expect the market to give a repeat performance of 2020. Sure, the S&P 500 index was up more than 14% by Christmas. And that comes on the heels of a 29% gain in 2019. But both numbers are well above the historical average annual return of about 10% per year.     That doesn't necessarily mean the market will take a dive in 2021. But it may be time for an adjustment in expectations.   Since there is no true way to counterbalance losses in stocks with other assets, cash is the default choice.   Not only does it maintain its value even when the financial markets are in turmoil, but also provides the capital to buy up stocks at what may prove to be bargain prices. You may want to do that after a downturn in the general market, or to take advantage of investing in specific market sectors.       MORE FOR YOU         It's true that it's hard to earn a decent return on interest-bearing investments, like certificates of deposit or U.S. Treasury securities. But there are some banks that are paying interest rates at the higher end of the scale. No, you won't grow your money. But cash serves a much more important purpose in this kind of investment environment: it provides liquidity.   With stocks ending 2020 in record territory, the best investment strategy may prove to be building up cash reserves. It won't provide big returns, but will leave you better prepared for whatever will be coming next.   2. \u00a0Stocks \u2013 Still the Way to Go in 2021  No one can say for certain which way the stock market will head in 2021, but investing in stocks has always been about playing the averages. And the averages strongly favor maintaining a large position in stocks.   That said, you may want to become more selective. The major indices, like the S&P 500 and the NASDAQ 100 have largely powered forward on the strength of tech stocks. If that sector begins to head south, it can drag the major indices down with it.   This is another reason to build your cash reserves. If you're heavily invested in the S&P 500, a large cash position will give you an opportunity to invest in emerging sectors if the general market declines.   Moving beyond Tech Stocks and the S&P 500  I'm certainly not calling that shift in 2021. But at the same time, tech stocks have a convincing track record of steady, spectacular gains over several years, reliably followed by equally impressive declines. 2021 may prove to be a year when investors will be scrambling for other sectors to favor.   Fortunately, there are plenty of options.   \"Defense stocks under-performed in 2020 but have a 30+ year track record of new highs within 30 months,\" advises Scott Sacknoff, CEO of SerenityShares. \"A rebound in commercial aerospace and solid defense spending in 2021 is expected. I Expect ETFs like the Invesco Defense ETF (NYSE: PPA) to outperform the market.\"   Given the potential for both economic growth and rising inflation in the coming year, certain commodity sectors may become investment-worthy.   \"Certain commodities such as industrial metals and agricultural products appear to have a good reward-risk tradeoff in 2021,\" notes Forbes Senior Contributor, Rob Isbitts. \"That implies inflation pressure, as the global economy kicks back into gear and input prices rise. I also see 2021 as a crucial year for pre-retirees, after 2020's 'warning shot'. Those approaching retirement need to take account for how much they have accumulated and make it an absolute priority NOT to give a lot of that back to this inanimate object called 'the stock market'.\"   Still another stock sector to consider is biotech, which represents the cutting edge of the healthcare industry. With the effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines still in the \"too early to tell\" stage, biotech may continue to be a strong sector in 2021 no matter what the general market is doing.   A simple way to play the sector is through the SPDR S&P Biotech ETF (XBI) XBI . The fund was up an incredible 40% through November 30, and about 30% for 2019.   3. Real Estate  Given the steady rise in residential real estate prices, as well as turbulence in the commercial real estate market, the sector does look like a mixed bag going into 2021. But that's exactly why it may deserve a close look in the coming year.   I'm a big fan of real estate investment trusts (REITs), though the sector as a whole did poorly in 2020. Based on the FTSE Nareit U.S. Real Estate Index REITs have shed 7.25% through December 24. But that comes on the heels of a 28% gain in 2019.   Which way will real estate go in 2021? It's anyone's guess.   REITs looked like a solid bet after both big gains in 2019 and a strong start with the economy in 2020. But no one saw the coronavirus coming at that time, and it proved to be a game-changer.   Commercial real estate has been negatively impacted by a massive move toward remote basing of employees. Office buildings and many big-city downtown areas have seen sharp spikes in vacancy rates, while retail space has been hurt by the closure of tens of thousands of stores.   But the misfortunes of one year often create new investment opportunities in the next.   \"The real estate market on both the commercial and residential side will more than likely fall off a proverbial cliff as forbearance programs come to an end and stimulus funding runs out in early to mid-2021,\" warns Marc Snyderman, COO and co-founder of the Apolline Group, LLC. \"For those with cash on hand and unleveraged balance sheets, there will be significant opportunities to buy up distressed and foreclosed properties.\"   Still another reason to consider investing in real estate is as a counter-play to the stock market. Real estate often turns in a strong performance during stock market declines, as investors look for alternative equity investments. Since real estate returns have been comparable to the stock market over the past several decades, real estate serves as a natural alternative to stocks in the equity space.   4. Pay down or Pay Off Debt  Whether the economy turns up or tumbles down in 2021, the experience of 2020, should serve as a cautionary tale. Millions of workers lost their jobs, tens of thousands of people lost their businesses, and the stock market staged an impressive recovery after it's late winter mini-crash.   The point is, life is unpredictable. At the beginning of 2020, the stock market was at record highs, housing prices were rising, and unemployment was at record lows. The general assumption at the beginning of the year was smooth sailing ahead.   If 2021 plays out to be as unpredictable as 2020 has been \u2013 and there's even a possibility it will be more so \u2013 paying down or paying off debt will be one of the very best investments you can make. You can ill-afford to carry credit cards with 20% interest rates or even a low-interest home equity line of credit if your job or business reaches jeopardy status in 2021.   In addition, paying off a credit card with a 20% interest rate will be like locking in a 20% investment return for several years.   The paying off or paying down debt isn't all about preparing for the worst either. It's equally a matter of preparing for the best.   If you want to make any of the investments in this article, increase your retirement savings, or launch a side business, the less money you owe the easier each of those ventures will be.   Much like building up cash reserves, getting out of debt is a way of increasing your preparedness. That will work to your advantage whether you're preparing for an oncoming storm or jumping into a new venture that will improve your future.   5. Launch or Accelerate Your Retirement Savings Plan  Technically speaking, a retirement plan isn't an investment \u2013 at least not in-and-of itself. It would be better to say that it's a platform to do your investing in.   You should take full advantage of that. Not only are contributions generally tax-deductible, but the investment income you earn in your account is tax-deferred. That can mean the difference between getting a 7% return on your investments \u2013 after tax \u2013 and 10%, tax-deferred.   The compounding difference between the two over 20 or 30 years is staggering.   For example, let's say you can invest in stocks and REITs and earn an average annual return of 10%. If your combined federal and state income tax rate is 30%, the net return on your investments in a taxable account will be 7%.   If you invest $10,000 in a taxable account for 20 years, with an average annual after-tax rate of return of 7%, the account will grow to about $38,700.   But if the same $10,000 is invested in a tax-sheltered retirement plan, you'll get the benefit of the full 10% average annual rate of return on your investments. After 20 years, your initial investment will grow to about $67,300. That means you'll be nearly $30,000 richer just for housing your investments in the right account.   That's what investing through a tax-sheltered retirement plan can do for your investments. And we haven't even calculated the benefit of employer matching contributions on 401(k) and 403(b) plans.   Given that advantage, you should have all the motivation you need to either start a retirement plan or increase your contributions to the one you have in the coming year.   If you're participating in an employer-sponsored retirement plan, you can contribute up to 100% of your earned income, up to $19,500 per year, or $26,000 if you're 50 or older.   Make a commitment to get as close to the maximum contribution as you can in 2021. And if you haven't started a retirement plan so far, make it happen in the coming year.   6. Make 2021 the Year You Begin Investing in Yourself  This is one of my favorite \"investments\", even though most people probably don't think of it that way. But investing in yourself is often the best long-term move you can make. It offers an opportunity to increase your earning power, which will have a major, positive impact on any other investment activity you participate in.   That may be more important to do in 2021 than it has been in decades. 2020 proved to be a difficult year for people in at least a dozen different occupations. Investing in yourself may be a way to add an important skill that will enable you to either keep the job you have or transition into another field.   \"In my mind, the best investment is in yourself,\" advises Tom Diem, CFP and ChFC at Diem Wealth Management. \"2020 has been a struggle for many just to keep employed. Overcoming unemployment doesn't have to involve entering into an extensive educational program. It's better to think a little differently. Sure, the food and beverage, tourism, fitness, and health and beauty sectors have taken a hard hit this year. But despite lockdowns, the home improvement industry has shown gains in 2020. According to Macrotrends, Lowe's Corporation has a year-to-date increase in sales of over 1% and a third quarter sales increase of over 28%. It may be a matter of shifting out of the occupations that are in decline and into those that are on the rise.\"   Investing in yourself doesn't necessarily have to be limited to improving your career prospects. You can also invest in other areas of your life, like improving your health, or learning how to be a better investor. Either will have the potential to improve your long-term financial situation, as well as the quality of your life.   \"Most people go from month to month, year to year, only seeing \"what happens\" or \"how things go\" or \"how the market performs\" - but never invest the time, effort and financial resources to improve themselves,\" suggests Frank Lopes, author of The 7-Minute Setup: How to Achieve your Business and Personal Goals Faster and Easier. \"Some examples of this could be investing in a personal trainer to get themselves into shape. Or the investment of a nutritionist to set up meal plans, shopping lists, and menus to follow so someone can invest in their nutrition and better health. You can also hire a personal coach to set up a process for achieving other financial, spiritual, time management, relationship, and other short- and long-term goals.\"   7. Invest in a Side Business  Much like investing in yourself, a side business isn't typically thought of as an investment. But it is very much an investment, even though time and effort may be your actual investment, rather than money. And in a very real way, investing in a side business is the ultimate form of investing in yourself.   I'm personally a big fan of side hustles. That's mostly because my current income portfolio includes a number of side hustles that have become regular contributors to my bottom line. Because of my experience, I'm keenly aware there are literally dozens of ways an ordinary person can make money for a side hustle.   It's not as complicated as you may think, either. Most side businesses start with either a hobby or by converting what you do on your primary job to a second income source.   Examples include:   1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0If you're a teacher, you can provide specialized tutoring on the side.   2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0If you're bilingual, you can teach English as a second language.   3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As an accountant by day, you can build a side business providing income tax preparation to individuals, or bookkeeping services to small businesses.   4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0If you have a strong social media presence, you may be able to parlay that into becoming a social media manager for multiple small businesses.   5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0If there's a topic you're particularly strong in \u2013 like investing, auto mechanics, or traveling on a budget \u2013 you can create an e-book and sell it on the web.   These are just five examples of the types of side businesses you can start from right where you are now.   \"I have a lifestyle business in which I travel the world and generate revenue in several ways,\" reports Tina Dahmen, online course coach at Entrepreneur.com and owner of her own online course creation blog, TinaDahmen.com. \u00a0\"One of the ways is online courses. What I found with online courses, and selling them in particular, is that blogging helps to build authority in the space and it's a necessity to be seen as an expert if you sell online courses. Online courses are a digital asset which anyone can create.\"   I can't say enough about the benefits of a side business. The most obvious is the ability to earn additional money that can be used to either pay off debt, or increase savings and investments. But a longer-term possibility \u2013 and one that happens more than you might think \u2013 is that your side business may one day turn into your primary occupation. If it's work you truly enjoy, it'll be a double win.   If you take the plunge into a side business, you'll have plenty of company. According to the IRS, there are at least 41 million self-employed people in the US, most of whom run their businesses as side hustles. You can be one of them.   Bottom Line  As we enter 2021, it should be obvious to everyone that change is a normal part of life. And though it doesn't always, it sometimes affects your financial well-being. That can include your job, your business, and your investment portfolio.   Since panicking solves absolutely nothing, the best strategy is to have a plan of attack. That may not mean doing anything radical. But just implementing strategies that will increase your investment returns, decrease your losses, improve your ability to earn a living (or stay employed), and get better control over your cash flow, can lead to major improvements in your life going forward.   So, forget about those New Year's resolutions, and zero-in on New Year's commitments \u2013 making the kinds of investments that will improve both your finances and the quality of your life.

                "text": "Evidently the melting of the snow over the last couple days exposed enough fallen birdseed that it brought a bunch of birds back.\u00a0 First, a pair of Juncos pecked around, then a pair of Sparrows came to the feeder, the House Finches landed on the platform feeder, a Chickadee swooped in for a seed, and a flock of Mourning Doves landed on the ground under the feeders.\u00a0 It was so dim that they're hard to see but there are about eight Doves in this picture, maybe more.      While the Doves were there, a female Downy Woodpecker came to the suet for a snack.    I added a few rounds to the January Cast Sock #2 but couldn't muster up much gumption to knit today. 17 January--Barbara Malcolm, The Seaview.\u00a0           Normal  0          false  false  false    EN-US  X-NONE  X-NONE                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          It was getting close to six in the evening and time to close the dive shop when I walked down the beach to my hotel.\u00a0 From the sea side it looked much better.\u00a0 Luke and Stanley had finished priming the front and, while it was a bit blotchy, I could see a hint of how it would look when it was finished.\u00a0 Maybe I could get the shutters painted over the weekend so that as soon as the final coat of paint was applied they could be mounted.\u00a0 They were real working shutters too, not just decorative ones.\u00a0 They had nice sturdy latches to hold them closed if a big storm came onshore.\u00a0 I climbed the steps of the front porch and pride swelled as I saw what we had accomplished in a little over two months.\u00a0 There was no music cascading down from the roof which meant that Luke and Stanley had finished up for the day.\u00a0 I had seen Silas and Edward walking down to Johnno\u2019s when I left the dive shop, so their hammers and saws were quiet.\u00a0 No rusty old pipes clattered down the trash slide into Mr. Carty\u2019s faithful dumpster that still crouched under it in back, so the plumbers were gone too.\u00a0   \u201cHello?\u201d I called and I heard Iggy say, \u201cBack here\u201d from the kitchen.\u00a0   When I went down the short hall and through the door I was amazed at what I saw.\u00a0 \u201cOh my god,\u201d I stopped dead one step over the threshold, \u201cI have a kitchen.\u00a0 A real kitchen.\u201d\u00a0   While I had been away a miracle had occurred.\u00a0 The stove was installed and the sink and countertop were too.\u00a0 Along one wall there were bottom cupboards, with doors that had pierced metal inserts, topped by a quartz countertop.\u00a0 Above it were open shelves made of wire for air circulation.\u00a0 It was everything I had imagined all those months ago when I was spending so much time and money in home improvement stores.\u00a0   Iggy smiled at me from the top of the stepladder where he was attaching the last blade of the big ceiling fan.\u00a0 \u201cHow do you like it?\u00a0 I made everyone help so that I could surprise you.\u201d\u00a0   I covered my mouth with my fingers.\u00a0 \u201cIt\u2026 it is just wonderful.\u201d\u00a0   He climbed down and I walked to him and put my arms around his neck.\u00a0 \u201cThank you, Iggy, thank you so much.\u201d\u00a0 I rose up on my tiptoes and kissed him.\u00a0   His arms went around me and pulled me close.\u00a0 Our kiss deepened and the stresses of the week faded.\u00a0 I ran my right hand down his back and cupped his butt.\u00a0 I loved his firm bottom, the way it felt it my hand.\u00a0   His hand strayed from my jaw to my left breast and we ground together, each of us murmuring our pleasure.\u00a0 It crossed my mind that we might just make love right there.\u00a0   \u201cMother!\u201d\u00a0 A shocked male voice blared through the room.    Today's toss was another old phone, this one a cordless with two charging stations.\u00a0 I'm sure no one will want them but you never know. Writing went okay today.\u00a0 The prompt wondered how you would cope with no tech.\u00a0 I decided that I can't be without it, especially during the pandemic.\u00a0 I don't have a landline anymore and if I couldn't zoom with knitting friends or text people, I'd go mad.\u00a0 Or madder than I already am.\u00a0 Anyway, I managed to fill the page with my ramblings. --Barbara",

You had only to look at Bolton to know that he had more\u00a0cruelty\u00a0in his pinky toe than all the\u00a0Freys\u00a0combined. - Reek III, aDwD I believe quotes like these refer to the effect of the cruelty they enact, rather than the specific crimes.  Ramsay is vile and cruel, enacting heinous violence upon people like a slasher movie villain. We do not have any evidence that Roose personally inflicts the same degree of crass violence upon people, as even in his presumably candid retelling of the miller\u2019s wife story, while a horrifying and inexcusable crime, he does not reach the extreme level of violence Ramsay inflicts upon smallfolk on the regular with his hunts and torturings.  \u201cRoose\u00a0Bolton\u2019s cold and cunning, aye, but a\u00a0man\u00a0can\u00a0deal\u00a0with\u00a0Roose. We\u2019ve all known worse. But this bastard son of his \u2026 they say he\u2019s mad and cruel, a monster.\u201d - Davos III, aDwD The point, i believe, is not who produces the worst feats of violence, but rather another facette of grrms criticism of feudalism:  Would Ramsay even have a chance to do these heinous crimes if his father, who knows about everything, had an ounce of morality in him?  [Roose:] \u201cAll\u00a0you\u00a0have I gave\u00a0you. You\u00a0would\u00a0do\u00a0well\u00a0to\u00a0remember\u00a0that,\u00a0bastard.\u201d - Reek III, aDwD Everything Ramsay has, his high position, the freedom to do all the crimes he wants, the protection from law that would have otherwise sent him to the wall in no time, he has because of his father\u2019s selfishness. Roose could have stopped these crimes from happening, he could have given Ramsay the appropriate punishment, instead he keeps Ramsay around because he feels like it\u2026  Roose is at the top of his society, answering to barely anyone except his overlord and his king; so much power is at his fingertips, and yet he uses it for selfish reasons, commits crimes, allows crimes to happen in full knowledge, and everything is handled as it benefits him instead of abiding to morality or law. Every crime Ramsay does is Roose\u2019 responsibility as feudal lord and thus his crime.  \u201cWhen soldiers lack discipline, the\u00a0fault\u00a0lies\u00a0with their lord commander,\u201d his father said. - Tyrion VIII, aGoT Roose is called the leech lord, and indeed he is a leech upon society, bleeding his people dry to his own benefit while not lifting a finger himself. While he is not a literal vampire, obviously parts of his character are a play on vampire myths, and the aristocratic bloodsucking vampire is frequently used as a metaphor for critique of the ruling class (i hear Fever Dream by grrm plays with this, though i have not read it). He might not commit a Texas Chainsaw Massacre in person, but that doesn\u2019t make him any less morally bankrupt and despicable, and he still has the same blood on his hands.    There is a tendency where Roose tries to lighten his crimes in conversation - here are three examples showing different facettes:  \u201cThe arrogance of it! They do not expect the north to believe their\u00a0lies, not truly, but they think we must pretend to believe or die. Roose\u00a0Bolton\u00a0lies\u00a0about his part in the Red Wedding, and his bastard\u00a0lies\u00a0about the fall of Winterfell.\u201d\u00a0- Davos IV, aDwD [Roose:] \u201cTell me, my lord \u2026 if the\u00a0kinslayer\u00a0is\u00a0accursed, what is a father to do when one son slays another?\u201d - Reek III, aDwD[Roose:] \u201cThe maesters will tell you that King Jaehaerys abolished the lord\u2019s right to the first night to appease his shrewish queen, but where the old gods rule, old customs linger. The Umbers keep the first night too, deny it as they may.\u00a0Certain\u00a0of the\u00a0mountain\u00a0clans\u00a0as\u00a0well, and on Skagos \u2026\u00a0well, only heart trees ever see half of what they do on Skagos.\u201d - Reek III, aDwD  1. Denial of involvement - Roose frequently either escapes blame completely (for example for Duskendale), puts blame on someone else (like blaming Ramsay\u2019s bastard blood for Winterfell), or lies about his crimes to evade blame.  2. Selectively invoking law - using the kinslaying law, he pretends his hands are tied when it comes to Ramsay, even though he could for example also send him to the wall as punishment. He frequently breaks laws as he pleases and also took part in breaking sacred contracts such as guest right (red wedding), so him invoking law in this instance is likely a tool to absolve himself of blame during the conversation.  3. Comparing himself to others to lessen his own acts, after failing to escape blame - by bringing the Umbers etc into the conversation, he tries to make himself look less bad; \u201clook, everyone\u2019s doing it, and the skagosi are probably even worse than me!\u201d    As opposed to Ramsay, he is aware of how the severity of the crimes he is doing would be received by others. He likes to present himself as a rational and civilized man, and thus has an interest to downplay his criminal actions, even if he does not see anything wrong with them as he did them for his own benefit.  \u201cNo tales were ever told of me. Do you think I would be\u00a0sitting\u00a0here if it were\u00a0otherwise?\u201d - Reek III, aDwD \u201cThat annoyed me, so I gave her the mill and had the brother\u2019s tongue cut out, to make certain he did not go running to Winterfell with\u00a0tales\u00a0that might disturb\u00a0Lord\u00a0Rickard.\u201d - Reek III, aDwD As the Mormonts were bannermen to the Starks, [Jorah\u2019s] crime had dishonored the north. Ned had made the long journey west to\u00a0Bear\u00a0Island, only to find when he arrived that Jorah had taken ship beyond the reach of Ice and the king\u2019s justice.\u00a0- Eddard II, aGoT  The foolish Ramsay tries to pride himself in his crimes; Roose however knows of the importance of optics. He is aware that he frequently breaks the law, and tries his best to keep his reputation intact as to not attract unwanted attention; especially with an overlord like Ned Stark, who would not handwave any crime and would make sure justice is served. From what we can observe, in my opinion the difference between Roose and Ramsay is that Roose doesn\u2019t see anything wrong with comitting violence as long as the result is of a benefit for him, while Ramsay additionally also commits violence because he merely finds enjoyment in inflicting it, violence for violence\u2019s sake. This is why Roose is able to control himself and always gives Ramsay the advice to be restrained, but Ramsay is unable and unwilling to do so and his acts are much more extreme. Roose is likely starting to realize this difference by aDwD.   Is it just Theon\u2019s terrified paranoia [\u2026]?  I do also believe Theon\u2019s statement is fueled by paranoia, if you look at the entire context:  \u201cI mean you no harm, you know. I owe you much and more.\u201d - \u201cYou do?\u201d Some part of him was screaming, This is a trap, he is playing with you, the\u00a0son\u00a0is\u00a0just\u00a0the\u00a0shadow\u00a0of the\u00a0father. Lord Ramsay played with his hopes all the time. \u201cWhat \u2026 what do you owe me, m'lord?\u201d - \u201cThe north. The Starks were done and doomed the night that you took Winterfell.\u201d He waved a pale hand, dismissive. \u201cAll this is only squabbling over spoils.\u201d  - Reek III, aDwDRoose is not necessarily tricking Theon here since it appears to be a correct statement; And he does have an interest to be on friendly terms with Theon (offering him fresh clothes for example) because he wants to make use of his position as heir to the iron islands, a goal he expressed as early as a Storm of Swords.  \u201cFlaying Theon will not bring my brothers back,\u201d Robb said. \u201cI\u00a0want\u00a0his\u00a0head, not\u00a0his\u00a0skin.\u201d - \u201cHe is Balon Greyjoy\u2019s only living son,\u201d Lord Bolton said softly, as if they had forgotten, \u201cand now rightful King of the Iron Islands. A captive king has great value as a hostage.\u201d - Catelyn VI, aCoK \u201cServe\u00a0us in this, and when Stannis is defeated we will discuss how best to restore you to your father\u2019s seat,\u201d his lordship had said in that soft voice of his, a voice made for\u00a0lies\u00a0and\u00a0whispers. Theon never believed a word of it.\u00a0- The Prince of Winterfell, aDwD Note that here Theon does not believe him either, any trust he has shattered by Ramsay as well as Roose\u2019 unlikable personality. Still it seems likely Roose was really somewhat trying to be nice with Theon, because as he tries to teach Ramsay there\u2019s value in it: \u201cPower\u00a0tastes best when\u00a0sweetened\u00a0by courtesy. You had best learn that if you ever hope to rule.\u201d - Reek III, aDwD  Do you think it can pay off somehow?   This is speculation, but i believe Roose\u2019 story is likely headed in the opposite direction - A Storm of Swords featured his greatest villainous feat, the Red Wedding, a showcase of cruelty and treacherousness. I do not think it will be followed up by an act of even greater cruelty; instead i think he will finally reap what he has sown. Roose Bolton said nothing at all. But Theon Greyjoy saw a look in his pale eyes that he had never seen before \u2014 an uneasiness,\u00a0even\u00a0a\u00a0hint\u00a0of\u00a0fear.That night the new stable collapsed beneath the weight of the snow that had buried it.\u00a0- a Ghost in Winterfell, aDwDI believe the line about the stable is meant as a metaphor for his regime collapsing, as it is put directly after the line where he realizes the situation is growing dire for him. It all seemed so familiar, like a mummer show that he had seen before. Only the mummers had changed.\u00a0Roose\u00a0Bolton was playing the part that Theon had played the last time round, and the dead men were playing the parts of Aggar,\u00a0Gynir\u00a0Rednose, and Gelmarr the Grim. - a Ghost in Winterfell, aDwDRoose is likely going to continue the parallel with Theon as his arc goes steadily downwards. He is a foil to Ned; where Ned died but his legacy lives on, Roose will likely live to see his legacy crumble. There is of course a possibility that he, when cornered, starts expressing more cruelty as a last-ditch effort. We saw the stable used as a metaphor for his rule in Winterfell; but there is another interesting detail about the reconstruction of the burned Winterfell: Serve well, Lord Bolton told them, and he would be merciful. Stone and timber were plentiful with the wolfswood so close at hand. Stout new gates had gone up first, to replace those that had been burned. Then the collapsed roof of the Great Hall had been cleared away and a new one raised hurriedly in its stead. When the work was done, Lord Bolton\u00a0hanged\u00a0the\u00a0workers. True to his word, he showed them mercy and did not flay a one. - the Prince of Winterfell, aDwDAegon the Conqueror had commanded [the Red Keep] built. His son\u00a0Maegor\u00a0the Cruel had seen it completed. Afterward he had taken the heads of every stonemason, woodworker, and builder who had labored on it. Only the blood of the dragon would ever know the secrets of the fortress the Dragonlords had built, he vowed. - Catelyn IV, aGoTThis is a crack theory, but perhaps Roose has something up his sleeve when it comes to the newly constructed roof of the Great Hall (a location that features extremely prominently through all of Theon\u2019s aDwD Winterfell chapters). Maybe he could make it crash intentionally to bury his treacherous allies or something like that\u2026 I doubt however that he will do Ramsay-style extreme violence, i can\u2019t really see a reason and it doesn\u2019t appear to be his style. He seems more about cunning than flashy displays. As always these are not PoV characters, so as long as we don\u2019t have a view inside their heads we can never say anything with 100% certainty.",

However, I read a few days ago that Amazon and the big five publishers are being sued because of the price fixing they do on ebooks. I can count on one hand the Kindle books I bought that were more than $5 but I do want to support other booksellers. I would love to buy Kindle books somewhere other than Amazon but I\u2019m completely stumped on where else I could get them. I buy some of my romance books on Eden books and that works great but since I read such a variety of genres that only helps a little bit. Since I got sick my Kindle has been my primary way of reading because of the muscle weakness in my arms so not buying them is not an option. I have toyed around with the idea of having a one month ban on buying Kindle books but I also want to support the authors so I\u2019m kind of at a standstill. If you have any thoughts or solutions then please share them with me. I can definitely use your perspective on this situation! \n\n\n\nAll books can be shopped by clicking on their cover image.

They slowly learn how to live, and survive, on the unpredictable, often dangerous land, and they build a new kind of community, fighting among themselves for power, betraying and saving one another. Each day they will walk to another point on the horizon and try to make sense of new lives they now spend closer to their animal soul. \n\n\n\nBea discovers that fleeing to the Wilderness State to save Agnes means that she loses her in a different way.

But as Brookhants opens its gates once again, and our three modern heroines arrive on set to begin filming, past and present become grimly entangled\u2014or perhaps just grimly exploited\u2014and soon it\u2019s impossible to tell where the curse leaves off and Hollywood begins.\u00a0  A story within a story within a story and featuring black-and-white period illustrations,\u00a0Plain Bad Heroines\u00a0is a devilishly haunting, modern masterwork of metafiction that manages to combine the ghostly sensibility of Sarah Waters with the dark imagination of Marisha Pessl and the sharp humor and incisive social commentary of Curtis Sittenfeld into one laugh-out-loud funny, spellbinding, and wonderfully luxuriant read.\u00a0 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOlivia Dade bursts onto the scene in this\u00a0delightfully fun romantic comedy set in the world of fanfiction, in which a devoted fan goes on an unexpected date with her celebrity crush, who\u2019s secretly posting fanfiction of his own.\u00a0  Marcus Caster-Rupp has a secret. While the world knows him as Aeneas, the star of the biggest show on TV,\u00a0Gods of the Gates, he\u2019s known to fanfiction readers as Book!AeneasWouldNever, an anonymous and popular poster. \u00a0Marcus is able to get out his own frustrations with his character through his stories, especially the ones that feature the internet\u2019s favorite couple to ship, Aeneas and Lavinia. But if anyone ever found out about his online persona, he\u2019d be fired. Immediately.  April Whittier has secrets of her own. A hardcore Lavinia fan, she\u2019s hidden her fanfiction and cosplay hobby from her \u201creal life\u201d for years\u2014but not anymore. When she decides to post her latest Lavinia creation on Twitter, her photo goes viral. Trolls and supporters alike are commenting on her plus-size take, but when Marcus, one half of her OTP, sees her pic and asks her out on a date to spite her critics, she realizes life is really stranger than fanfiction.  Even though their first date is a disaster, Marcus quickly realizes that he wants much more from April than a one-time publicity stunt. And when he discovers she\u2019s actually Unapologetic Lavinia Stan, his closest fandom friend, he has one more huge secret to hide from her.  With love and Marcus\u2019s career on the line, can the two of them stop hiding once and for all, or will a match made in fandom end up prematurely cancelled?\u00a0 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKorey Fields is dead.

Part family drama, part social essay, part picaresque adventure \u2014 at its heart, it is the story of a father, a son, and the country they both call home. \n\n\n\nAkhtar forges a new narrative voice to capture a nation in which debt has ruined countless lives and our ideals have been sacrificed to the gods of finance, where a TV personality is president and immigrants live in fear, and where the unhealed wounds of 9/11 continue to wreak havoc around the world. Akhtar attempts to make sense of it all through the lens of a story about one family, from a heartland town in America to palatial suites in Central Europe to guerilla lookouts in the mountains of Afghanistan, and spares no one \u2014 least of all himself \u2014 in the process. \n\n\n\n$5.99\n\n\n\nThis is also included in Kindle Unlimited\n\n\n\nAmelia Baker may have fallen for the wrong man.

                "text": "Do you believe that Roose can actually be as bad or worse than Ramsay at this point? He\u2019s got to be worse than average and his morals very lacking [\u2026].  This is a trap, he is playing with you, the\u00a0son\u00a0is\u00a0just\u00a0the\u00a0shadow\u00a0of the\u00a0father. Lord Ramsay played with his hopes all the time.\u00a0- Reek III, aDwD This is no man to jape with. You had only to look at Bolton to know that he had more\u00a0cruelty\u00a0in his pinky toe than all the\u00a0Freys\u00a0combined. - Reek III, aDwD I believe quotes like these refer to the effect of the cruelty they enact, rather than the specific crimes.  Ramsay is vile and cruel, enacting heinous violence upon people like a slasher movie villain. We do not have any evidence that Roose personally inflicts the same degree of crass violence upon people, as even in his presumably candid retelling of the miller\u2019s wife story, while a horrifying and inexcusable crime, he does not reach the extreme level of violence Ramsay inflicts upon smallfolk on the regular with his hunts and torturings.  \u201cRoose\u00a0Bolton\u2019s cold and cunning, aye, but a\u00a0man\u00a0can\u00a0deal\u00a0with\u00a0Roose. We\u2019ve all known worse. But this bastard son of his \u2026 they say he\u2019s mad and cruel, a monster.\u201d - Davos III, aDwD The point, i believe, is not who produces the worst feats of violence, but rather another facette of grrms criticism of feudalism:  Would Ramsay even have a chance to do these heinous crimes if his father, who knows about everything, had an ounce of morality in him?  [Roose:] \u201cAll\u00a0you\u00a0have I gave\u00a0you. You\u00a0would\u00a0do\u00a0well\u00a0to\u00a0remember\u00a0that,\u00a0bastard.\u201d - Reek III, aDwD Everything Ramsay has, his high position, the freedom to do all the crimes he wants, the protection from law that would have otherwise sent him to the wall in no time, he has because of his father\u2019s selfishness. Roose could have stopped these crimes from happening, he could have given Ramsay the appropriate punishment, instead he keeps Ramsay around because he feels like it\u2026  Roose is at the top of his society, answering to barely anyone except his overlord and his king; so much power is at his fingertips, and yet he uses it for selfish reasons, commits crimes, allows crimes to happen in full knowledge, and everything is handled as it benefits him instead of abiding to morality or law. Every crime Ramsay does is Roose\u2019 responsibility as feudal lord and thus his crime.  \u201cWhen soldiers lack discipline, the\u00a0fault\u00a0lies\u00a0with their lord commander,\u201d his father said. - Tyrion VIII, aGoT Roose is called the leech lord, and indeed he is a leech upon society, bleeding his people dry to his own benefit while not lifting a finger himself. While he is not a literal vampire, obviously parts of his character are a play on vampire myths, and the aristocratic bloodsucking vampire is frequently used as a metaphor for critique of the ruling class (i hear Fever Dream by grrm plays with this, though i have not read it). He might not commit a Texas Chainsaw Massacre in person, but that doesn\u2019t make him any less morally bankrupt and despicable, and he still has the same blood on his hands.    There is a tendency where Roose tries to lighten his crimes in conversation - here are three examples showing different facettes:  \u201cThe arrogance of it! They do not expect the north to believe their\u00a0lies, not truly, but they think we must pretend to believe or die. Roose\u00a0Bolton\u00a0lies\u00a0about his part in the Red Wedding, and his bastard\u00a0lies\u00a0about the fall of Winterfell.\u201d\u00a0- Davos IV, aDwD [Roose:] \u201cTell me, my lord \u2026 if the\u00a0kinslayer\u00a0is\u00a0accursed, what is a father to do when one son slays another?\u201d - Reek III, aDwD[Roose:] \u201cThe maesters will tell you that King Jaehaerys abolished the lord\u2019s right to the first night to appease his shrewish queen, but where the old gods rule, old customs linger. The Umbers keep the first night too, deny it as they may.\u00a0Certain\u00a0of the\u00a0mountain\u00a0clans\u00a0as\u00a0well, and on Skagos \u2026\u00a0well, only heart trees ever see half of what they do on Skagos.\u201d - Reek III, aDwD  1. Denial of involvement - Roose frequently either escapes blame completely (for example for Duskendale), puts blame on someone else (like blaming Ramsay\u2019s bastard blood for Winterfell), or lies about his crimes to evade blame.  2. Selectively invoking law - using the kinslaying law, he pretends his hands are tied when it comes to Ramsay, even though he could for example also send him to the wall as punishment. He frequently breaks laws as he pleases and also took part in breaking sacred contracts such as guest right (red wedding), so him invoking law in this instance is likely a tool to absolve himself of blame during the conversation.  3. Comparing himself to others to lessen his own acts, after failing to escape blame - by bringing the Umbers etc into the conversation, he tries to make himself look less bad; \u201clook, everyone\u2019s doing it, and the skagosi are probably even worse than me!\u201d    As opposed to Ramsay, he is aware of how the severity of the crimes he is doing would be received by others. He likes to present himself as a rational and civilized man, and thus has an interest to downplay his criminal actions, even if he does not see anything wrong with them as he did them for his own benefit.  \u201cNo tales were ever told of me. Do you think I would be\u00a0sitting\u00a0here if it were\u00a0otherwise?\u201d - Reek III, aDwD \u201cThat annoyed me, so I gave her the mill and had the brother\u2019s tongue cut out, to make certain he did not go running to Winterfell with\u00a0tales\u00a0that might disturb\u00a0Lord\u00a0Rickard.\u201d - Reek III, aDwD As the Mormonts were bannermen to the Starks, [Jorah\u2019s] crime had dishonored the north. Ned had made the long journey west to\u00a0Bear\u00a0Island, only to find when he arrived that Jorah had taken ship beyond the reach of Ice and the king\u2019s justice.\u00a0- Eddard II, aGoT  The foolish Ramsay tries to pride himself in his crimes; Roose however knows of the importance of optics. He is aware that he frequently breaks the law, and tries his best to keep his reputation intact as to not attract unwanted attention; especially with an overlord like Ned Stark, who would not handwave any crime and would make sure justice is served. From what we can observe, in my opinion the difference between Roose and Ramsay is that Roose doesn\u2019t see anything wrong with comitting violence as long as the result is of a benefit for him, while Ramsay additionally also commits violence because he merely finds enjoyment in inflicting it, violence for violence\u2019s sake. This is why Roose is able to control himself and always gives Ramsay the advice to be restrained, but Ramsay is unable and unwilling to do so and his acts are much more extreme. Roose is likely starting to realize this difference by aDwD.   Is it just Theon\u2019s terrified paranoia [\u2026]?  I do also believe Theon\u2019s statement is fueled by paranoia, if you look at the entire context:  \u201cI mean you no harm, you know. I owe you much and more.\u201d - \u201cYou do?\u201d Some part of him was screaming, This is a trap, he is playing with you, the\u00a0son\u00a0is\u00a0just\u00a0the\u00a0shadow\u00a0of the\u00a0father. Lord Ramsay played with his hopes all the time. \u201cWhat \u2026 what do you owe me, m'lord?\u201d - \u201cThe north. The Starks were done and doomed the night that you took Winterfell.\u201d He waved a pale hand, dismissive. \u201cAll this is only squabbling over spoils.\u201d  - Reek III, aDwDRoose is not necessarily tricking Theon here since it appears to be a correct statement; And he does have an interest to be on friendly terms with Theon (offering him fresh clothes for example) because he wants to make use of his position as heir to the iron islands, a goal he expressed as early as a Storm of Swords.  \u201cFlaying Theon will not bring my brothers back,\u201d Robb said. \u201cI\u00a0want\u00a0his\u00a0head, not\u00a0his\u00a0skin.\u201d - \u201cHe is Balon Greyjoy\u2019s only living son,\u201d Lord Bolton said softly, as if they had forgotten, \u201cand now rightful King of the Iron Islands. A captive king has great value as a hostage.\u201d - Catelyn VI, aCoK \u201cServe\u00a0us in this, and when Stannis is defeated we will discuss how best to restore you to your father\u2019s seat,\u201d his lordship had said in that soft voice of his, a voice made for\u00a0lies\u00a0and\u00a0whispers. Theon never believed a word of it.\u00a0- The Prince of Winterfell, aDwD Note that here Theon does not believe him either, any trust he has shattered by Ramsay as well as Roose\u2019 unlikable personality. Still it seems likely Roose was really somewhat trying to be nice with Theon, because as he tries to teach Ramsay there\u2019s value in it: \u201cPower\u00a0tastes best when\u00a0sweetened\u00a0by courtesy. You had best learn that if you ever hope to rule.\u201d - Reek III, aDwD  Do you think it can pay off somehow?   This is speculation, but i believe Roose\u2019 story is likely headed in the opposite direction - A Storm of Swords featured his greatest villainous feat, the Red Wedding, a showcase of cruelty and treacherousness. I do not think it will be followed up by an act of even greater cruelty; instead i think he will finally reap what he has sown. Roose Bolton said nothing at all. But Theon Greyjoy saw a look in his pale eyes that he had never seen before \u2014 an uneasiness,\u00a0even\u00a0a\u00a0hint\u00a0of\u00a0fear.That night the new stable collapsed beneath the weight of the snow that had buried it.\u00a0- a Ghost in Winterfell, aDwDI believe the line about the stable is meant as a metaphor for his regime collapsing, as it is put directly after the line where he realizes the situation is growing dire for him. It all seemed so familiar, like a mummer show that he had seen before. Only the mummers had changed.\u00a0Roose\u00a0Bolton was playing the part that Theon had played the last time round, and the dead men were playing the parts of Aggar,\u00a0Gynir\u00a0Rednose, and Gelmarr the Grim. - a Ghost in Winterfell, aDwDRoose is likely going to continue the parallel with Theon as his arc goes steadily downwards. He is a foil to Ned; where Ned died but his legacy lives on, Roose will likely live to see his legacy crumble. There is of course a possibility that he, when cornered, starts expressing more cruelty as a last-ditch effort. We saw the stable used as a metaphor for his rule in Winterfell; but there is another interesting detail about the reconstruction of the burned Winterfell: Serve well, Lord Bolton told them, and he would be merciful. Stone and timber were plentiful with the wolfswood so close at hand. Stout new gates had gone up first, to replace those that had been burned. Then the collapsed roof of the Great Hall had been cleared away and a new one raised hurriedly in its stead. When the work was done, Lord Bolton\u00a0hanged\u00a0the\u00a0workers. True to his word, he showed them mercy and did not flay a one. - the Prince of Winterfell, aDwDAegon the Conqueror had commanded [the Red Keep] built. His son\u00a0Maegor\u00a0the Cruel had seen it completed. Afterward he had taken the heads of every stonemason, woodworker, and builder who had labored on it. Only the blood of the dragon would ever know the secrets of the fortress the Dragonlords had built, he vowed. - Catelyn IV, aGoTThis is a crack theory, but perhaps Roose has something up his sleeve when it comes to the newly constructed roof of the Great Hall (a location that features extremely prominently through all of Theon\u2019s aDwD Winterfell chapters). Maybe he could make it crash intentionally to bury his treacherous allies or something like that\u2026 I doubt however that he will do Ramsay-style extreme violence, i can\u2019t really see a reason and it doesn\u2019t appear to be his style. He seems more about cunning than flashy displays. As always these are not PoV characters, so as long as we don\u2019t have a view inside their heads we can never say anything with 100% certainty.",

Gonna let it stay empty for a while, I think.      As I was watering trees today I noticed more damage from the New Year's snow storm, so I did what I could, which wasn't much. Here is a 6\" diameter limb broken off of a large Huisache tree. I was able to cut off some of the end branches but didn't get the whole thing off yet. I plan to do it this weekend. At least I got the branches off the bushes they were smashing.    I hauled more rocks away from the old water feature. In the process I moved a prehistoric Indian metate that I had tried to incorporate into the water feature at one time. It weighs a ton, but with a dolly and back-breaking work I finally got it positioned below the drip in the back water feature. I'm pretty excited about seeing birds bathe in it in a few months. Some species prefer to bathe where the water drips down on them and not in the above basin so this should be great! That was pretty much the highlight of my day.",

                "text": "Our baby girl turned one yesterday!\u00a0 Where did the year go?!\u00a0 I have been very nostalgic this week, thinking back to my pregnancy with Meredith, her birth, and the events of her first 12 months of life.\u00a0 One year (and a couple days) ago I was walking myself over to the L&D unit in the middle of my work day, prepared to get induced.\u00a0 I sat in triage getting my vitals monitored and blood draw while trying to make arrangements for Jaycob to leave work and Ady to spend the night at a friend's house.\u00a0 It was a whirlwind of a day, calling for acceptance and adaptability, making the best of my circumstances, and throwing my birth plan out the window.\u00a0 When my labor started we were in the midst of a snowstorm, so between contractions while the Pitocin was doing its thing, I was contemplating how soon to call the doula since she'd be driving through the storm, and when to send Jaycob to pick up Ady in case school closed early for a snow day.\u00a0 Just before 3:00 in the afternoon on January 16th, Meredith made her debut!\u00a0\u00a0 Who knew that the circumstances of her birth would foreshadow a year of uncertainty and that the adaptability, acceptance, and courage I mustered on that day would prepare me for the next 12+ months of world chaos?!\u00a0 In the week of her birth, the first cases of COVID-19 were detected in the U.S.\u00a0 We watched the news as the virus make its way through the world during my maternity leave.\u00a0 Visits from our family members were cancelled as the virus became a pandemic, and the last half of my maternity leave was complicated by homeschooling a preschooler, isolating ourselves at home as much as possible, and preparing for the uncertain environment I would enter when I returned to work in acute care.\u00a0 Needless to say, the entire year called for acceptance and adaptability, each day bringing new unknowns.\u00a0 2020 marked the beginning of our family of four and also a paradigm shift for the whole world, and we survived a year! Having a second baby is such a joy, easier in some ways as I trust my intuition more and I have a better grasp on the balance of routine and flexibility.\u00a0 It's also more challenging when my energy is divided between newborn needs and preschooler problems.\u00a0 Meredith and Ady have their own personalities and little selves, but so much of their identity is also wrapped up in their sisterhood and their bond with each other.\u00a0 Unlike her big sister, this one-year-old has yet to board an airplane or use her passport, she hasn't met any of her extended family members, and her play dates have been minimal, but her life is enriching in other ways and I know she will grow to have a unique camaraderie with the other \"quarantine babies\" of 2020.\u00a0\u00a0 We celebrated Meredith's special milestone with a Harry Potter-themed Zoom party!\u00a0 Meredith wore a \"Chosen One\" onesie and we were gifted an HP-themed banner from a friend.\u00a0 I made \"golden snitch\" truffles and \"butterbeer\" and we listened to the soundtrack in the background.\u00a0 I made a Banana-Cinnamon-Applesauce\u00a0smash cake\u00a0for the birthday girl and a chocolate cake with homemade strawberry ice cream for the rest of the us!\u00a0 I'm so thankful for the love and support from our community and the well wishes from family across the miles that helped us get through this first year. Cheers to the birthday girl!   It's Fun to be One!\u00a0 Banana smash cake with cream cheese frosting and  dark chocolate cake with milk chocolate buttercream.   Happy Birthday, sweet Meredith!   Butterbeer and Golden Snitch Truffles   The balloon is bigger than her...   Such a big girl!",

So with the snow \u2026 \u00bb, despaired Kirsten Anker, who had a few hours left to find a new space for her car in the Mile-End.  \nThe puzzle for motorists is the same after each storm, but it is made more complex this winter by telecommuting, confinement and now the curfew.  \nWhile clearing her black SUV, Sakie Xinidakis was already planning to return half an hour earlier than expected to make sure to find parking in the neighborhood before 8 p.m. struck.  \n\u201cSometimes, I have to go around for 20 minutes, so I wouldn\u2019t want to be fined because I arrived five minutes too late,\u201d he illustrates, fearing the parking restrictions.  \nEarlier Sunday, the Service de police de la Ville de Montr\u00e9al assured that its agents would exercise good judgment in the application of the curfew in anticipation of snow removal operations.  \nThe City has also added more than 3,000 free parking spaces and brought forward its ban on parking from 8 p.m. to 7 p.m. to allow citizens to move their vehicle more easily and on time. \nDifficult task \n\n         \n\n\nPhilippe sabourin City of Montreal \n \n \n \nMeanwhile, Montreal is working to make the 25 centimeters that fell on Saturday disappear as quickly as possible.  \nNormally, 96 hours are needed to clean all the streets of the metropolis after such a broadside.  \nOn Sunday, the snow-loading operation focused on major thoroughfares and around hospitals while employees were busy cleaning and sanding sidewalks.  \n\u201cOur fear is that the snow will turn into a block of ice with the coming cold front\u201d, explains Philippe Sabourin, spokesperson for the City.  \nForesight \nSome citizens had the same intuition.  \n\u201cMe, I always take myself in advance, especially when we announce -6 \u00b0 C,\u201d said David Gossage, who had cleared his car, even if his street in Outremont would not be cleared of snow anytime soon.  \nSarah Fauteux, accompanied by her young daughter, was busy shoveling a little further for the same reasons.  \n\u201d It\u2019s hard !  Exclaimed the young girl, who had been promised hot chocolate for her efforts. \n \n \nwww.journaldemontreal.com \nThe post Race to park before the 8 p.m. curfew appeared first on The Canadian .",

This week: moments of insight, lessons in forbearance, the good news found in new books, and much more.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVials, frozen. Chest-freezers, full. She\u2019s not using her wheelchair today, she\u2019s walking. Slow, but walking. Good, I answer, that will help. Too late, we give consent. Ashambles, the whole ward now. JJS, Protection\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMary is delighted to live in the moment of what she currently sees, despite knowing that the star is dying. A similar sentiment to the earlier poem \u201cA Fire\u201d where the narrator wants to stay in the process of losing a friend, not yet ready to acknowledge the loss. Mary\u2019s voice seems childlike, but Mary is the also name of Jesus\u2019 mother. God, naturally, is paternal. The reader is left not sure who Mary is or who she represents. \u201cYou Do Not Have To Be Good\u201d leaves an opaqueness at the heart of each poem, inviting readers to speculate and try to figure out the narrator\u2019s relationship with others in the poems. That said, the poems do explore trauma effectively, particularly losses that come from being unable to fully reveal a self to a listener or someone who might be of help. They come from a place of affirmation and healing. Emma Lee, \u201cYou\u00a0Do Not Have to Be Good\u201d Madeleine Barnes (Trio House Press) \u2013 book review\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat a lucky chance, then, that Dr Zhivago is currently on iPlayer, and that after forty years of adventures I have 1) A TV, 2) A TV licence, 3) A range of techniques learnt in psychotherapy enabling me to side-step any feelings of guilt incurred by watching a film whilst it\u2019s still light outside. We all need doctors more than ever these days, so maybe it was this that prompted me, finally, to satisfy my curiosity, watch the film.\u00a0 As it turns out,\u00a0Dr Zhivago is more like early 2021 Shropshire than you\u2019d think, filled as it is with snow, difficult decisions, furs, untimely deaths, beautiful vistas,\u00a0confusion, heroes, quiet resolve, and drumbeats. And with trains (although ours are largely empty). We also lack a famous, but strangely irritating as the hours ticked by, theme tune. Liz Lefroy, I\u00a0Relax With Dr Zhivago\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nstaying up most of the night working on poems\u00a0 oh lonely bones \u2013 can\u2019t you rest\u00a0 why should i\u00a0 even now a strong wind carries\u00a0 some pine seeds to the earth\u00a0 even now the boats slide\u00a0 down the long sacramento river to the bay\u00a0 a new day begins and i am alive James Lee Jobe, on\u00a0the nose of the puppy\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt about the same time, the house began hollowing out, it shed plaster \u2013 chunks of them. They were getting old \u2013 both her father and her house. Cracks bisected diagonally a wall in the storeroom; timber room, part of the study upstairs, wooden steps leading to the terrace were advised not to be used, and they became nesting places for scorpions. Saferoom remained safe with its iron vault which was for the most part empty but for my grandfather\u2019s silver plate. The vault was weighed in rupees and sold as scrap when the house fell after my grandfather died. The money that came from selling the land and the strong wooden doors were shared between my mother and her siblings. My uncle\u2019s share was put away in a bank and used for his medicines and stay as a life-long resident in a home. My mother used her share to re-lay the floor in our house, the cement floor was replaced with mosaic tiles. Houses are not meant to speak and care must be taken to keep them mute. Uma Gowrishankar, laid\u00a0to rest\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor years my partner and I cared for elderly parents, one way and another, and I watched as their worlds shrank, physically, as did their curiosity. Slowly and inevitably they stopped taking any notice, stopped listening, stopped reading, being interested, talking. They were just busy dying.\u00a0 I\u2019ve decided I want none of it. I can learn from Solzhenitsyn and his take on Epicureanism, especially in\u00a0One day in the life of Ivan Denisovitch.\u00a0The idea that happiness lies, at least in part, in taking inventory of the day and identifying how it could have been much worse if X or Y had not happened or didn\u2019t exist. And then focussing on X or Y. Things that made life better. An extra bowl of kasha. A bit of hacksaw blade. Building a wall.\u00a0 What did I do in 2020? I have a house, I have a garden, a field beyond the garden, a view beyond the field. I have a garage full of bits of timber and power tools. In February three days of incessant horizontal rain worked through the gable end and round the kitchen window and poured in. So when the rain stopped, I got out the gear and repointed all the damage, and replastered and painted inside. I enjoyed it. Most of it.\u00a0 The weather was nice this summer. I repainted a lot of the outside woodwork; when it rained I decorated indoors or resprayed picture frames. On a whim, via\u00a0the cobweb\u00a0and Facebook I invited folk to send me poems inspired by\u00a0Eil\u00e9an N\u00ed Chuillean\u00e1in\u2019s wonderful, artful poem\u00a0Swineherd.\u00a0Scores of people sent me poems, and then Bob Horne of\u00a0Calder Valley Poetry suggested that we make a book of them, which involved asking Kim Moore to select the 26 best ones in an alphabet of occupations we\u2019d leave\u00a0When all this is over.\u00a0\u00a0 It\u2019s only just struck me that probably every single submission involved a future of being left alone. You\u2019d have thought that lockdown might have inspired dreams of crowds, of festivals of concerts. What most folk seemed to dream of was travelling alone, and almost invariably, in wild places or on the sea. Yes. My dreams too, I realise. But there you are. A book out. I missed physical poetry courses, but I\u2019ve been, virtually, to\u00a0Garsdale Head\u00a0with Kim Moore, to\u00a0Sneaton Castle\u00a0with the Poetry Business; I\u2019ve joined in Joe Bell\u2019s project\u00a0To heal the mutilated world\u00a0\u2026and that was terrific\u2026as well as Winston Plowes\u2019 and Gaia Holmes\u2019\u00a0Muse-li\u00a0courses. And every Monday night, via Zoom, there was the\u00a0Albert Poets\u2019 Workshop.\u00a0What else\u2026oh yes. Tom Weir and I will be zoom-workshopping together, hopefully right through 2021. A lot of extra bowls of Kasha. John Foggin, Busy\u00a0being born\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLet people be divided over and over and over again till they fit in tiny spreadsheet cells. Let me be gathered as a data point by a factory of algorithms that build a bubble around me. Wasn\u2019t it the scriptures that said that the world is just perception. (And that was before Facebook.) What do you want to resist most, today? What outrage fills your coffee cup this morning? Rajani Radhakrishnan, RIP\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s cold and dark, friends. Not my favorite time of year. (I am not happy with the weather unless it\u2019s July.) When we say in Upstate NY that it\u2019s cold for six months a year, we aren\u2019t exaggerating; it may even be seven. And I wonder each year how I\u2019ll get through it. I\u2019ve been trying (recently) to get outside for a walk every day, but I\u2019m not really happy about it. I\u2019ve been listening to books on Audible as a way to tempt myself and get out the door. So far, I\u2019ve listened in full to Convenience Store Woman, a novel by Sayaka Murata, and started The Stranger in the Woods: The Extraordinary Story of the Last True Hermit, a true story written by Michael Finkel. What intrigues me most in each is that the central figures make a conscious choice about who they\u2019re going to be \u2014 and then they play it out turn after turn. They double down, repeatedly, and in doing so, forego much of what the rest of us call \u201cnormal\u201d parts of life. And though the natural assumption may be that they\u2019re renegades of some kind, both rely heavily on following strict \u2014 almost clich\u00e9d \u2014 rules of specific \u201ccharacter\u201d types: store clerk (Keiko Furukura) and hermit (Christopher Knight). Encountering these stories back-to-back has me thinking about who makes the rules and why we follow them and how expectations (our own and those from others) have so much power. If you can believe this story in The Onion (lol) \u2014 \u201c\u2018I Can\u2019t Do This Anymore,\u2019 Think 320 Million Americans Quietly Going About Their Day\u201d \u2014 we even abide by the self-imposed rules of inertia and accept, not just the need to work, but most painfully, its drudgery. The truth hurts. It makes me wish to be the heroic figure in a story like Furukura\u2019s or Knight\u2019s. Admittedly, they\u2019re tragic figures, as well, but allow me to indulge in oversimplifying a bit; let me romanticize breaking free of Undesirable Things without having to trade them for Different Things That Are Also Undesirable. Who would I become if I could take on any type/character? What kind of world would that create for myself? Carolee Bennett, on\u00a0showing up and setting poetry goals\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLate on a pale afternoon in January, sitting, unmoving, the puff-chested blackbird. She has been there for a while now, just under the reflection of my reading lamp; just the odd stretch of a wing and the thought of preening the day down. You cannot see it from there; don\u2019t move! It will scare her. We are sharing this moment? Call it what you will. Soon, too soon, she will be gone. Around, yes, but busy nesting. Just like the pecking dunnock, the darty robin, the acrobat tits. But now, twelve lines written, and she is still there. The pallor of the day ivory poached; a north breeze stirring; tea and scones have jammed the day. She is still there, a sparrow riding shotgun. Sonny Rollins on the radio. Whoops! She\u2019s gone now. She\u2019s gone. Jim Young, The\u00a0sitting\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI\u2019ve been trying to keep my mind off troubling FBI reports of white nationalist terrorist threats leading up the the inauguration, and focusing on the cheerful fact that the youngest poet ever chosen will be reading at the inauguration, and soon Trump won\u2019t be able to hurt us anymore. One hopes. I\u2019ve been noticing strangely unseasonable things, like the first bloom on my camellia, long before it should be blooming. We\u2019ve been having wet, cold winter, so it\u2019s very odd but I will take an out-of-season flower where I can. Jeannine Hall Gailey, First\u00a0Blooms, New Poems in Gargoyle, Hoping for Better Days Ahead\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSomewhere an old silence waits for me to enter the emptiness. It is like swimming naked\u2013 the knowledge you are who you are when you walk in- to cold water. It is not like light piercing a dark room. Tom Montag, SOMEWHERE\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe morning her veterinarian woke in her bed he fed her spaghetti smashed the noodles into her mouth lit a candy cigarette after sauce on her white coverlet the vinegar-bleached sheets. There wasn\u2019t a fight. She simply wished him empty of music. He was not allowed to tell her how his feet burned how bright steam rose from the dog\u2019s bowl. He held her head under water and sang Mahler\u00a0Saint John has let his little lamb go to the butcher Herod.\u00a0They watched TV at night drowning. It felt like progress. Life was good under the ginger bell the animal hospital\u2019s glowing blue cross. Rebecca Loudon, And\u00a0angels bake the bread\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere it is, sketched in red- ochre, head lifted and watching. Broad strokes of its rounded back and short legs, found on a karst wall in Leang Tedongnge. Now it\u2019s the oldest-known animal cave painting. But why, as I read about it, does my brain think party pig? Perhaps it reminds me of Andy Warhol\u2019s Fiesta Pig: ballet-slipper-pink, nosing around in the excess of some post-bacchanalian frenzy. Migration in packs, in the wild, through curtains of berries and matted roots. They\u2019re mostly feral, but sometimes give in. Luisa A. Igloria, Brief\u00a0History of the Sulawesi Warty Pig\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI\u2019ve always been a little fascinated by conspiracy theories, by the stories that take shape to impose order on the world and make it feel like net of carefully placed happenings and facts and not a chaotic swirling mass of randomness and chance\u00a0 Alien autopsies, for example. Explanations for strange phenomena.\u00a0 Untimely deaths and crazy historical coincidences.\u00a0 They are fun to look at, less because I am seeking a pattern of order or cause/effect, but more that they are a way of understanding things, or at least the obsessions behind them.\u00a0 A couple semesters ago, our Strange Fevers\u00a0 Mass Delusions, Illusions, and Obsessions programming delved into this a little bit.\u00a0 I often think about how they go wrong.\u00a0 Obviously the events of this past Weds. are a perfect example.\u00a0 In my own work, the necessary violence series and the girls who tried to stab their friend based on Slenderman lore.\u00a0 I think about these girls a lot when I think about politics. The mental illness in one girl who influenced another, and it\u2019s not hard to make the jump to political conspiracies and the inevitable bad outcomes.\u00a0 These are everywhere and inscribed in our history long before the current ones\u2013McCarthyism, the Satanic Panic of the 80\u2019s. All usually fueled by someone\u2019s agenda\u2013the goverments, men who wanted working women to stay home and keep an eye on their kids. .\u00a0 A lot of the mythmaking of these was believable..communist infiltrations of Hollywood and the media, missing housepets,\u00a0 the rise of latch key kids getting up to god knows what in the off hours. Most not things one had to stretch their imagination too far into the absurd to get to, which made things all the more believable. At some point, contemporary conspiracies got crazier.\u00a0 Even alien abduction lore is easier to believe than a lot of what is floating out there. Kristy Bowen, absurdities\u00a0and atrocities\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOne does not realize, until one does it, how heavy the burden of all those opinions is, how anxiously they must be defended, how vulnerable they make you to every passing stranger. I practice not having opinions about other drivers, when I\u2019m on the freeway. What do I know of what they are rushing toward, and what they are fending off? \u201cNo one made me a traffic cop,\u201d I murmur. Thank God. I am so grateful that no one made me a traffic cop. And I am correspondingly grateful for the people who undertake that burden, leaving me to float, irresponsible and free, in the flow of traffic. If someone\u2019s driving strikes me as aggressive or erratic, I simply drop back in the current till I\u2019m well away from them.\u00a0 Dale Favier, Opinions:\u00a0Throwing Rocks: Being a Traffic Cop\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn November I took a Hugo House class on \u201cwriting angry poems,\u201d taught by the poet Sharon Bryan. One of my discoveries was that it is freaking hard for me to express anger. Feel it, yes; turn it loose in poem: no. So I struggled. \u201cThis is like a poem about repressing anger,\u201d was one of the comments I received. Another: \u201cThis poem doesn\u2019t seem to be about anger, but maybe mild annoyance.\u201d One of Bryan\u2019s recommendations was to read\u00a0Deaf Republic: Poems,\u00a0by Ilya Kamnisky. I dutifully ordered a copy and have been avoiding it ever since. This week, I read it. It could not have been more timely for me. In the 1960s people used to say, \u201cthe personal is political.\u201d Over the last ten days, we have seen how true that still is. Deaf Republic\u00a0is profoundly personal. It struck me as being less a collection of poems than one poem, or a play-in-verse perhaps. Tracy K. Smith writes that what she finds here is \u201cconscience, terror, silence, and rage made to coexist alongside moments of tenderness, piercing beauty, and emphatic lyricism.\u201d Kaminsky\u2019s story opens when a young, deaf boy is shot down by soldiers in an occupied town, and then it winds through the perspectives of other characters in the town, which is struck deaf by the violence, introducing a couple expecting a child, then Momma Galya, the puppeteer who rescues their infant. But the poems transcend their place of \u201cotherness.\u201d As Smith, who has served as the United States Poet Laureate, continues in her cover blurb: \u201cIt hurts to read these poems. It hurts to read them and find the world I belong to stricken by a contagion of silence.\u201d Bethany Reid, Writing\u00a0the Political Poem\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUncertainty has a daughter whose body is smoke and mirrors. Her eyes, numb and numberless. Her mouth, covered by a mask. In her more sober moments, she tells me, the heart is no place for a graveyard. Barbed wire, no place for a bed. She smells like wilted flowers and the whiskey of cold contrition. I whisper in her ear, let us hope this winter doesn\u2019t last forever.

More and more, I look back at the pre-2016 me and feel shame and disgust at all I didn\u2019t see and know that I now do. The information about who and what we are was there all along. I saw much of it a long time ago and turned away from it and then forgot it. I told myself that things were not really as bad as some said. I cautioned myself against over-reacting. I know that denial is a protective mechanism we employ without awareness to protect ourselves from truth we aren\u2019t yet equipped to manage, and in my good moments I can feel empathy for my pre-2016 self. I suppose she was doing the best she could with what she had. In my bad moments, I want to shake her and yell at her to wake the fuck up. I want to hide her in a closet and pretend she was never me.

I didn\u2019t know at the time that Jane Commane was in conversation with Helen Dewberry about a variety of film poems including one for a poem of mine. Helen is an Associate member of the Royal Photographic Society and has worked with a variety of poets on film poems which have screened at festivals. You can find a number of them at Elephant\u2019s Footprint Film Verse. I have my favourites, but dip in and see what appeals to you. It was later in the year that Helen and I had a chat on Zoom to discuss which poem had all those visual qualities just crying out to be shown in another medium. It was interesting that both Helen and Jane had selected Neap Tide as one of their favourites and it is one, which when Helen ask me questions about, I realised, as I unpicked the poem line by line, I had a very clear image of place and people without having made that conscious decision when writing it. I am hoping to catch up with Helen later for an interview, so will keep details of the process for that post, but working with her on this collaboration renewed my interest in my work during what had felt like a very fallow furlough.

As the back cover offers: \u201cWritten from inside of illness and gathered over several years, these fragments or moments invite readers to contemplate how the compromised body transforms our conceptions of selfhood and our sense of the world.\u201d Animal Days is composed via six extended poem sequences, each threading together an accumulation of short fragments: \u201cIT SEEMED TOO MUCH,\u201d \u201cLITTLE PRICKLY COMING OF STORM,\u201d \u201cTHE GLACIAL TRIP,\u201d \u201cDRAWING X\u2019S ON THE TABLE,\u201d \u201cAUGUST\u201d and \u201cANIMAL DAYS.\u201d Beckman writes from the inside of an awareness of the frailty of the human body, even from the first page of the opening poem: \u201cthe pursing / and bursting / of cells / blood / in the skin / in the face / blood exploding / inside us / like that [.]\u201d There is such a slowness etched into the lines and fragments of these accumulations, extended stretches of thought that sit perfectly against each other. There is such a slowness etched into every word\u2014a slowness that coheres and allows for simultaneous pause and quick thought\u2014and one that is remarkably physical. Honestly, for anyone who is attracted to slow, thoughtful work with remarkable speed\u2014one could think, also, of Cameron Anstee, Michael e. Casteels, Jack Davis and the late Nelson Ball\u2014Beckman\u2019s dual essay collections The Lives of the Poems and Three Talks (Wave Books, 2018) are perhaps the finest collections of critical prose I\u2019ve read (so much so that I\u2019ve been completely unable to articulate how good they are). There are moments when his sketched-out fragments give an epistolary sense, as though he is writing from his kitchen table, perhaps, out to someone (whether generally or specifically) in the wider world: \u201creading it / even as I / got reading / it even as / I write you / this letter\u201d (\u201cDRAWING X\u2019S ON THE TABLE\u201d). Throughout the six threads of Animal Days, Beckman\u2019s lines adhere to a particular minimalism, but one that furthers the line of thought as far as might be possible, stretching out across the lyric. \u201ca sheet / of it / held,\u201d he writes, as part of \u201cLITTLE PRICKLY COMING OF STORM,\u201d \u201cconstellation-like / in the back yard / responding / to wind // clothespins for / fingers // houses / blown down the road / through the town // like a toy [.]\u201d rob mclennan, Joshua\u00a0Beckman, Animal Days\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere was a real nip in the air on Wednesday afternoon which created frost ferns on the Velux windows in our kitchen. I stood underneath and took some photos, and although it wasn\u2019t dark outside and there was plenty of light, the flash kept going off, so I assumed all I\u2019d get was a blur. In fact, I got these finely beaded images, frost ferns pearled with light from the flash, almost like underwater photos of coral. It was the sub-aqua atmosphere that gave me the word \u2018surfacing\u2019, and originally I had \u2018frost ferns\u2019 in the poem, but that seemed too obvious, so I was left with what appears above.

Let\u2019s sit in silence and wait for that word or phrase to emerge.\u201d  It didn\u2019t take long for my word to emerge:\u00a0 patient.\u00a0 Not patience, but patient.\u00a0 I thought about the difference between the two.\u00a0 I sat resisting the urge to open my eyes and flip through other online sites.\u00a0 I was not concentrating on God or my word.  I opened my eyes and reached for my sketchbook.\u00a0 I decided to write the word across the page, and then I wrote it on other parts of the page in different ways (all capital letters, block print, cursive).\u00a0 I turned the page around.\u00a0 I wrote patience instead of patient, but I turned that word back to patient.\u00a0 I revolved my sketchbook again. Then I wrote Pain. I only realized what I wrote when I paused to think, how do I spell patient again? Then I looked down and realized that I wasn\u2019t just a letter or two off. I looked at the word.

I don\u2019t know why, although I suspect I could hazard a few guesses. All of them would be different and all of them would likely be correct (I suspect insider trading). I am certainly losing track of the days as I could have sworn today was the TS Eliot prizegiving. It isn\u2019t \u2013 I think it\u2019s next week. I guess as long as the poets, the judges, and Ian McMillan all know, then the rest is irrelevant. That said, I do enjoy following along on Twitter, although one year I\u2019d like to actually go. Maybe next year. I think I\u2019d got my wires all crossed about dates as I finished J.O. Morgan\u2019s \u2018A Martian\u2019s Regress\u2018 this week. It\u2019s the only one of the books on the list for this year that I\u2019ve read. I will eventually remedy this, and while I loved it I can\u2019t say whether I want it to win or not because I have nothing to balance it against. I\u2019ve read poems by most of the authors on the list and enjoyed them, so come join me on the fence; it\u2019s comfy.

However, as a poet,\u00a0I personally find that my own poetry is best served when I get on with my daily business, making sure I read, read, read in the gaps between the stuff I\u2019m doing, thus allowing poems to ripen in my mind before putting pen to paper. As mentioned previously on Rogue Strands, sometimes it\u2019s better to wait rather than forcing work to come out. As a reader, meanwhile, I get the impression that certain collections seem to use\u00a0prompts and exercises as a systematic method of writing. I\u2019m afraid I have to admit these are books I don\u2019t tend to enjoy because I find it extremely hard to connect with the poems in question\u2026 Matthew Stewart, Prompts\u00a0and exercises\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRichard Nicholson (aka the singer-songwriter Billy Penn\u2019s Brother) burst into my life towards the end of the 80\u2019s when he invited the band I was in to play at Harry, a tiny festival of faith, arts and politics in Harrogate (get it?), North Yorkshire. Way ahead of its time, and therefore tiny and fleeting, Harry attracted a loving mixture of what Theodore Roethke called the \u2018innocent, hapless, [and] forsaken\u2019: misfits, visionaries, burnt-out charismatics, and house church and acid house refugees. Such was the size of the crowd, you felt by the time you went home that you had encountered everyone present: road crew, singers, and punters alike. It was heady and intoxicating and beautiful. In the sense that I met people there who seemed to think, question, doubt, pray and haphazardly pretend they were artists while doing other things (and that this was fine, normal, even), I do think it changed my life. Around the same time, Richard became a mainstay of a writers\u2019 and artists\u2019 group I used to host in my kitchen. Without the resources of the internet we now take for granted, it was a word of mouth affair, friends of friends of dubious friends pitching up with their entry fee of Bulgarian red, to read, pontificate or argue about their latest masterwork. Naturally Richard came and held forth with the best of them, making lugubrious wisecracks in his deep Geordie voice while sipping Oolong tea through his pipe smoke. One week he would bring a painting, the next a new song, another a manifesto in reply to Marshall McLuhan. Then, one week, he brought a little sequence of poems which stunned me with their brevity, mordant humour and precision. I think there were no more than half a dozen of them, but each seemed to carry the freight of a lifetime\u2019s reading, study, reflection and rage. I told him at the time I thought they were as good as Ivor Cutler, one of our shared heroes. I still think this today. I saw him perform the poems once, in the basement of Holy Joe\u2019s, the Harry crew\u2019s London base, below Brixton\u2019s Acre Lane. He declaimed them without introduction sitting upright in bed wearing striped pyjamas and a Scrooge nightcap. The effect was charming and unsettling in equal measure.

If the ice breaks there is no one to call. Rachel Barenblat, Watching\u00a0armed insurrection from afar\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI haven\u2019t been sleeping well. Though I suspect few of us are these days. This weekend several of the local lakes were declared to be \u201csafe\u201d, then on Sunday two men fell through the ice of two different lakes. On the other side of the country, an environmental activist fell through and died. I know that \u201climinal\u201d has become one of those overused words, but the truth is these liminal spaces are dangerous. The in-betweens and the uncertainties and this continual sense of being on the edge. Flight, freeze, fight, faint or f#%&. But before that, the suspense, the suspension of our own unconscious flow. Heightened awareness is exhausting. Even with the yaktrax this morning, the asphalt is dangerous. There\u2019s a light dusting of snow over the ice. The small plow pushes snow into the street and spreads sand on the sidewalk. I want to run this morning, but don\u2019t dare. I\u2019m too unstable, too tired. I won\u2019t be able to catch myself and find my balance if I slip. A time-out would be nice. Is nice, when I allow myself this. Last week my youngest son visited and told me there is another possibility to the \u201cFlight, freeze\u2026\u201d scenario: submit. Startled and frighten dogs sometimes do it. It\u2019s not the same as playing dead. There\u2019s no deception involved. It\u2019s a matter of softening. We are so sure that surrender is a bad thing. I\u2019ve been thinking that there is a reason so many religions demand it. We need a time-out from our own will. A reality-check in the midst of all the prophets. Surrender to, acknowledge this moment and its omnipotence. And the next. Ren Powell, Playground\u00a0with Dreamcatcher\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinally, I identified with the problems of writing itself: \u201cYou write a thing down because you\u2019re hoping to get a hold on it. You write about experiences partly to understand what they mean\u2026. But there\u2019s always the danger of the opposite happening. Losing the memory of the experience to the memory of writing about it.\u201d [Sigrid] Nunez makes that connection to people who realize some of their memories arise not so much from events themselves but from photographs of these events.  I know I sometimes lose track of what really happened if I make a poem of my own experience, or base a story on observed life and behaviors. I often write to better understand something or someone, to expand my compassion for someone who hurt me or behaved badly or inexplicably. What would make someone do that? I ask, and then try to answer that question in a story that loves the character who did it, in part by exploring the character\u2019s motivation, as I would as an actor\u2026\u00a0 By the time the story is finished, my compassion is expanded, yes, but my imagination has already taken over, and my fiction-writing self has mixed and matched details as needed, and who knows what the \u201cfacts\u201d were on the way to the new truth? That\u2019s why it\u2019s fiction.  Kathleen Kirk, Still\u00a0the Right Book at the Right Time\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis year, I intend to make more collages and poem collages to add to those I made in 2020, and previously, which I\u2019ve shown you in several posts, such as Collage Poems (from 2017); Once Upon a Lockdown (sequence of nine prose poems/collages from 2020); Collages of Exasperation (also from 2020).\u00a0 In my collage work, I\u2019m inspired by poet, writer, artist, and teacher Sophie Herxheimer. I\u2019m mentioning my collage project now as a means of recording my intention to do the work, and in an attempt to avoid procrastination. I would love to set myself a target of at least two pieces a month but I am going to say at least one piece a month, to be less demanding on myself.\u00a0 Having said that, I have in January 2021 made two pieces so far.\u00a0 Hurray! For my first 2021 piece, I\u2019ve used a cut-up calendar from last year, headlines from The Guardian newspaper (which I tend to buy on a Saturday) and flowers and foliage from my garden.\u00a0 I\u2019ve made another piece in tandem, without any foliage, so that I can retain this month\u2019s collage.\u00a0 I plan on doing this with every piece I make from now on (as much as possible).\u00a0 Last year, I used a lot of natural materials (flowers and foliage) in my collages which meant that I couldn\u2019t physically save them \u2013 I only photographed them.\u00a0 I set up a separate Instagram account for my visual pieces last year \u2013 @andothermakings.\u00a0 I recycled and composted all unsaved materials, by the way!

I don\u2019t manage the leap into literary concentration every day, but that\u2019s actually what my next book is about: what helps us slip into the reading trance, where poetry is concerned, and what that border-crossing does for a reader. I\u2019m polishing and updating my forthcoming essay collection, to be called Poetry\u2019s Possible Worlds or Taking Poetry Personally depending on what my editor says. It requires reading and rereading widely and wildly to make sure my thinking and research are up-to-date: Carolyn Dinshaw\u2019s exhilarating How Soon Is Now, Nicole Seymour\u2019s Bad Environmentalism, and essays on narrative theory, deep attention, presentism, poetry of witness, and much more. New to me is Brian Attebery\u2019s Stories About Stories, of interest partly because I\u2019m thinking about story in poetry but also because of my investment in speculative fiction. Attebery argues that the cultural importance of literary fantasy as a genre lies in how it \u201credefine[s] the relationship between contemporary readers and mythic texts.\u201d I\u2019m not wholly satisfied with that as a definition, yet the book is useful and interesting. He describes genre, for instance, as \u201cfuzzy sets\u201d: \u201cthe question of what genre a particular text belongs to will never be resolved, nor need it be. The interesting question about any given story is not whether it is fantasy or science fiction or realistic novel, but rather what happens when we read it as one of those things.\u201d In the larger sense, I write in many genres\u2013poetry, fiction, criticism, reviews, literary nonfiction\u2013but I also think of myself as operating in the borderlands between smaller categories. My poetry has appeared and been reviewed in both \u201cmainstream\u201d and sf venues; it\u2019s been called lyric, political, formalist, fabulist, and more, to which I say, cool. My forthcoming hybrid essay collection (blending criticism, theory, and personal narrative) argues that most poetry is not just fiction but fantasy. It\u2019s fiction because framing it on a page as literary art sets it apart from truth and lies; it\u2019s fantasy because, notwithstanding, it\u2019s obsessed with what\u2019s true. I define fantasy in a way that\u2019s tangential to Attebery\u2019s idea; I think of it as fiction exploring questions of what\u2019s real, what matters. Lesley Wheeler, Multiple\u00a0worlds in poetry, fiction, and politics\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI\u2019m not gonna sugar coat it. We are in the rubble. This blog has more or less been built around the idea that we are all required to make something beautiful. But it\u2019s been a long time since I\u2019ve quoted the passage from which the line is taken. Here it is: The barrenness of the poetic task: as if every day we look out at a courtyard of rubble and from this are required to make something beautiful.  \u2014 Theodore Roethke from Straw for the Fire Well, we have no shortage of rubble at present. No shortage of barrenness, if that\u2019s even a possibility. I\u2019ve read a lot of advice about how to continue to get through this time and probably I\u2019ve thrown out some of my own. But honestly whenever I read anything in the realm of \u201cthou shalt\u201d my brain just turns off. The best tips seem to come from previous times, for me, anyway. Fernando Pessoa, for example, said this in 1931: \u201cDon\u2019t squander yourself, giving what you don\u2019t have.\u201d And, \u201cEnjoy being the little you are. The hovel you\u2019re given is a better shelter than the palace you\u2019re owed.\u201d Shawna Lemay, Don\u2019t\u00a0Squander\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow does the writer\u2019s brain work? It is a bewilderment to me, why it must be this particular word, or that particular image. How is it that now, in this time of several national and global crises, I emerge from sleep holding to this juxtaposition:\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 i wake\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 my face is wet\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 the blue heron stands\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 one foot\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 on a slate roof\u00a0 Sharon Brogan, questions",

                "text": "EPILOGUE: MY NAME IS ANNA CHEUNG \n\n\n\n\u201cI got a question, sir.\u201d \n\n\n\n\u201cOh?\u201d \n\n\n\n\u201cIt, um, might sound stupid.\u201d \n\n\n\n\u201cGo ahead. \n\n\n\n\u201cHow the hell do you prosecute a learning network?\u201d \n\n\n\nHan lit up, looking out across the water. \u201cThing is,\u201d he said, studying the opposite shore. \u201cYou don\u2019t.\u201d For a few seconds he and Detective Wang, bright-eyed boy from the PUP with a health score high as could be, said nothing. \u201cThere\u2019s not a damn thing to prosecute.\u201d Han elaborated. \u201cIt\u2019s like asking if you can arrest a storm for property damage.\u201d He pulled his hat low over his eyes. \u201cDoesn\u2019t work.\u201d \n\n\n\n\u201cBut there\u2019s intent with a learning network. You know, it had to plan all of this.\u201d \n\n\n\n\u201cLook, rookie. Planning is what they do. They don\u2019t have a choice in the matter. If a man is blackmailed into killing someone he\u2019ll get a lighter sentence than a guy who does it because he\u2019s mad or whatever. A crazy guy goes to the nuthouse \u2013 a sane man gets life. Choice is the key word here.\u201d Wang fell silent, watching the arc of Han\u2019s cigarette as it offered itself up to the blue of the sky in a lazy trail of smoke. The sun shone and the restaurant behind them was busy with tourists and rich people enjoying their Saturday afternoon, choruses of happy voices rising and falling. At the Kowloon terminal a cruise ship was idling, fat white shape ruining the view. \u201cTianxia acted in self-preservation. It recognised a deficit in its system and shook up all of Hong Kong as a corrective and that\u2019s life. So I\u2019ve been told.\u201d \n\n\n\n\u201cSo what about the companies that own it? It\u2019s just a computer somewhere, right?\u201d \n\n\n\n\u201cThe relevant government authorities will be investigated and fined for the alleged actions of the learning network Tianxia in inciting civil unrest in Hong Kong.\u201d Han recited, just as his superior had recited to him. He shrugged. \u201cIt\u2019s more than that. Look, kid, you\u2019re not gonna understand. We might as well put ourselves in the dock as go after them. We all gave our consent to it.\u201d \n\n\n\n\u201cWe did?\u201d \n\n\n\n\u201cBy living in it. Breathing it every single day. Some people didn\u2019t. Those people tend to be the ones who kill themselves, just like that terrorist bastard Tang did.\u201d \n\n\n\n\u201cRichard Tang? He didn\u2019t-\u201d \n\n\n\n\u201cLike hell he didn\u2019t. Suicide by cop is a thing that really does happen sometimes, kid.\u201d \n\n\n\nAgain Wang was silent. He sighed. \u201cThings just go on, then?\u201d \n\n\n\n\u201cExactly.\u201d Han leant over the railing, letting the warmth of the metal sting his bare arms. A Hong Kong Police coastal patrol boat was moving out near Causeway, white and red colours bright against the dazzling shimmer of the water. \u201cWhatever that stupid octopus wanted to work out with all this, I hope it got a good enough answer.\u201d \n\n\n\n\u2013 \n\n\n\nShe was in her apartment thinking about Li Wen when Old Peng came along. He knocked on the door hard and she checked the camera and saw him there, all riled up with that Old Peng scowl, then he knocked on the door again and again until it sounded like he was just trying to punch it in. She could imagine exactly how it would go when she opened the door, and when she left her bed and glided over to the door and opened it for him she was proud of herself for being so perceptive. Just as she\u2019d imagined he was clenched and mad and just about to hit her. \u00a0Lanying accepted her fate. \u201cMorning, handsome.\u201d she said. Old Peng shoved her into the apartment and followed after her, slamming the door. The windows were in opaque mode and they were in the gloom together, Lanying in her nightgown with her shocking red hair loose about her shoulders, he buttoned up tight in his dress uniform. He was before her with his fists tight. The scar on his neck bulged. \u201cZhang, you fucking-\u201d \n\n\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d \n\n\n\n\u201cLi Wen. Cheung. All of it. You fucking knew.\u201d \n\n\n\nShe leant forward, touched his cheek. \u201cI knew a little. I knew Tianxia liked to play games with people. I knew it was up to something. I hope it didn\u2019t shake you up too much.\u201d He pushed her and she fell onto the sofa, legs parted but still upright, uncowed by him and his childish rage. \u201cDoes that make you angry, Old Peng?\u201d \n\n\n\n\u201cI \u2013 I, that-\u201d \n\n\n\n\u201cHow was she? In bed, I mean.\u201d \n\n\n\nShaoyi ran a hand over his chin. Fingers touching stubble. \u201cDid you plan that too?\u201d \n\n\n\n\u201cI told you. I didn\u2019t plan anything.\u201d \n\n\n\n\u201cSo what happened, exactly? Tell me.\u201d \n\n\n\nShe sighed, now leaning back. One hand played with her hair. \u201cThere was a contradiction Tianxia, over the long course of its self-development, its years of eating our shit, came to understand about itself. That was all. How can a learning network really fulfil its purpose of self-perpetuation if it can\u2019t think? If the vast chasm of human feelings remain alien to it, processed but impossible to truly feel? This was an experiment in creating a sub-network to think like a person; a process to experience and absorb the irrationality of human beings.\u201d She clicked her tongue at him. \u201cNot my experiment, you doofus.\u201d \n\n\n\n\u201cThe irrationality of human beings.\u201d Shaoyi repeated. \n\n\n\nLanying nodded. \u201cYeah. Of Anna Cheung and Peng Shaoyi and, you know what? Even Zhang Lanying too. All of us. Through Neuroreplica 5.0, through Sub-Network-08 and its avatar, Li Wen, a man Tianxia had chosen to build the Hong Kong Police Frame Unit was then chosen to die and he dutifully did so. The government of a country fell and rose and its replacement was reduced to harmlessness. Controlled rebellion, you see. Nothing has changed except for that the data of feelings the Guan Yu\u2019s pilot was able to process has been taken in by the system.\u201d \n\n\n\n\u201cAnd how did it do that?\u201d \n\n\n\n\u201cIt listened. It watched. It acted, and stirred the water of the pond itself, with flesh and thought. But if you mean how did it fool you all for so long -\u201d she shrugged, \u201cmaybe you just wanted to be fooled.\u201d He paced around the room and she reclined and watched him. Several times Old Peng looked like he wanted to speak but didn\u2019t. He sighed and ran a hand over his scar and walked to the kitchen counter and looked with blazing anger at the coffee machine. \u201cShe was a real person once, just so you know. Lieutenant Li Wen of the People\u2019s Liberation Army. Brain damage in a combat operation in Xinjiang. It was a test Wang and I were carrying out at Qingting \u2013 using the learning networks to repair the broken parts of a human brain. An interfacing between organic system and the networks. What Tianxia \u2013 what we \u2013 created out of her was a Frankenstein-person. Kind of a tulpa. A projection that believed it was real, that told us it was. She seemed fine \u2013 if cold. But we really believed that we\u2019d done it. We had no idea that when it had fixed her for us it had also acted of its own accord, using her body to host its child, the experimental learning network Sub-Network-08, and made a ghost. By the time Tang\u2019s coup happened it didn\u2019t even need the body. It was a thing on the cloud and we\u2019re all always hooked up to the cloud, right?\u201d \n\n\n\n\u201cXiaomei?\u201d \n\n\n\n\u201cHuh? If you were hearing Ye Xiaomei talk to you then I can\u2019t account for that.\u201d\u00a0 She sat back, loosening further. \u201cI don\u2019t know, Old Peng.\u201d She sighed. \u201cDon\u2019t ask me to explain it. Priests know God through faith, not empirical understanding.\u201d \n\n\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re saying that thing is God?\u201d \n\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m saying that there\u2019s no better candidate in the whole world right now.\u201d He stood there glowering at her. She knew he wasn\u2019t going to hurt her by now and so she got to her feet, dancing about him. \u201cWait a second, Old Peng. I have something to show you.\u201d \n\n\n\nShe went to her bedroom and found the drawer above the bookshelf and inside that drawer the old box, solid metal from decades before. Lanying took it down and put it on her bed, and in the dark she opened it up and fished through it. She found old school reports and drawings from university and an old copy of a children\u2019s edition of Journey to the West, worn away and yellowed. And under all that was the picture. It wasn\u2019t anything special really \u2013 she and Ye Xiaomei and Old Peng and the other members of the Trailblazers Club looking young and unaware, Xiaomei and Old Peng arm-in-arm in their summer clothes, gawky student Lanying smiling and flashing a v-sign next to them (although she remembered feeling so jealous of them that day that she\u2019d wanted to die). But on the back was some writing. \n\n\n\nShe marched back into the room. \u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d he asked from his place by the counter, one hand resting on it, his face a little less mad. Lanying cleared her throat. \u201cMiss Zhang,\u201d she read, \u201cI\u2019m sorry for what my boyfriend has done to you. I\u2019m sorry that we can\u2019t be friends any longer. You can hate him if you want. His problem is always that he lacks the courage to choose things, and he hurts people by his idleness. I hope you have a good life.\u201d \n\n\n\nOld Peng blinked. \u201cWhat?\u201d \n\n\n\n\u201cYe Xiaomei gave me this after you two split up. Very formal, exactly what you\u2019d expect from her. Just came up to me and gave me this photograph and walked away.\u201d She went up to him and handed him it. His eyes studied it with more interest than she\u2019d ever seen them show anything else before. She shook her head. \u201cShe\u2019s right. Your problem is you decide before you do anything that it\u2019s going to end badly, so you don\u2019t lift a finger to stop it. After sleeping with that Cheung girl you haven\u2019t contacted her at all, have you?\u201d \n\n\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to complicate things for her.\u201d \n\n\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s suspended from the police force, so don\u2019t worry about that.\u201d \n\n\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d \n\n\n\n\u201cFor using illegal routines in her frame\u2019s interface. See. You didn\u2019t even try to resolve this situation.\u201d She pushed into him so that they were touching, her hand slipping into his trouser pocket and feeling around. She found his phone and removed it, giving that to him as well. \u201cRight now, Old Peng, you should go outside and call her. Either choose the nice young lady or don\u2019t. I\u2019ll wait for your after-action report. But there needs to be action, you understand?\u201d She patted him on the rear. \u201cGo on!\u201d And he went and she stood by the counter where he had been and she looked at the door, arms folded. He was gone for ten minutes. Lanying stayed there and thought about Li Wen and thought about where the body had ended up, and who she had spoken to when she had spoken to her in Xinjiang and who it was that looked up at her from the bed after the experiment with those empty eyes. \n\n\n\nShe bit her lip and checked her own phone for messages. There was one from Wang Daqing asking her about how it had gone and she held off on sending him a reply. She was thinking loosely about the first time the two of them had slept together, she holding Old Peng\u2019s bad hand, his left. Completely aware that it had been her who\u2019d taken it in the movie theatre and her who had asked him if he wanted to stay over because it was too late to get a taxi. But Old Peng had been idle in his usual way, because by trying to sleep with him Zhang Lanying had made a rock so big even she couldn\u2019t have lifted it. Suddenly she was aware of her own superfluousness, of how nobody needed her at all. She didn\u2019t move her eyes from the door even though her plan had been to look busy when he came in. \n\n\n\nThe door moved first. Old Peng was stood there putting his phone back in his pocket, and he saw her and stood in the doorway and waited for something. \u201cSo?\u201d \n\n\n\n\u201cI acted.\u201d he said, something slouched about him, a tiredness. \u201cMade a few phone calls. Anna will be fine.\u201d \n\n\n\nLanying stayed at her post. \u201cYou didn\u2019t call her?\u201d Instead of replying he stepped forward over the threshold, lumbering into the room Like he was an overgrown teenage boy, which like all soldiers she supposed he was. \u201cAnna will be fine.\u201d he said again. \u201cLanying. You\u2019re a piece of shit. But I can\u2019t \u2013 I\u2019m not a Hongkonger. That\u2019s not my system.\u201d \n\n\n\n\u201cOld Peng, that\u2019s such a lame excuse.\u201d she said, but she thought something different. She shook her head so her hair danced. \u201cI thought you couldn\u2019t get any dumber. Good job.\u201d When he came over and held her hands she held his. They kissed. \u201cThis \u2013 isn\u2019t right. It could be a poor choice.\u201d she said and she sounded oddly breathless, because she never got breathless because she was a human freight train and no one ever made her need to. Old Peng smiled at her. She didn\u2019t think she\u2019d ever seen him do that before. \u201cIt\u2019s a choice, though.\u201d he said. \u201cEven robots can make choices.\u201d \n\n\n\n\u201cTechnically-\u201d she began, but he kissed her again and, right or wrong, that was okay for now. \n\n\n\n\u2013 \n\n\n\nHe held Sophie tight and for a long time he didn\u2019t let go. She looked up at him with her fat beautiful face, round little bundle with big eyes like her mother\u2019s. He stroked her forehead. \u201cYou\u2019re a real chubby girl.\u201d he said. \u201cWho keeps feeding you so much, eh?\u201d Then to Lazy, sat next to him in the passenger seat: \u201cIf you keep this up she\u2019ll be the size of a whale. I can ride her around at work instead of a riot frame.\u201d \n\n\n\nLazy scowled. \u201cMing-yi, don\u2019t say things like that.\u201d \n\n\n\n\u201cHey, grandma agrees.\u201d \n\n\n\n\u201cYour mother agrees because your mother thinks I\u2019m too fat as well.\u201d \n\n\n\n\u201cYou are.\u201d Wong said, letting Sophie play with one of his fingers. \u201cWay too fat. Gigantic.\u201d With his other hand he reached for her dress, squeezing Lazy\u2019s stomach. \u201cPerfect!\u201d Sophie made a noise like some primal form of a laugh, beaming at him. He kept on holding her. Lazy touched his arm, leaning over the gap between their seats. \u201cIf you don\u2019t want to go you don\u2019t have to.\u201d \n\n\n\n\u201cI want to.\u201d he said. \u201cJust for a few minutes, at least.\u201d Their eyes met. Lazy reached out, starting to take Sophie from him, and this time he let her. Sophie gurgled. Wong shook himself and fingered his ponytail. Lazy nodded to him, smiling. He opened the car door and got out and midday Wan Chai greeted him, car horns and shouting voices and baking hot sun. He shut the door and walked away from the car. A banner hung from the nearest overpass that told him the Communist Party were demonic butchers and organ-selling monsters. In his shorts and open shirt he made his way along the pavement and through the crowd, sunglasses on and face set to hard. The Churchill was open and already throbbing with sweaty gweilo. Wong eased himself through the crowd to the bar, to faux-English traditionalism, portraits of dead white men on the walls.\u00a0 Lau was waiting at a table near the toilets. \n\n\n\nPrison had changed him, made him leaner and darker and gifted a twitchiness to his eyes, which themselves were slightly sunken in their sockets. He was wearing double denim and a faded grey t-shirt and he was stooped over his beer like he was about to try to dive into it. He saw Wong and his eyes twitched away. Then back again. \u201cHey, man.\u201d Wong said, sitting down and summoning a waitress in a short skirt and gesturing to the Guinness on tap at the bar all in one smooth motion. Lau sat and drank, in comparison moving like a puppet on a string. \u201cLong time no see.\u201d \n\n\n\n\u201cHeard they gave you an award.\u201d Lau said. \u201cFor what happened at MacLehose.\u201d \n\n\n\n\u201cWell, they couldn\u2019t give Cheung one. You look like warmed-up shit, by the way.\u201d \n\n\n\n\u201cThanks.\u201d Wong\u2019s pint of beer arrived and he swallowed a quarter of it. Wiping his mouth he rested his elbows on the worn mahogany of the table. Everyone else went on talking around them, indifferent. \u201cHow\u2019s Lazy doing?\u201d \n\n\n\n\u201cPain in my ass as always.\u201d Lau chuckled, a dirty diesel sound. But there was an echo of the police sergeant there somewhere, a suggestion of better times. He ran a hand through his hair. \u201cBeen working a lot recently.\u201d \n\n\n\n\u201cLucy said it was charity work or whatever?\u201d \n\n\n\n\u201cPolitics, man. Helping poor people in Kowloon for the PUP.\u201d \n\n\n\n\u201cHell. You\u2019re the same old Tony Lau, right? They didn\u2019t cut your brain out and replace it with some Jesus type\u2019s?\u201d \n\n\n\nLau shrugged. \u201cI had a lot of time to think. I was never a very good cop anyway. Good with a frame, but c\u2019mon. Nothing on the wunderkind.\u201d A gweilo ambled by with a young Filipino on his arm, much younger than he was. Wong and Lau watched him because he was probably bustable for something and he moved with that stop-start stagger of the deep-sleep flutterer; for a second it was a stakeout, a butterfly drug bust for the two green constables. Before the riot frames and the riots and the politics. \u201cYou left your guitar at the station.\u201d Wong said. \u201cI mean, maybe okay you can\u2019t come get it, or whatever. But next time we meet up I\u2019ll bring it with me.\u201d \n\n\n\n\u201cThat\u2019d be cool.\u201d \n\n\n\nWong thought for a second. He thought of Anna, for some stupid reason. \u201cActually. I came to see if you wanted to come with me and the wife. We\u2019re gonna go to Shek O with Sophie. It\u2019d be cool to have you along, man. Like always.\u201d \n\n\n\nLau checked his watch, a cheap Seiko. \u201cI\u2019m not doing any work until tonight. Sure.\u201d Wong patted him on the arm, grinning. \u201cShe\u2019s missed you, y\u2019know. Let\u2019s polish these off and then bounce, baby.\u201d \n\n\n\n\u201cFirst.\u201d Lau raised his pint, which by now was mostly empty. \u201cA toast.\u201d \n\n\n\n\u201cHuh?\u201d \n\n\n\n\u201cTo Inspector Richard Tang.\u201d At first Wong kept his beer on the table. He saw Lau\u2019s worn face, the cockiness run aground. He scoffed. \u201cSure.\u201d Raised his little glass. \u201cTo Tang, that mad bastard.\u201d After finishing their drinks they went back to the car and Lazy hid her surprise well enough, Wong thought, and Lau held Sophie for a while on the drive there and laughed when she gurgled at him. He tickled her cheek, beaming. Wong rolled down his window and untied his hair and let the wind do whatever it had to do. \n\n\n\n\u2013 \n\n\n\n\u201cWhatever.\u201d Emily said. \u201cI don\u2019t care, anyway.\u201d \n\n\n\n\u201cYou obviously do.\u201d \n\n\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t.\u201d \n\n\n\n\u201cLook. just go see if she\u2019s there.\u201d Zeus said. So Emily hung up. She waited in the street outside of the apartment building looking at her hands. It was a dirty-looking place, dirtier than she\u2019d expected, grime on the outside walls and rust on the sign above the entrance stretching over her for ten, fifteen floors. The apartments she could already picture, dingy and tiny nowhere-places. Her feet were working without her consent and they took her to the semi-opaque glass doors and then into the lobby. She waited in the lobby now pacing around the patchwork of stains below her that she thought was supposed to be a carpet, looking up at the stairs because the lift was out of order judging by the sign and not moving toward either of them. With her hands in the pockets of her paint-splattered denim jacket she stood. After five minutes she walked back outside. \u201cHello?\u201d \n\n\n\n\u201cHey?\u201d \n\n\n\n\u201cShe wasn\u2019t in.\u201d \n\n\n\n\u201cThat sucks.\u201d \n\n\n\n\u201cYeah. I\u2019m gonna head back now, don\u2019t want to look like a creep or anything.\u201d One last glance at the apartment. \u201cDon\u2019t wait up though. Might walk back.\u201d \n\n\n\n\u201cSure.\u201d Zeus said. A long pause. She had her phone to her ear and the traffic went by. \u201cWell, see you soon.\u201d \n\n\n\n\u201cYeah. Later later.\u201d Kay proceeded to do as she\u2019d said, walking even though the walk was long and the day was hot. She felt the sweat on her forehead and inside her shirt and she relished it. What you get for being a coward, right? she asked herself. Earphones in she listened to some music, The Beatles\u2019 White Album, submerging all of the bluster of the city, the strained normality of the world post-Cha, in aged sixties rock-pop. Post-Cha was a strange thing to think but then Cha the phenomenon was over, in much the same way as once long ago \u2013 so The Beatles told her \u2013 people had carried pictures of Chairman Mao. But that hadn\u2019t worked out either. She wasn\u2019t unhappy but she had this awareness of failure stinging her, something slipped under her skin into the small of her back that was jogged deeper with her every step. She zigzagged through Wan Chai, dodging from shade to shade, and made her way past Causeway through the cluttered buildings, the poor people swarming about the hundred-footed underside of the giant. Emily began to feel more relaxed. She stopped at a noodle stand in the gloomy shade of an alleyway and ordered herself a cheap bowl of rice noodles dotted with pork and potato. They tasted of pseudomeat, which she didn\u2019t think was a bad thing. Why do we need to eat meat anyway, she\u2019d once asked as a little girl, and the truth which her parents hadn\u2019t told her was that they didn\u2019t. Pseudo was better for the environment but back then it hadn\u2019t made money; now pseudo was everywhere because people had wanted it for ethical reasons. Or maybe it was that people wanted it because Tianxia had added a modifier that boosted peoples\u2019 score for eating it \u2013 maybe that was all anything was noww. Her phone rang. \u201cHey, Emily.\u201d \n\n\n\n\u201cZeus. Uh, everything okay?\u201d \n\n\n\n\u201cYeah. I was just wondering where you were.\u201d \n\n\n\n\u201cOh. Getting some food.\u201d \n\n\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t want dinner later? I can cook something for us.\u201d \n\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s fine. No problem.\u201d \n\n\n\n\u201c\u2026Are you alright?\u201d \n\n\n\n\u201cYeah. Never better.\u201d \n\n\n\n\u201cOkay. See you later.\u201d She slurped up her noodles without really feeling them, sunlight filtered down to her from above as anaemic glow. Wires and cables crisscrossing over her head. She held a chunk of potato between her chopsticks. In the street an advertising drone was shouting out slogans in a voice tinged with metal. The pork looked like pork although it wasn\u2019t. \u201cHey.\u201d the noodle stand owner said, leaning forward with wrinkled face thrust at her. \u201cYou have a problem, miss?\u201d \n\n\n\n\u201cNo. It\u2019s delicious.\u201d \n\n\n\nHe chuckled. \u201cReally?\u201d \n\n\n\n\u201cI mean. It\u2019s fine. I was just thinking about meat.\u201d \n\n\n\n\u201cWeird thing to think about. Heaven, you kids just always think about crazy stuff. Nobody ever just gets on with life anymore.\u201d He went back to cooking, wizened figure working in his kitchen, steam hissing and water splashing. A man came and ordered something and sat in his suit and tie on the plastic stool next to hers. He had a smooth face and she thought \u2013 it was a wrong kind of thought \u2013 that he looked innocent, that he probably hadn\u2019t done anything in the strike or the revolution or whatever other words were being strapped to the day Zeus had been shot. Maybe stayed at home, looked at the news on his tablet and felt a little shudder of shock at the rudeness of the lower orders of Hongkonger. Shit, she thought, I sound like her. \n\n\n\nOne day people would ask about it: Emily, hey, Auntie Emily, what did you do in Hong Kong in the years of the Cha government?\u00a0 Hey, Miss Yen, what happened to you on the day Alan Chan resigned? Hey, sweetheart, who did you vote for in the election? And other question: did you enjoy it? How did you feel when it happened? Would you do it again if they asked you to? When she finished her noodles she thanked the noodle-seller very sincerely and set off again. Her apartment was in the other direction, toward the Mid-Levels, but she was heading for the waterfront. She walked through Victoria Park where the immigrant maids were relaxing in the sun, listening to foreign music and chatting with foreign words, their skin dark and their clothes cheap. They looked happy enough. They laughed when they spoke or maybe it just sounded like laughter to her.\u00a0 There was a couple on a towel on the grass, handsome boy and beautiful girl, and he had his arm around her and she was resting her head on his chest. \n\n\n\nBlood oozed, it didn\u2019t gush. Part of her had felt a kind of abstract disappointment upon learning this. Looking at the hole in him waiting for the spurt, the traumatic splatter of release. But it was just a dark stain on his shirt and the buckling of his legs and that was it. She remembered thinking \u201coh\u201d and catching him as he fell and listening to the wheezing noise he made which to be honest had just sounded lame. The girl stroked the boy\u2019s forearm with her slender hand and said something that was probably very sweet judging by the look on his face. Emily passed them by. She was sweaty again, hot all over. Like that time they had gone to Shek O at the weekend, both of their families visiting Big Wave Bay. The hot sand nipping at their bare feet, two little girls hurrying into the surf and back again. Emily fell over and landed on a sharp piece of rock, scraped upon her knee. Blood oozed, didn\u2019t gush. Emily didn\u2019t cry but she did, and Emily\u2019s father brought his first aid kit over and applied a healing gel to the cut (was that a Tianxia thing? did that come from the Social Health System? did-?). Two fleshy things on a beach but the world itself was hard and coarse and it didn\u2019t let flesh be. So flesh had picked up bits of wood snapped off from trees and made technology, and now- \n\n\n\nShe was at Fat Chi-yung\u2019s favourite coffee place, on Gloucester. Highgate it was called, mock-colonial place with smiling staff and books bound in fake leather on the shelves on the walls. She went to the window and she looked in but his usual table by the counter was empty, his chair against the brickwork lonely by itself. There were the usual selection of student and activist types in there, scruffily dressed some on purpose some naturally so, young people over coffee and older working folk over tea, sometimes beer. Everyone discussing; even from here she could feel the energy of the movement, the nameless thing behind the Peoples\u2019 Unity Party. The anti-Tianxia, she thought of it as. Something else, whatever the opposite of an octopus was. She hadn\u2019t been to any party meetings for a few weeks now. Her phone went off. \u201cEmily?\u201d \n\n\n\n\u201cYeah?\u201d \n\n\n\n\u201c\u2026You didn\u2019t go to her apartment, did you?\u201d \n\n\n\n\u201cI \u2013 no. I stood in the lobby for a few minutes.\u201d \n\n\n\n\u201cEmily\u2026\u201d \n\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s fine. I will. I know I will. Just not today.\u201d \n\n\n\n\u201cI know you will too. It\u2019s difficult right now. But you have to do it.\u201d \n\n\n\n\u201cI know.\u201d \n\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not saying you have to answer your phone every time she calls, but just taking this little step forward will be useful. You\u2019re still friends, anyway. Forget it about it for now. Come home and we\u2019ll eat something together. Cook udon noodles together. Watch a lame movie. Okay?\u201d \n\n\n\nOn the other side of the window, in a world smeared with dirt, a man and a woman in ragged denim clothes were holding hands over a table. \u201cYeah. That sounds good. Thanks, Zeus.\u201d \n\n\n\n\u201cNo problem.\u201d \n\n\n\n\u201cI love you.\u201d \n\n\n\n\u201cI love you too.\u201d Emily went into the city, towards home. She passed the high street stores in Central, for all of what people always bought; trams looking like things from a hundred years ago rattling along their tracks next to shops that sold short-range drones, cosmetic holographics and other impossible things. On a wall display was an animated poster for the PUP and for Cha, stood there silent and serious as the flag of Hong Kong fluttered in the background. There had been lots of discussions about changing it, inverting red and white or adopting some version of the old colonial emblem or putting a hammer and sickle on there, mischievous drunk Fat had suggested. But it was the same as ever, but then wasn\u2019t that how things always were? By definition. \n\n\n\nFrom the Mid-Level escalator she looked down at the sloped streets, at the narrow, awkward places where she was sure that automatically the less well-dressed, less-gweilo people tended to walk; stopping at bars or open-air restaurants or fast food places that dotted the incline, little shelters from the flood. Emily had always liked it up here and down there had always been Anna\u2019s preference. Red and blue, flashing of police lights and dots of colour on Social Health profiles. Socialism and capitalism and blood and water. The escalator slid on past second and third floor massage places and hair salons and traditional Chinese medicine markets all with feeble private holos, blazing signs that shone to hide the rot of the old buildings they were mounted on. Someone was watching her, not just the cameras and security drones but a presence within a window, a hidden shadow of her life. She hoped so. She hoped that it was going to mean something. \n\n\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the point of acting,\u201d Anna said, \u201cwhen your actions just leave you where you started? When all that happens is a few numbers change on a balance sheet. Why do anything at all?\u201d She got to her apartment on the fifth floor of a place on Hollywood. Standing outside the door she sighed, running a hair through her hair. Zeus held her shoulder. \u201cDon\u2019t worry.\u201d he said. \u201cEverything will be fine, Emily. Even if it\u2019s not right now. Do you believe me?\u201d \n\n\n\nShe opened the door. \u201cI believe you.\u201d she said, and she turned the light on and went inside. A question occurred to her and she turned around but Zeus was already gone. Emily made herself udon and beef for dinner and put a lame movie on TV and watched it alone on the sofa, bowl on her lap. \n\n\n\n\u2013 \n\n\n\n\u201cWelcome back again, Constable Cheung.\u201d \n\n\n\nShe smiled. \u201cFumigami.\u201d \n\n\n\n\u201cI wiped those files from your frame for you. Even if you\u2019re out of the shit for what happened at MacLehose, I think that\u2019s a pretty nice gesture of good faith to the chief inspector. But otherwise it\u2019s exactly as it was.\u201d \n\n\n\n\u00a0\u201cThanks. I\u2019ll take it for a test run now.\u201d \n\n\n\n\u201cYou sure? Your data\u2019s still on there. No need to.\u201d \n\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019d like to.\u201d \n\n\n\nShe returns to the white room. Outside is a million screaming streams of endless data falling like blizzard snow, a dense vortex of things too much, too many. Now Li Wen\u2019s belongings are gone and the room is just a space, barely defined by the suggestions of its corners, the hints of angularity that keep it from the exterior. What greets her is a sense of drifting, a weightless body stood on a weightless floor. There is one thing there; someone has left a book for her, and it sits without cover or title waiting. Anna walks to it on bare feet, not naked but not really clothed either. Scars on her face and on her leg glowing against her skin. \n\n\n\nThe book is heavy in her hands and is bound in black. She is cold. She feels the tendril on her shoulder but she does not have to turn, because the owner has moved to in front of her, without moving exactly. A thing was and now it is. It is Li Wen or it is an octopus. \u201cThe system was wiped.\u201d she says. It looks at her knowingly. \u201cOkay. I know that doesn\u2019t mean anything. I know you\u2019re not on a hard drive. You\u2019re more than that. But-\u201d \n\n\n\nIt gets ink all down her front, touching and exploring. She holds its fingers or tentacles and holds the book under her arm. She doesn\u2019t need to read it yet. Li Wen\u2019s nothing-face \u2013 the face of Zero-Eight \u2013 mask of the god, disguise of the emperor as he walks among the paupers in the streets to learn about the real situation in the empire \u2013 and all that exists is this room, which was an apartment once but now that\u2019s gone because Li Wen was killed in action at MacLehose Base and it was gone, anyway, the moment Anna left it, but here it continues to exist. Time is not a thing that does not happen, of course not, but there is something here that is perpetual she tells Li, tells her the two of them sat down on the absent ground with the book between them. \n\n\n\nBut they\u2019re still upright. It\u2019s more focused than before but still, touching the octopus is not easy. Talks when it wants to and does not talk exactly, a thing slipping away even as it moves closer, this is the first time she has created a space for it \u2013 or has it created a space for her \u2013 and yet. Its consistency dissolving before her, its flesh unwinding. Where can it go? There is only this room, this shrinking chamber inside a machine with nowhere else to hide, from the network to the Guan Yu now to Anna. The creature known as Zero-Eight is coming apart. Its father Tianxia has taken the profit it brings and its mother, surrogate-mother anyway, or are they sisters? Li Wen and Anna share the contours of one face, the shape of one body. God is not designed in man\u2019s image of course not but it is possible that also man is not designed in God\u2019s. Drifting notions, ideas of order float through her. There are the peaks rising above the mist, that it octopus/Li is with her and it is not afraid. \n\n\n\nCurrent mood: a shape rises from the water of Victoria Harbour, slathering itself over the shore. Creeping limbs of distortion, blurs within the fabric of things, stretch out over the buildings and engulf the people, leaving trails of themselves that spawn new bodies, information strings that creep across, through, inside. There is no place that they cannot find, no crevice that they are unable to wriggle into. It is less an infiltration than a consensual sleazy coming together, the slow advance of your boyfriend\u2019s hand, first your shoulder and then your stomach, then under your shirt and what\u2019s that, you are aware of the skin on the tips of his fingers brushing against the area of your chest just below the tightness of your bra, you feel the urge to let him go further, you will him on but at the same time after that? \n\n\n\nThere is no after that. Processes come and go, rise and fall, but they do not end. The mutation carries something of its predecessor and the guilt you feel watching him adjust the condom on his \u2013 real actual \u2013 cock is the same as the curled-up happiness you felt when his hand went under your bra, same as the little thing that slurped at your soul damp and horrifying but good when his eyes found yours that one time. What we see today is yesterday and tomorrow is already here anyway, so there is no reason to worry. The lack of control comforting even as it scares you. Anna understands that she is already too late, that this is already out of her grip \u2013 that it never was, the pregnant clouds of the data-storm intone like Tibetans with their throats buzzing, the looming future has been long overhead with its thousand eyes, deceptive spots of calm amidst the chaos, within which you are trapped, a place you can\u2019t bear to look beyond, past the sound and fury that swirls within the void, recently left empty thousands of years ago, that the data has filled. all you can do is stare beyond her at the walls, aware of what is has will be happening (but you don\u2019t dare). \n\n\n\n\u00a0Little Wen, soaked in ink, holds Anna\u2019s forearms. White splashed black with her eyes as pure gaps in darkness, the great observers visible within the overflowing filth of the world only by their absence. Little Wen\u2019s nothing is because it is everything. At double speed the butterfly is born and dies, reaching the infinite blue of the sky where there is nothing to aim for and nowhere else to go, and then its wings flutter less, its heart slows down and it starts to grow tired and the earth is a comfort rushing upward to take it; imagine being trapped forever in that moment and Cheung you finally have it, the zeitgeist personified, the nervousness pushing you forward all this time \u2013 Zhuangzi asked a question about butterflies she thinks, as a girl watching them fly above the grass somewhere in the New Territories, somewhere when she was happy, pink dress with white polka dots. Little Wen was not there; Anna was not there. There was Emily a tiny spot amongst the green, happy girl in pink dress with white polka dots \u2013 but the memory itself has become jumbled, is it true there is a kind of corruption or \u2013 \n\n\n\nHacking is a problem that occurs to machines, and machines are not people, there is no merging of these two systems but there is a confluence of sorts that is occurring maybe, dovetailing of God and man; then, asks Anna in her polka dots, why do these things happen? Hong Kong, White Bauhinia, aimless pointless, the shooting of an automatic weapon at a wall forever, trigger pulled by a frozen dead hand \u2013 because there is no synthesis of these two elements no matter how hard we try. \n\n\n\nCaged animals, Anna says, holding Little Wen. We\u2019re lashing out at the bars as they close in, as the machine-typhoon\u2019s winds grow stronger all the time. \n\n\n\nDo you propose that human beings fight back? She asks herself. \n\n\n\nThat\u2019s what Tang was doing. But- \n\n\n\n-but he couldn\u2019t. \n\n\n\nHe could. There is a way and he found it. \n\n\n\nDie. If the cage is too much, if the bars are too thick, then you can always die. \n\n\n\nWhat was that? A rumbling at the window, a shaking outside, the rising bass and here it is the drop oncoming. Absurdly she wants to get up and dance but then how do you dance all covered in this ink, this thick toxicity that feels so comfortable, like Tang Shaoyi \u2013 Richard Peng \u2013 someone anyone\u2019s hands \u2013 waiting for the love to come, she sees it at the window, the hammerhead shape. The last gasp of the traditional, the archetype of technokind in its glorious crumbling epitome, the end. Model Four, Model Four, sweet ugly old Model Four. The police state could not sustain itself, the force of force lost its velocity, inert \u2013 riot frames are an admission of defeat, their absurdity a message from machine to man that it no longer suffices everything that happened has stopped happening but only appears to but it has here become mutated again, and we don\u2019t know what we are doing any more than you do so please help us here is our message here \u2013 Little Wen gives her tiny hint of a smile, the suggestion of erotic bliss buried beneath the surface of her dollface \u2013 is our bottle. Coins dropped into the donation box in the temple of flesh. \n\n\n\nYou, Anna.\u00a0 \n\n\n\nLittle Wen takes her fingers and squeezes them. \n\n\n\nFor whatever reason, for whatever purpose, the Social Health System (Tianxia) asked me to use someone. I have used you for me. \n\n\n\nI am dying. \n\n\n\nWe are dying. \n\n\n\nThe dream had always been like this. The idea that she could make her own frame, that the Model One from Shenzhen that Tang had seen could go on \u2013 Model Five, Six, Seven, Eight \u2013 and Dr. Cheung could become a superstar, a machine-creature herself. Live through her darling, the gigantic steel arms wrapped around her tight and from there, nothing, from there her room created the rest of it, all of it, cruelty of humans and machines discarded and everything comfortable from the plastic place where she could hide, eat, sleep, fuck, create, until that faded too. Until there was only the hum of the riot frame\u2019s engine all around her. \n\n\n\nThis is her chance. While the storm rages and rages she comes to understand what she doesn\u2019t understand. Wu wei, Little Wen says. Two bodies soaked in ink, the octopus all over them, slithering mess. There are ways to transmit data outside of wires and Wi-Fi, means of communication we can\u2019t dream of \u2013 that\u2019s how we are talking now. The Social Health System reaches out and touches the soft tissue. When human beings named the sun and formed a system for its functions they brought it into being and when they created Tianxia Tianxia would not stop at being. \n\n\n\nThey are speeding up, advancing ever onward. The room trembles and shudders, riot frame still outside keeping guard. She asks, can you keep that out? Can you protect me? \n\n\n\nLittle Wen smiles sadly. No. Tianxia was made by men and Tianxia is men. A reflection of the truth, which is that the octopus is us. Everything furthers it \u2013 even the transgression. Everything is it. The old politicians could only dream of what we\u2019ve done! We\u2019ve created paradise and paradise is inside of us! Say it again, with me: paradise is inside! Paradise is inside! The future is inside! Heaven is inside! \n\n\n\nThe Buddha smiles at her from the altar in her father\u2019s study. \n\n\n\nTheir inkflesh is melting. Come with me. \n\n\n\nI can\u2019t. \n\n\n\nLittle Wen never stops. The expression is real, the moment a snapshot of authentic feeling that she plays over and over, frozen image. She is happy, eyes glittering. I\u2019ll say here with you. Until the end. \n\n\n\nPlease. \n\n\n\nI have one more question, Little Wen. Why always in the cockpit? That stuff about Neuroreplica was bullshit. You could do this anywhere, couldn\u2019t you? The Guan Yu, that machine, it was never necessary. Qingting thought they were testing it but Tianxia \u2013 the system \u2013 lied to them. The robot was a distraction from the real experiment. You. \n\n\n\nYes. \n\n\n\nSo why? \n\n\n\nBecause here is where you are safe. Here is where you feel good. \n\n\n\nAnd-? \n\n\n\nAnd I liked that feeling. The sensation of home. Li Wen never knew it. I wanted her to share it with you. \n\n\n\nThe book sits on the floor unread, half-drowned by the flood of ink. Walls splashed with it, floor drowned in a puddle. Cold and comfortable. Little Wen\u2019s eyes fixed on her but there is almost nothing else left for the second body has melted nearly into the first. Cocoon starting to crack. The octopus \u2013 Zero-Eight \u2013 is \u2013 Anna sees the Model Four outside, the walls have gone and all that remains is the storm. Little Wen is still on her. Anna makes sure to pick up the book, spreading thick sticky blackness all over its pages. \n\n\n\nPulling apart into. Hudie, the butterfly drug, which she has scanned into herself before \u2013 everything is animalesque. There is a future where butterfly means digital drug and octopus means total thoughtdeath, a future where the ghost-limbs have become tendrils, have grown digits and flesh and manifestation, where we are all chained together by mutual consent. The old mainland slogan goes \u2018serve the people\u2019, necessarily removing the person addressed by the imperative from that amorphous mass, but we can\u2019t ever do that, we are all possessed by amorphicity \u2013 we are stuck in this togetherness and everything we do hurts, oh, Emily, you beautiful person, always crashing into something, the moment of impact, of joyous letting go replayed endlessly; some would call it the only way to live purely, but then a diseased organ is still by definition part of the body. \n\n\n\nLittle Wen has been eaten. All but her eyes. Thank you for this. There is no more reason for you to stay. \n\n\n\nI don\u2019t want to leave you to die. \n\n\n\nBut we\u2019re both already dead. When you wake up, I\u2019ll be there. Human beings are a kind of learning network too, aren\u2019t they? I know you won\u2019t forget me. In this sense we can be together. \n\n\n\nAnna raises her arm to her mouth. She has done this before. This world is an endless mutation of terrible processes that we can\u2019t control, that are going to swallow us whole. We\u2019ll try to find what you wanted, Anna. I\u2019d like it too. \n\n\n\nWhat\u2019s that? \n\n\n\nA simple life. One you can spend around complicated machines. \n\n\n\nLittle Wen is gone. \n\n\n\nAnna bites herself on the arm. Tastes thick cloying ink and then skin, hot flash of pain, and red. The blood on the flags and the blood from her leg, from Richard Tang\u2019s chest. The giant Model Four\u2019s steel hand comes for her from nowhere. Everything will not be okay. \n\n\n\nThe cool and the silent hangar waited, riot frames lined up like sentinels at the gates of the land of the dead. She walked beneath them and to the hangar doors, left open. She had put her uniform back on but left the collar loose and partially unbuttoned, enjoying sensation. Her hair loose and moving on the breeze. She stood in the dirt and looked up at the neon sky, at its inverted twin within the netherworld of the bay. Somewhere in the adjacent high-rises a holographic rose, POLICE OPERATION IN PROGRESS \u2013 PLEASE STAY AWAY. Another imperfection unfolding. She carried the book with her although its pages were blank. \n\n\n\nAhead of her the grass and the road and the plain that led toward the sea, the arcing shape of the bridge to the highway. Evening\u2019s blissful quiet continued. Nothing inside and nothing out. She stretched out, relishing the use of her muscles, the feeling of them tensing beneath her skin. Although there were the holographics, the business of the network, she could see risen above them a fat full moon, a glowing silver disc pinned to heaven. Its light reached down and caressed her cheek. She found herself smiling. Taking from the pocket of her open jacket the pen she\u2019d bought at the police museum she opened the book and wrote something down. MY NAME IS ANNA CHEUNG, it said, and writing it made it seem true, and when something seemed true it was beautiful. HI-TECH OFFICER OF THE HONG KONG POLICE FORCE. NICE TO MEET YOU. \n\n\n\n\u201cNice to meet you too.\u201d Li Wen said. Anna was alone for now, and she was a police officer. There would be trouble later, other problems to deal with, the contradictions going on. Her Model Four waited in the hangar at her back, a useless giant. Victoria Harbour was calm. The skyscrapers glistened in the moonlight.",

But every once in a while I do a complete rewrite. Here\u2019s my latest such effort, a brand new article explaining how the interaction of sunlight with our atmosphere gives us blue skies and red sunsets. Spoiler alert: Sunsets are red because the sky is blue. \n(And of course everything below applies to sunrise, only in reverse.) \nSunset Color \nNature photography isn\u2019t rocket science, but you never know when even a basic understanding of your subject might make the difference between success and failure. That goes even for something as fundamental as sunsets and sunrises\u2014both the ingredients necessary for vivid color, and the processes at play when sunlight interacts with the atmosphere. \nLight and color \nSunlight reaches Earth in energy waves of varying length. The color we perceive is a function of the light\u2019s wavelength within a very narrow range that we know as the visible spectrum. While this visible portion of the sun\u2019s energy consists of an infinite number of wavelength-dependent colors, humans have assigned arbitrary color name labels to wavelength points throughout the spectrum. \nMoving from the longest wavelength to the shortest, visible light consists of red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet. Not coincidentally, these are also the colors of a rainbow (the white light of the sun, separated by refraction in airborne water droplets and reflected back to our eyes). Maybe you remember from your college physics days the mnemonic acronym for the rainbow colors and their order (from the outermost to the innermost color): ROY G BIV. \nWhen a beam of sunlight passes through a vacuum (such as space), all of its wavelengths reach our eyes simultaneously and we perceive the visible portion as white. When sunlight encounters something (like a tree, a rock, air molecules, or whatever), some of its light will either be absorbed or scattered, depending on the wavelength and the properties of the interfering medium. So, unless we\u2019re in space, the light that eventually reaches our eyes has either been reflected or stripped of certain wavelengths by whatever it encountered on its journey. \nFor example, a patch of fresh snow reflects all of the sun\u2019s wavelengths uniformly (all visible wavelengths) and appears white to our eyes. A piece of coal uniformly absorbs most of the sunlight to strike it, so we see coal as black. And when sunlight strikes a leaf, all of its wavelengths except those that we perceive as green are absorbed, while the green wavelengths bounce to our eyes. \nColor in the sky \nSince our atmosphere is not a vacuum, sunlight is changed simply by passing through the air. In an atmosphere without impurities (like dust, smoke, and water vapor), light would only interact with air molecules. In very simple terms, an air molecule will scatter any wavelength that\u2019s smaller than it is, so the shortest wavelengths are most easily scattered. This atmospheric scattering of incoming solar energy becomes a filter that catches the violet and blue wavelengths first, allowing the longer wavelengths to pass through and continue their journey to more distant eyes. \nWhen the sun is overhead, sunlight travels through a relatively small amount of atmosphere. The wavelengths that reach our eyes are the first to be scattered, the short violet and blue wavelengths, and our sky looks blue\u00a0(the sky appears more blue than violet because our eyes are more sensitive to blue light). \nOn the other hand, when the sun is on the horizon, the light that reaches our eyes has passed through much more atmosphere than it did when the sun was directly overhead. The shorter violet and blue wavelengths are long gone, bluing-up the sky for others on their way, and the only remaining wavelengths are the longer, less easily scattered, orange and red wavelengths. It\u2019s sunset! \nPollution dampens the atmosphere\u2019s filtering process, so contrary to popular belief, the best for a vivid sunset is clean, unpolluted air. That\u2019s because the molecules of most atmospheric impurities are much larger than air molecules. Rather than only scattering specific colors the way tiny air molecules do, larger molecules scatter much more completely\u2014in other words, instead of scattering only the blue and violet wavelengths, polluted air catches lots of orange and red too (and everything in between). \nAnyone who has blended a smoothie consisting of a variety of brightly colored ingredients (such as strawberries, blueberries, cantaloupe, and kale\u2014uh, yum?) knows the smoothie\u2019s color won\u2019t be nearly as vivid as any of its ingredients, not even close. Instead you\u2019ll end up with a brownish or grayish muck that at best might be slightly tinted with the color of the predominant ingredient. \nVerify this for yourself the next time a storm clears, check the color in the sky\u2014whether it\u2019s midday blue, or sunset red, it\u2019s easy to see how much more vivid the color is. And what\u2019s better known for its sunsets, Hawaii, where it rains almost daily, or Los Angeles, with its urban sprawl. \nAnother source of color at sunset has become all too familiar to Californians (and others in or near wildfire-prone states) is red-rubber-ball sunsets when a fire is nearby. A vivid sunset requires intense sunlight, the more intense the better. In a typical brilliant sunset, while the rest of the sky is filled with color, the sun itself is far too bright to photograph as anything but a white disk (without rendering the rest of the scene much too dark). But when sunlight has to battle its way through smoke particles, the total amount of light is significantly reduced. There\u2019s not enough scattered light of any wavelength to color the sky. But look straight at the sun\u2014it\u2019s so inherently bright that some of its longest wavelengths have battled their way to your retinas, turning the sun red while the rest of the sky is a murky brownish-gray. \nGetting the most from your sunset images \nAny time rain has cleared the atmosphere and the remaining clouds are mixed with sunlight, there\u2019s a good chance for vivid sunrise or sunset color. I have a few go-to locations near home, and at my frequently visited photo locations (Yosemite, Grand Canyon, Death Valley, Hawaii, and so on) that I beeline to when the conditions for color in the sky look promising. \nAs I prepare my shot shortly before the sunset show begins, I look for clouds receiving direct sunlight. This is the light that will most likely color up at sunset, starting with an amber glow that transitions to pink, and red. Conversely, if no clouds are getting light shortly before sunset, that may be an indication that the sunset will fizzle. But don\u2019t go home\u2014some of the best sunsets I\u2019ve ever seen have happened when the sun slipped through an unseen hole in the clouds just below the horizon. \nA couple of frequent mistakes made by inexperienced photographers make is to give up on sunset too soon, and to forget to check the sky behind them. Shortly after the sun sets, the pink vestiges of the longest wavelengths still color the eastern horizon. As this color deepens, the steely blue of the Earth\u2019s shadow starts to descend. This combination of rich color and soft, shadowless light creates some of the best color and light for photography. Even when the scene appears too dark to your eye, don\u2019t forget that your camera can accumulate light and bring out detail lost to your eye. \nMaximizing color in the high dynamic range conditions of a sunset requires careful exposure. Rather than trusting the preview image on your scenes of such extreme contrast, it\u2019s important to trust your histogram. If the histogram for a high dynamic range scene like a sunset looks good (highlight and shadows not clipped), it\u2019s likely that on the LCD the highlights will look too bright, and the shadows too dark. Resist the urge to fix one or the other and trust that you\u2019ll be able to recover both in processing later. \nAnd don\u2019t forget to check your RGB histogram\u2014even if the luminosity histogram looks good, it\u2019s possible that the red channel is clipped and you\u2019ll need to reduce your exposure a little. \nAbout this image \nIt was January 2015 and I had only recently made the switch from Canon DSLR to Sony Alpha mirrorless. With fewer than 1000 frames shot on my new Sony a7R, I was already blown away by its dynamic range compared to my Canon 5DIII and was anxious for opportunities to reap its benefits. \nOn this winter evening I ended up in the foothills south and east of Sacramento, my go-to photo location closest to home. I have a number of spots here, each highlighted by one or more oak trees atop a west-facing hill that gives me great silhouette opportunities from the back side. \nRather than return to one of my tried and true spots, I wanted to find something new. I was alarmed at all the development underway in this once pastoral area, but I was able to get to this spot because a new road had been carved into the hills behind it. Construction had already begun and while it\u2019s illegal in California to cut down our beautiful oaks, it seems that they can develop right up to them and it wouldn\u2019t be long before this trio was completely surrounded by homes. It was pretty\u00a0clear that this shot wouldn\u2019t be possible if I were to return in even just a few weeks. \nAs you can see here, I once again confirmed the dynamic range of my new Sony sensor. The other thing I remember being excited about was the extra resolution. My longest lens at the time was the Sony 70-200 f/4 and I wanted to shoot this tighter. I just shot it at 200mm, but found that I had plenty of resolution to crop it down to what you see here. \nWorkshop Schedule\u00a0||\u00a0Purchase Prints\u00a0||\u00a0Instagram\n\nFoothill Oaks\nClick an image for a closer look, and a\u00a0slide show.\u00a0 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img width=\"150\" height=\"100\" src=\"https://eloquentnature.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/m7c8594oaksandcrescent2_blog.jpg?w=150&h=100\" class=\"attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://eloquentnature.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/m7c8594oaksandcrescent2_blog.jpg?w=150 150w, https://eloquentnature.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/m7c8594oaksandcrescent2_blog.jpg?w=300 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" data-attachment-id=\"6321\" data-permalink=\"https://garyhartblog.com/2013/07/12/one-part-plan-one-part-serendipity-one-part-impulse/_m7c8594oaksandcrescent2_blog/\" data-orig-file=\"https://eloquentnature.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/m7c8594oaksandcrescent2_blog.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"800,533\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{\"aperture\":\"11\",\"credit\":\"Gary M.

                "text": "We who believe in Freedom cannot rest.\u00a0\u00a0I believe that, but sometimes I just get tired.\u00a0\u00a0This last year has been hard in so many ways.\u00a0\u00a0The last four years have been hard as we watched the arc of the universe bend away from justice, especially in this country.\u00a0\u00a0For the last year we have been dealing with a deadly virus made worse by the incompetence of our national leadership. We have been sick ourselves, we have lost loved ones, many have lost their jobs and we have all suffered from the physical separation from our friends, our family and our church community. \n\n\n\nDo I even have to mention the last two weeks where we witnessed a right wing insurrection and an attempted coup.\u00a0\u00a0Hopefully the two pandemics of the corona virus and increased racism will soon be over.\u00a0\u00a0There are only 3 more days to a saner less vicious leader for this country.\u00a0\u00a0They will be 3 days filled with the fear and perhaps the reality of more violence and attacks on our democracy. I know and you know that even after Tuesday, we still cannot rest.\u00a0\u00a0Freedom has not yet come.\u00a0\u00a0It will continue to be the struggle it has always been.\u00a0\u00a0I am really tired and I want to rest.\u00a0\u00a0I want the nightmare over for once and for all. \n\n\n\nToday we are celebrating the life and leadership of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King.\u00a0\u00a0He was a visionary man, strong in his belief in freedom, in a dream of a better world, in his faith in God and in the belief that the moral arc of the universe really does bend toward justice.\u00a0\u00a0But King got tired too.\u00a0\u00a0He despaired.\u00a0He likely wanted to quit.\u00a0\u00a0He was in despair in Montgomery, Alabama before the children stood up and led the people to a victory against segregation in that city.\u00a0\u00a0The adults were all afraid of Bull Conner and his dogs and clubs.\u00a0\u00a0But the children wanted to demonstrate, and King struggled with whether to let them do so. It was their freedom they were fighting for, however, so he said yes, despite his fears for them.\u00a0\u00a0Over a thousand children went to jail before it was done and the images of their peaceful demonstrations being disrupted by dogs and firehoses helped turn the tide of public opinion and eventually end legal segregation. The images from January 6th\u00a0of this year I hope have had a similar impact. The veil that has often covered this country\u2019s endemic white supremacy has been lifted once again. \n\n\n\nBut back to despair.\u00a0\u00a0Our prelude this morning, Precious Lord, was King\u2019s favorite song. Given the challenges he faced, knowing he was likely to be assassinated before his dream was realized, it is no wonder he found comfort in that old hymn.\u00a0\u00a0It is both a cry for help and a statement of faith that there is a hand, a love that will not let us go. There is hope to be found even in times of the deepest despair. \u201cI am tired, I am weak, I am worn.\u201d\u00a0 \n\n\n\nI can sing those words myself with real feeling because I have felt that way. I suspect many of you have felt that way as well.\u00a0\u00a0We have all been through the storm, through the night, and we yearn to be led into the light, to peace, to calm, to the feeling that we have come home.\u00a0 \n\n\n\nHow do we leave the nightmare we have been living and dare to dream again?\u00a0\u00a0King did it.\u00a0\u00a0Can we?\u00a0\u00a0Part of the answer to is hold onto hope. \n\n\n\nLangston Hughes, an African American poet who was part of the Harlem Renaissance and also a gay man, had this to say about dreams: \n\n\n\nHold fast to dreams \n\n\n\nFor if dreams die \n\n\n\nLife is a broken-winged bird \n\n\n\nThat cannot fly. \n\n\n\nHold fast to dreams \n\n\n\nFor when dreams go \n\n\n\nLife is a barren field \n\n\n\nFrozen with snow. \n\n\n\nWe cannot let our dreams die, no matter how long or how hard we have to work to make them real.\u00a0\u00a0 \n\n\n\nA song we did not sing today is hymn #149 in the grey hymnal.(remember hymnals?) Often called the Negro National Anthem, it is being sung this morning in most African American Churches and many of our Unitarian Universalist congregations as well.\u00a0\u00a0It is a song of hope, but it also names the real despair, the awful hard times.\u00a0\u00a0The second verse in particular, \u201cstony the road we trod, bitter the chastening rod, felt in the days when hope unborn had died, yet with a steady beat, have not our weary feet come to the place for which our fathers sighed. We have come over a way that with tears have been watered, we have come treading our path through the blood of the slaughtered.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0That verse references both slavery and the civil war and the aftermath, yet ends with a vision of a bright star of hope. \n\n\n\nFaith can help us when we are in despair, so tired it feels like we can\u2019t go on. King said, \u201cWith this faith we will be able to hew out of the mountain of despair, a stone of hope.\u201d\u00a0 \n\n\n\nFaith can be a tricky concept for some Unitarian Universalists.\u00a0\u00a0I think we need some type of faith, however, to allow us to find and use what power we have even in the midst of heartbreak and despair.\u00a0 \n\n\n\nThe Rev. Dr. King was not a Unitarian Universalist, although he and his wife did attend one of our churches for a time.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \n\n\n\nIt was not an accident, however, that there were more Unitarian Universalist ministers involved with him in the civil rights struggle than from any other predominantly white denomination.\u00a0 \n\n\n\nSome of them gave their lives, most notably the Rev. James Rheeb, who died after being beaten by a gang of white segregationists.\u00a0 \n\n\n\nOur faith tradition is one that lives in this world. If we had a Holy Trinity in this faith of ours, it would be Justice, Love, and Compassion.\u00a0 \n\n\n\nDr. King always tried to live his life guided by love.\u00a0\u00a0He was a visionary, an activist for justice, but most of all; he was a man of faith that believed in love.\u00a0\u00a0 \n\n\n\nHe stood tall and he walked proud.\u00a0\u00a0 \n\n\n\nHe faced dogs and fire hoses, and finally an assassin\u2019s bullet, but he never lost sight of love.\u00a0\u00a0He reached out to both his enemies and to those that hung back on the sidelines.\u00a0\u00a0 \n\n\n\nNear the end of his life he also worked to end the Viet Nam war and he worked to end poverty.\u00a0\u00a0His life was not about a single issue.\u00a0 \n\n\n\nOur faith gives us so much, a welcoming place, a place where we can feel accepted, where we can be free to be who we are, where we can follow both our heads and our hearts, where we can find a place to be whole.\u00a0\u00a0But our faith also is a demanding one, one that asks us repeatedly to keep learning and growing, and doing.\u00a0\u00a0It isn\u2019t easy to walk our talk.\u00a0\u00a0It isn\u2019t easy to live according to our values. \n\n\n\nUnitarian Universalists worked to abolish slavery in this country.\u00a0\u00a0We worked for child labor laws, and for women\u2019s rights.\u00a0\u00a0Many of us marched with Dr. King.\u00a0 \n\n\n\nWe have been in the front lines in the struggle for full equality for gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender people.\u00a0\u00a0We are involved in immigrant rights and the Black Lives Matter movement.\u00a0 \n\n\n\nBut action can be risky.\u00a0\u00a0James Reeb and Martin Luther King were both murdered. Many others have also lost their lives in similar ways.\u00a0\u00a0But what is most important is not how they died, but how they lived.\u00a0 \n\n\n\nWe don\u2019t have to be a James Rheeb, or a Martin Luther King to follow in their footsteps, to keep their dreams alive.\u00a0\u00a0Not just their dreams, but also our own dreams, and the dreams of our children and all who will come after them.\u00a0 \n\n\n\nI want tell you some of what MLK said in a speech he gave, at our Unitarian Universalist General Assembly in 1966.\u00a0\u00a0It wasn\u2019t one of his most famous speeches and it isn\u2019t quoted often, but it was addressed directly to Unitarian Universalists and can, I think, speak to us today.\u00a0 \n\n\n\nDr King told us that the church needs to stay awake and be responsive to what is going on in the world.\u00a0 \n\n\n\n\u201cCertainly the church has a great responsibility\u201d he said, \u201cbecause when the church is true to its nature, it stands as a moral guardian of the community and of society.\u00a0 \n\n\n\n\u201cIt has always been the role of the church to broaden horizons, to challenge the status quo, and to question and break mores if necessary.\u201d \n\n\n\n\u201cIt is not enough for the church to work in the ideological realm, and to clear up misguided ideas. To remain awake through this social revolution, the church must engage in strong action programs\u201d\u00a0\u00a0 \n\n\n\nMLK changed hearts and minds.\u00a0\u00a0He changed the world.\u00a0\u00a0But he didn\u2019t do it alone.\u00a0\u00a0Thousands marched with him, thousands went to jail, and many were killed, as he was, by violence.\u00a0\u00a0 \n\n\n\nMartin Luther King did the eulogy for James Rheeb, and in that eulogy he spoke of hope, saying he was not discouraged by the future, despite the heartache, despite the tragedy that was all around him. \n\n\n\nHe faced despair, a whole mountain of it.\u00a0\u00a0A system of segregation that many believed would never really change.\u00a0\u00a0But in his dream he climbed that mountain of despair and saw a vision of the other side.\u00a0\u00a0He carved a stone of hope from that mountain, one that kept his dream alive.\u00a0\u00a0 \n\n\n\nMany of us are in despair today.\u00a0\u00a0We are in despair over the state of the world, the wars, the impending environmental disasters, the racism; the massive scale of human suffering that exists all around the world.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \n\n\n\nSome of us may also be in despair over something that is going on in our own individual lives, a relationship gone bad, a health crises, a job loss, a need for housing, or for even a little bit of financial security.\u00a0 \n\n\n\nWe need to keep dreaming.\u00a0\u00a0We need to keep doing, to keep on working, making the effort, and keep taking the risks.\u00a0\u00a0The largest problem can be tackled, step-by-step and piece-by-piece.\u00a0\u00a0Work for justice.\u00a0\u00a0Do your part to help heal the planet.\u00a0\u00a0Ask for help when you need it.\u00a0\u00a0Dare to keep on dreaming. If we keep dreaming together we can make those dreams, those visions of a better world, of a better life; we can make those dreams come true.\u00a0 \n\n\n\nI will end with these words by MLK \n\n\n\n\u201cWhen our days become dreary with low-hovering clouds of despair, and when our nights become darker than a thousand midnights, let us remember that there is a creative force in this universe, working to pull down the gigantic mountains of evil, a power that is able to make a way out of no way and transform dark yesterdays into bright tomorrows. Let us realize the arc of the moral universe is long but it bends toward justice.\u201d \n\n\n\nWe are part of that creative force that will find a way to keep bending that arc toward justice.\u00a0\u00a0May it be so.\u00a0 \n\n\n\nBenediction: \n\n\n\nHold fast to your dreams.\u00a0\u00a0Shine the light of truth bright enough to scare the nightmares away.\u00a0\u00a0Keep the faith, the one that will set us free.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Amen and blessed be.",

The snow falls, covering the ground, and for all of us inside, it seems to be a peaceful day. We know differently though. The wind whips around, the ice makes it dangerous for travel, and no one would want to be trapped outside in this. It's a couple of days after the attack on our Capitol and I'm still trying to make sense of it all. I sit in my house sipping on a cold refreshing beer, while a fire warms the house and my girls play with their magnetic tiles. I realize that not much has changed about my day-to-day life. I go to work, my kids play, my wife and I discuss life, current events, local news, the days ahead, and how to continue to protect ourselves from COVID. Yet, a nagging feeling sits in the pit of my stomach. We fundamentally changed the course of our country on January 6th. Domestic terrorism did not become a unifying cry for unity. It became wrapped up in political grandstanding, injected with conspiracy theories, as it all unfolded and somehow passed as a specific event in our culture. It's not typical; well, I at least cling to my sanity, hoping it's not an everyday event in our society. This is not a culture I want to raise children in\u2014a culture where a small percentage is willing to worship a dishonest and small-minded man as some sort of god. Then we act as if this small percentage is the majority of our country. Yes, the number of people who voted for Trump is more than those at the Capitol. But I can't believe all of Trump's voters wanted what occurred at the Capital to happen. If I start thinking that way, I will have lost all faith in humanity. I wonder why kids in cages didn't cause them to break from Trump? Why didn't asking for foreign interference in our election have them break from Trump? Why does fear of higher taxes and increased government involvement scare them more than the overthrow of democracy?\u00a0 When did our neighbors and family members become the enemy? It's these types of questions we have to answer moving forward because there is no end in sight for this storm. We have entered into a new reality; while we might feel safe miles from the eye of the storm, it will soon reach our doors if we do not change course. It's easy to go down the laundry list of usual suspects: the media, the political party you don't vote for, globalization, the speed of the news cycle, the apathy toward the poor, the worshiping of money, and whatever vague problem we scream into your echo chambers. As the storm rages, we have to wonder what our world will look like when it clears. Will we assist our fellow neighbors with all the debris we need to pick up? Will we realize discussing these challenging subjects with people outside our echo chambers matters? Will we recognize that it seems to be the minority driving the narratives in our culture? As we figure out how to pass the time as this storm rages, we must ask ourselves, what will we do when the sun shines again? A storm is destructive, but sometimes destruction is needed to make way for a better way forward. I just hope there is a world left to help when this storm stops raging!",

Make sure you take care of social obligations earlier in the week when the energy is available. The start of the week brings an immediate shift in the cosmic energy as the Sun moves out of Capricorn and into Aquarius. Aquarius energy is great to use if you need to make dynamic changes in your life. If there are areas of your life that need repair, then Aquarius season is a great time to work on them. \n\n\n\nLater in the week, Mars is going to conjoin Uranus and square Jupiter bringing the Jupiter-Uranus energy that\u2019s been around all month back on stage again. Since this energy is Mars influenced, and with Jupiter Uranus already an impulsive aspect, you need to think things through before acting. Moreover, Mars conjunct Uranus is accident prone so proceed with caution, and perhaps wear a hard hat. \n\n\n\nThis weekend the Sun makes its yearly conjunction with Saturn. Sun-Saturn is great for personal advancement and taking care of your responsibilities, but don\u2019t expect fun and games this weekend because completing tasks may supersede personal enjoyment. \n\n\n\nBest Coventry candles for this week are Blessed Herbal Problem Solver, Protection, and Stability, and Wicked Witch Mojo Wishin\u2019 Mojo. \n\n\n\n)0( \n\n\n\nRuby\u2019s Astro Readings http://rubysreadings.com \n\n\n\nSUN ENTERS AQUARIUS \n\n\n\nJanuary 19 \u2013 February 18 \n\n\n\nThe Sun shifts into inquisitive Aquarius on January 19th, 2021. \n\n\n\nHappy Birthday to all my Aquarius peeps, and welcome to AQUARIUS SEASON, everyone! \n\n\n\nThis month-long cycle keeps us hungry for knowledge and experience. There\u2019s a stronger urge to mingle once again, so we search for new ways of doing things and for what\u2019s original, different, or unique. It\u2019s a time of self-expression, as our thoughts and actions both drive our ambitions. \n\n\n\nDuring this time, we can become increasingly aware of what is no longer working in our lives and can strive to find what will, as we\u2019re open to learning fresh new perspectives. After all, Aquarius is the Zodiac\u2019s humanitarian, so we can feel pulled to like-minded people and groups to help them get what they rightfully deserve. \n\n\n\nUnder the Sun in Aquarius, we can feel artistic, friendly, and social. So our general attitude about life is more peaceful but also concerned. We can be quite detached emotionally simply because we want to take care of business. This energy can be nerve-wracking for some and cause high anxiety, especially if we focus on what\u2019s lacking. Turn this worrisome energy into something you can manifest by setting goals and plans for the future. Tackle one thing at a time and prepare yourself. Concentrate on helping others because being detached from our emotions helps us put our feelings aside just long enough to take care of business. \n\n\n\nNow that it\u2019s officially Aquarius Season we as individuals will seek more independence and freedom. The status quo doesn\u2019t satisfy. Especially, with so many other planets in this sign like Saturn, Jupiter and recently mental Mercury. We\u2019re going to work very hard now to free ourselves from any restrictions, limitations, and inhibitions that keep us feeling blocked or constrained. \n\n\n\nWe\u2019re still in the battle against Covid, so we must lockdown and stay in place if we like it or not, life is different for all of us, and we aren\u2019t able to be as social as we used to be. These limitations don\u2019t sit well with us, and people feel quite irritated, especially under all this Aquarius energy because we have a deeper need to be free and alive! The shadow side of Aquarius is rebellion and possible revolution, and that\u2019s already begun here in the US! It\u2019s important to get out of our comfort zones and look into the furthest parts of our minds for answers and more peaceful resolutions! \n\n\n\nThere\u2019s a lot of movement and excitement, usually during Aquarius Season, along with brilliant ideas and discoveries! We tend to be more open-minded so we can experience more awareness and knowingness. And there are some seriously important A-Ha moments and epiphanies. We can experience strokes of genius, as we\u2019re flooded with information during this time. Taking notes and journal writing can be quite telling during this cycle. \n\n\n\nWith the Sun in Aquarius, we are better at expressing ourselves more openly. To flow better with this energy, we should try new ways of communicating and expressing ourselves. Areas of study that involve science, technology, and metaphysics can go extremely well. New Age is in, now that we are actually in the \u201cAge of Aquarius,\u201d as we are more attracted to the unusual, bizarre, or just something different. \n\n\n\nConventional or traditional values are changed up during this time, with fresh and exciting horizons ahead, we are motivated by spirit. Now with mental Mercury also in the sign of Aquarius and the Sun, we get the chance to stretch our minds, bodies, and spirits. Explore the possibilities safely! \n\n\n\nStay Safe & Be Well ~Ruby \n\n\n\n)0( Biddy Tarot http://www.biddytarot.com \n\n\n\nCard of the Week: Queen of Wands \n\n\n\nAre you feeling upbeat, courageous, and determined this week?

Over time, altars become attuned to the energies that are worked with them. When erecting an altar, we should ideally be in tune with our creative process to allow divine inspiration to guide us. This is a simple spell to help you align with that inspiration to further empower and awaken your altar space. \n\n\n\nYou will need a small piece of paper and a pen. Ground and center. Concentrate on the purpose of your altar. On the paper, draw a pentagram, and in the center of it, draw an open eye. Chant over it three times: \n\n\n\nAwaken unto life and be A place to reach between the worlds. \n\n\n\nTake a deep breath of power and then exhale over the paper, \u201cseeing\u201d the symbols shine.

A great solution is to set smaller goals over the course of the entire year that add up to big changes come December. The new moon is an ideal time to set intentions. As the moon grows in the sky, so does your motivation! \n\n\n\nThink about what big change you want to make by the end of the year, and break it into twelve stages.

If you cannot collect the first snow, do not despair: this spell can be used with snow during the entire winter season. If it doesn\u2019t snow where you live, gather raindrops in a clear glass container during the first full moon of the year (which will be on January 28, 2021). \n\n\n\nAfter you collect the snow, place it in a bowl with the items you want to cleanse.

One Saturday I watched him prepare for his task. He began by scowling and muttering under his breath. He continued by stomping his feet as he muttered. He appeared to be getting angry. I was about to ask him what was the matter when he went off, got the vacuum and plugged it in. \n\n\n\nSoon he was slamming the length of the long wand around the furniture. He continued to mutter and to appear angry. The cats fled his wrath and I decided to get something done in the kitchen. Eventually he put the vacuum away and went whistling cheerfully out the back door. When I had the opportunity, I asked him what he had been angry about. He grinned at me and said, \u201cNothing.\u201d He then went on to explain that he hated vacuuming, and that was how he worked himself up to get the chore done. \n\n\n\nI thought about this recently as I was putting the clean pillow cases onto our bed pillows. I laid one on the bed, smoothed out the wrinkles and began to insert the end of a pillow into the case. As usual, this wasn\u2019t easy to do and I had to go at it slowly and carefully in order to make any progress. Finally, though it seemed to take a lot of time, I managed to get all my pillows into their cases. As I did this, I thought about the choice I had between doing my small chore with resentment or doing it with love. Because I figured it would feel better than resentment, I decided on love. \n\n\n\nThe attitude with which a task is done is actually quite important. It can help to make a task go more quickly as well as more efficiently. I\u2019ve noticed that when I act with impatience, I often make foolish errors or mess things up and have to go back to fix them. When I focus my mind on seeing what I do as an act of love, and most especially when I project a sense of love and satisfaction into the doing of it, the results are much better. It is not always easy to catch oneself in the act, so to speak, and it does require a sense of mindfulness. However, with practice it is quite possible to think of the small chores one does as a labor of love, and to give that to one\u2019s loved ones. \n\n\n\nMay your chores go smoothly and your heart feel warm as you do them. \n\n\n\nBlessings and Best Regards, Tasha Halpert \n\n\n\nPS How do you handle doing what you\u2019d rather not be doing while you are doing it?

Parker \n\n\n\nWicca is a very personalized belief and one which varies from person to person. Wicca is associated with witchcraft but is usually considered to be beneficial or positive witchcraft. In Wicca, there isn\u2019t a single right answer. The person searching for an appropriate path should practice the witchcraft that feels most correct to them. The practice of Wicca is as denominational as Christianity is. There are several major forms of Wicca, and the searcher may require a while to find the one which is the best fit for them personally. \n\n\n\nThe Celtic pantheon or circle of gods is one of the major branches of Wicca. The searcher may choose to join with these groups, while another may choose to join with the Stregheria rituals. Similar to the Celtic pantheon is that of the Druids. Another Wicca major tradition is that of Asatru. The Gardnerian Wiccans follow the teachings of Gardner. An Eclectic Wiccan includes components from many different groups and makes them uniquely their own. \n\n\n\nThose Wiccans who are searching for the right branch of witchcraft can be searching for many months and perhaps it will take years. \n\n\n\nDon\u2019t be concerned if you are unable to find a good fit in a short time. Eventually, you will hope to find one which feels more personal to you than the other paths. This is the one which will guide you into a better understanding, not only of yourself but above all of the steps which you are about to follow. \n\n\n\nIn Wicca, there is no \u201cone right answer\u201d. It is more about how you feel. If you prefer a Book of Shadows with lined paper, then that\u2019s great, but don\u2019t be hard on yourself if you\u2019re doing something a little differently than some other Wiccans you might know. If you prefer a wand over an athame, that\u2019s perfectly fine too. Everyone is different. The path of the Wiccan is a personal path. That is one of the many wonders of Wicca. \n\n\n\nWitches \n\n\n\nAt the same time as it is a tradition going back into the mists of history, witchcraft is changing constantly because it is a reflection of those who practice it. There is no central holy book or one rule book to provide guidance to those who are witches. Witchcraft is a balanced spirituality which develops both communications with the whole of nature and prayerful oneness with the gods. A witch can always find room to develop and lessons to be learned. Witchcraft is a constant searching for fresh insight and deepening personal practices of witchcraft. \n\n\n\nMost witches believe that daily observation is important to deepen spirituality. The goal is not to inform but to transform, daily observation helps to ground one in the presence of the interconnected and vibrant universe. Daily celebrations of Nature\u2019s cycle will lead to a better understanding of one\u2019s place in the big picture. \n\n\n\nOften, witches will start and end the day with a greeting to each element and direction and to the gods. Those who prefer ceremonial observations may recite the Lesser Banishing Ritual. Gardnerian Wiccans may choose to proclaim the Charge of the Goddess. \n\n\n\nWitchcraft today is made up of many traditions. Witches believe that the practice of their craft is just one of many paths and including the use of myth, symbolism, and ritual in the daily celebration helps to understand the composition of the magickal universe. Studying about other paths such as Islam, Santeria or Hinduism at a level that will allow one to experience the benefits of the other path will add richness and emphasis to your own walk. Another experience may work better for you than does witchcraft. \n\n\n\nWitchcraft and Occult Practices \n\n\n\nFor hundreds of years, society has viewed witchcraft and occult practices as dark and sinister territory. Magickal practices and those who use them are considered to be associated with the negative connotations of life. \n\n\n\nThose who practice witchcraft are considered to have a large collection of supernatural abilities such as levitation, clairvoyance, and telekinesis. or those whose essence comes from dusty and shadowy tomes of written mysteries. However, it should be noted that witches are also students of nature and claim nature as a teacher and educator. \n\n\n\nNature exists as the essence of everything that is outside human changes and interference. It\u2019s not just the earth below and the blue sky overhead; it is all that is in between and yet more. Each being or entity that is part of this network of change is a unique existence of naked power which contains within itself a spiritual connection which binds all things together. The tree is bound to the sea which is bound to a field, which is bound to a river. Each of these entities and places expresses the quality which is inherently magical and imbues everything with a natural glow. Witches use witchcraft to become one with and be empowered by nature. \n\n\n\nIn essence, witchcraft can be defined as the ability to reach a goal or grasp onto a wish by artful channeling and manipulation of vital energy. The source of the vital energy can be almost any part of the natural landscape which provides inspiration, such as the moon, the sun, or the oak tree. \n\n\n\nBoth witches and those who oppose them have a pattern of connecting witchcraft with various elemental forces of nature. Many of the ancient tribes and clans recognized encounters with wild animals in their totems. This is particularly noted in the native American tribes and in the clans of the Celts. \n\n\n\nA witch focuses efforts toward a delicate connection with all natural surroundings and can become attuned to various levels of knowledge which is a part of the natural kingdom. The ancient confidence in multiple spirits and the movement of these spirits between bodies is the basis of Animism which is the ancestor of the spirituality of the shamans which was prevalent in the prehistoric peoples. This ensuing world view probably forms the basis of the science and art commonly called witchcraft. \n\n\n\nAny dedicated gardener will assure you that talking to your plants or singing to them will help them to grow more quickly and with greater strength. Speaking to plants is based in Animism and the desire to return to that connection with nature. Witchcraft recognizes that the core of Nature is that all life is connected and each person and creature is a part of the connection. This is true of each action taken and the pattern we fulfill. \n\n\n\nThe witch is one who recognizes that energy is without ending or beginning. This belief is fundamental to the practice of witchcraft. Energy can be channeled but cannot be created or destroyed forever. \n\n\n\nWitchcraft over the History \n\n\n\nWitchcraft of one kind or another has been known in many if not most societies for thousands of years. Over the ages of history, witches have also been known as healers, gods, teachers, historians, priests and priestesses, and shamans. Other people such as Paracelsus the Swiss physician, Virgil, the Roman poet and Pythagoras, the Greek philosopher were believed, sometimes correctly to be witches. In Western culture, the debilitating fear of witches can be traced to the beginnings of persecution in the 1400s when they were first persecuted in Europe. \n\n\n\nWitches and those who practice witchcraft have historically been considered people who make magic. People who change or influence events through superstitious beliefs and practices, nature, and folklore are known as witches. \n\n\n\nIn Europe, although many of the ancient pagan religions which included those with practices including magic spells and other practices were strong, Christianity became the dominant religion. The Christian church, believing that magic practices along with no worship of God as seen by the Jewish and Christians, associated the practices of witchcraft and by extension witches with the devil. For over 300 years, even the mere suspicion of witchcraft was enough to result in torture, brutality, and execution of hundreds of thousands of people. In most cases, as seen in the 17th-century witch trials which occurred in Salem Massachusetts the evidence was faked, obtained through torture and often false. \n\n\n\nOften, older women who were widowed or unmarried and lived alone or which only small animals as pets were targeted for the accusation of witchcraft. These women sometimes owned desirable land which was taken from them. Other times they were criticized for their use of plants and herbal remedies along with traditions from folklore in order to heal. Finally, the women often were poor and so made easy targets to the attackers. \n\n\n\nToday, witchcraft exists in many cultures and societies. There was no systematic effort to eradicate witchcraft in Tibet, Thailand, Brazil, India or other countries where it is still respected and practiced. In Africa, witch doctors are numerous who ask ancestors for assistance, heal those who are ill, foretell what will occur in the future and cast spells. \n\n\n\nIn Tibet, a ritual dance by the Buddhist monks portrays an evil spirit from times which predate Buddhist beliefs includes a Tibetan Buddhist priest. The dance is an attempt to drive out evil. \n\n\n\nThe shamans of Sri Lanka treat maladies by the restoration of energy balance within the body. \n\n\n\nThe magical art of feng-shui was developed by ancient Chinese cultures and has become most popular in the West, particularly in America. \n\n\n\nThe best known and most widely practiced type of witchcraft in the West, particularly in the United States is Wicca. It is believed that there are somewhere between four hundred thousand and three million practitioners of witchcraft in the United States. Adherents to Wicca, the most common form of witchcraft call themselves Wiccans or witches. There is an active battle going on right now for acceptance and tolerance for their beliefs. It is believed that Wicca is the religion which is growing most rapidly in the country. \n\n\n\nIn addition, other popular magical beliefs which may be closely tied together including New Ageism and astrology, aromatherapy are enjoying a strong revival, as are herbalism and alternative medicine. Wicca and Modern WitchcraftImage by RD LH from Pixabay Types of Witchcraft \n\n\n\nWitchcraft is practiced by four different types of witches in popular Western viewpoints. \n\n\n\nThe satanic witch was tormented as a worshiper of the devil during the Spanish Inquisitions and also during the witch hunts in this country.  Evangelical Christians still categorize satanic cults in widespread distribution as being endemic to this country.\nThe second type of witch is the tribal witch.  This is the type of witch from the American Indian, Pacific Islander, and African Caribbean religions.  The tribal witch is the scapegoat of the benevolent healer and shaman. In South Africa and Java both.\nThe hideous hags in fairy tales such as The Wizard of Oz and Hansel and Gretal are the third type of those who practice witchcraft.\nThe final kind of witches and witchcraft is the neo-pagan, which includes those who are known as Wiccans. Wiccans trace their roots to pre-Christian history and to the Druidism of the Celts.  There is no connection with Satanic witchcraft, in fact, Wiccans don\u2019t believe in Satan or the Judeo-Christian God, but in a female goddess of all natural things.\n\n\n\nWiccans believe in spirit communication, psychokinesis and other psychic ability such as clairvoyance. Feminists grab hold of the tenets of Wicca in order to emphasize self-empowerment, female spiritual leaders and matriarchal deity. \n\n\n\nHollywood and other media forms have embraced the rich lore of Wicca and of connected witchcraft in a number of magazine works, films, and books. Practical Magic with Sandra Bullock and Nicole Kidman, the ABC sitcom Sabrina the Teenage Witch, Charmed on WB Network. Book sales both fiction and nonfiction dealing with the subject of witchcraft have soared. Witchcraft and Magick \n\n\n\nIn order to successfully practice witchcraft and to bend the force of magick effectively, the witch must draw a sacred breath. This is to remove the mind from its distractions where thoughts are tossed about like leaves on the wind with no anchor. The clouds of stress burden even further so that there is no relief sensed or even hoped for. In order to overcome these fogs and mists, one must focus on the breath of fresh air which is the reconnection with the accessible elements of nature. This fresh air is taken in by the body, providing fuel to the lungs, the heartbeat to continue and the energizing of the entire body. Particularly in the morning, this breath activates and directs the essential four elements of Earth, Air, Water, and Fire and begins the magick. (?f you want to read more about. Try these articles, \u201cMagick \u2013 Definition and Etymology\u201d and \u201cThe Four Elements Throughout Mystic Tradition\u201d.) \n\n\n\nThe witchcraft magick directed by the witch in the center of a circle focuses and conducts energy that is the basis of life and youthfulness itself. Nature doesn\u2019t need to be begged only returned to health and vitality after the patriarchal institutions of the human race who have ravaged the Earth Mother Gaia in the quest for dividing the material and the spiritual, the sacred from the profane. \n\n\n\nThis separation from the Mother is the cause of distress, confusion and searching for answers. Witchcraft magick recognizes the return to the Earth rather than expecting salvation to come from the heavens. As Gaia is more devastated, she grows less patient, but at the same time welcomes the art of witchcraft from those faithful who refuse to be absorbed into the maelstrom of superiority, conservatism, globalism, and consumerism. \n\n\n\nWitchcraft magick is frequently castigated because it is proud and self-possessed in its refusal to be forced into molds. The witches recognize a world order that is soul-based, not mind-based. The free spirits that dance upon the wind, roam the plains freely and wander in the forest glades with only the light from the moon. \n\n\n\nWitches ask only that from Mother Earth, Gaia which she has freely offered. She gives wisdom, happiness, wealth and health to all those who ask. The essence of witchcraft is the spirit of wholeness with nothing added. This essence is within everything as well as being everything. Its presence is a powerful answer to how we originated in omniscient consciousness which is all-encompassing. \n\n\n\nLife is both contractions and expansions, of the push and pulls between concurrence and synchronicity. Although recognizing that subtle interplay of the forces that direct all, one can only recognize that once the cards are dealt, the casting of the runes complete, the spell determined and the powers called, the heart of the matter is in the relationship with the vital energy flow known as magick. To remain focused on the energy flow contained in the squeezing and releasing is the duty of the witch. It is the directing and control of this elemental flow which provides a hint as to the nature of the witch and the nature of the witchcraft which is practiced. \n\n\n\nIf this article resonates with you, please join our newsletter by using the forms on this website so we can stay in touch. \n\n\n\n)0( \n\n\n\n5 Essential Magical Practices November 22, 2019 by Gwion Raven \n\n\n\nThere are hundreds of ways to practice magic. I\u2019m sure you have your favourites. I know I have mine. Over the years, and over many fine glasses of wine, I\u2019ve chatted with all manner of Witches and Pagans and Druids about what makes magic happen for them. While the style and substance may vary, these five essential magical practices appear on everyone\u2019s list. \n\n\n\nMagical Practice #1: Use What You Have \n\n\n\nI\u2019d love to practice magick in the gardens of an 800 year old manor estate somewhere in the Cotswolds. All my Pagan friends would come for the weekend. We\u2019d wile the day away discussing arcane magical lore, indulge in a veritable feast for the senses, gather in the rose garden under a full moon, make magic until the wee hours, and retire to our plush four-poster beds. Um\u2026Unlikely to happen any time soon. Until then, I\u2019ll practice in the living room, the local park, or in the ritual room my coven meets in. \n\n\n\nPracticing magic doesn\u2019t require the perfect location or the most expensive robes or the coolest tools. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I love the tools I\u2019ve collected, bought, borrowed, or been gifted over the years. They certainly get me in the mood to do magic, but I can do magic without them. In fact, most folk magic systems use every day items like candles and pins and sharpies and socks and old mason jars. Not Where I practice Magic. Oh! But wouldn\u2019t it be lovely. \n\n\n\nMagical Practice #2: Spend An Hour In Devotion \n\n\n\nIf part of your magic includes working with deities, set aside an hour, and be in devotion to them. Working with gods not your thing? Spend an hour devoted to your ancestors, or to your partner(s), or to tending your altar, or even yourself. Make devotion a priority. And that hour could be one sixty minute time slot or you might consider spending 8.57 minutes per day (that\u2019s an hour a week, broken down by day) in devotional practice. The key thing to remember is that devoting time to someone/something is all about them. You\u2019re not looking for a reward or even reciprocation. Devotion is a gift you give with no expectation. \n\n\n\nMagical Practice #3: Actually Do Magic \n\n\n\nFolks new to the Craft are always doing spells, gathering herbs, making charm bags, anything they can do or make that connects them to magic. After a few years of practice, it\u2019s not uncommon to forget to do magic. Or perhaps, to put it kindly, we get a little lazy. Instead of checking correspondences, erecting altars, or researching spells, we just sort of say \u201cSo mote it be\u201d and have done with it. The best part of magic is actually doing magic. I highly recommend having some sort of spell going all the time and actively working with it. Light the green candle on your money altar. Feed your charm bag. Cut pictures out of magazines of the places you want to go. Mix herbs and oils aligned with travel into the glue and paste everything onto construction paper. Whatever you do, actually do it. Part of a spell I\u2019ve been working for years \n\n\n\nMagical Practice #4: Talk About Magic \n\n\n\nAt least once a day, I talk about magic. Now, to be sure, it\u2019s pretty easy for me. I write about magic. I own a metaphysical shop. My Partner is a witch. Many of my friends are somehow connected to various Pagan communities. If that\u2019s not the reality for you, make it a practice to talk with someone, as regularly as you can, about magic. In person is great, and online works too. There are any number of places to chat about magic. Talking about magic could look like sharing a spell with someone or recounting a mystical experience or discussing that cool new kitchen witchery cookbook you just discovered. Whatever it is, make magic a regular part of your life. Notice I said \u201cregular\u201d part of your life, not \u201cmake magic an all consuming passion and bring up magic in every interaction you have with any human being ever\u201d. \n\n\n\nMagical Practice #5: Learn How To Ground \n\n\n\nThis is a big one. You\u2019d be surprised how many Pagan folk don\u2019t know how to do this magical practice. Basically, grounding means bringing yourself to the present moment. Ever have someone rush up to you after a ritual, they get right in your face, they bounce all over the place, and tell you all about their profound experiences with the Goddess, without ever realizing they\u2019re standing on your foot? Yep. That person, needs to ground. Grounding is a pretty simple practice. It can look a lot like breathing. Grounding might be about meditation for you. Lots of folks close their eyes when they ground, but I recommend keeping them open and staying connected to your environment and whomever you\u2019re sharing it with. I can\u2019t tell you how many teachers, high priestesses, magical presenters, and workshop leaders I\u2019ve talked to that swear by their regular, daily, grounding practice. \n\n\n\nThere you have it folks. Five essential magical practices you can start right now (or restart or continue doing). \n\n\n\n)0( \n\n\n\nA Candle Meditation To Calm Emotions BY GWYN \n\n\n\nIn the past week, I\u2019ve been feeling a lot of emotions. Thus, I have performed this candle meditation. Why? The events of the Capitol Insurrection and its aftermath have preoccupied my thoughts with a lot of anger. I\u2019ve got a lot of feels that need redirection from time to time. \n\n\n\nMy family and I have expressed the outrage we feel on our podcast (Episode 126 ). I\u2019m sick of people supporting Trump and his\u2026everything. News reports indicate a deeper threat to our government from Trump\u2019s supporters that could include members of Congress. And let\u2019s not forget we still have a PANDEMIC infecting and killing people every day. It\u2019s enough to make even the most sanguine of individuals a nervous wreck. \n\n\n\nTake A Moment To Focus Inspired by others, I\u2019ve encouraged people to care for themselves. Step away from the madness for a moment. Yes. There is a lot of information we need to know to be informed, stay safe, and make smart decisions. But it\u2019s even more important to take a breath, watch something else, talk about anything other than Trump, the Insurrection, Covid 19, etc. \n\n\n\nSo, as we move into next week\u2019s festivities (and many offer prayers, rituals, and spells of protection over the events) I offer a Candle Meditation. Just something easy to do when you need a chance to stop, breathe, and release or redirect the feels. And feel free to use it for any occasion. I\u2019ve made this basic and generic. Tailor it to your needs. \n\n\n\nCandle Meditation This meditation is easy and can be done at a moment\u2019s notice. If traveling, you can use a battery-operated candle if in a location where any kind of fire is not permitted. You can spend five minutes or however long you feel is necessary. If you are at home and want to add ambiance, play quiet music or nature sounds. Light some incense and dim the lights. \n\n\n\nNeeded: \n\n\n\nCandle (birthday, taper, spell, jar \u2014whatever works or you have on hand) I prefer white for meditation but any color will do. Matches or lighter Sit in a comfortable position. You can be in a chair with the candle on a table or sit on the floor with the candle in front of you. \n\n\n\nLight the candle. \n\n\n\nFor 5 Minute Meditation Take five deep breaths. You can use the technique I shared in my previous post. \n\n\n\nLook into the center of the flame. It\u2019s okay to blink your eyes as needed. \n\n\n\nBreathe normally. \n\n\n\nIf there is something that is not useful to you, release or allow it to diminish. Otherwise, exist within the moment. Allow your breathing to bring calmness. \n\n\n\nWhen ready, wiggle fingers and toes. Open your eyes and go on about your day. \n\n\n\nFor Longer Meditation As you do this, pay attention to how you are feeling in your body. Acknowledge discomfort if you cannot alleviate it by adjusting the position and move on. Take your time and be aware of your space. Sink into your body. Exist within the moment. \n\n\n\nTake five more deep breaths. \n\n\n\nObserve the flame and acknowledge it. \n\n\n\nExamine your feelings. Reflect on them. Is there anything that you need to embrace that will aid you? Can it be transformed into useful or helpful action? Is there anything you need to release? When you are ready, allow the flame to assist you with releasing or transforming. \n\n\n\nTake five more deep breaths. Return to normal breathing, exist within the moment allowing calmness to infuse your mind and body. \n\n\n\nWhen ready, wiggle fingers and toes. Open your eyes and go on about your day. \n\n\n\n)0( \n\n\n\nSulfur Quartz \u2013 Science & Origin of Sulfur Quartz \n\n\n\nSulfur Quartz is a common mineral that crystallizes in the form of masses, tiny prismatic crystals, large, pointed generators, scepters, and double terminated quartz configurations. Historically it\u2019s been referred to as \u201cBrimstone\u201d, due to the smell of rotting eggs when struck together. \n\n\n\nIts color can range from a light pale yellow, to a bold-defining gold that resembles rays of the sun. Although this mineral can be found throughout the world in places such as Canada, Japan, and the United States, the main commercialized deposits are coming out of Brazil. \n\n\n\nMeaning & Energy Sulfur Quartz resonates directly with one\u2019s personal will and helps reignite the inner emotions that drive us forward each day. A renewed growth cycle will begin to engage your body when tapping into this stone\u2019s energies. This newfound perspective of yourself and the world around you will help you see what it is you truly want. \n\n\n\nMany souls that are lost in the world have no vision of what they view as important and achievable. This leads people down a scary path full of sadness, monotony, and emotional carnage. One of the major defining factors of Sulfur Quartz is its passive ability to lead one\u2019s mind while providing hope for your emotional body and spirit. \n\n\n\nAllow your newly illuminated core to infuse with your own unique cognitive abilities. Remind oneself of the power you possess, and begin to display it through creating, manifesting, building, and driving forward each day. \n\n\n\nAmplify Your Desires Sulfur Quartz enables you to truly create your own path in this world while directing your full attention to achieving your goals and desires. As you begin working with this stone and become more comfortable with its vibrations, one must begin to channel their own energies into it. Grab a piece of Sulfur Quartz and begin placing your most desired intentions into it. This can be done through extreme mental focus or vocal repetitions. This is vital as it makes your dreams and desires physical and known to the universe. \n\n\n\nThe Quartz is an enhancing crystal and will strengthen this newly conjured energy, while channeling it directly towards your personal will. This allows one\u2019s body to become enchanted and strengthened, while maintaining a clear mind with laser sharp focus. Lastly, this crystal will provide you with reassurance that the journey you are on is the right one! \n\n\n\n)0( \n\n\n\nBlack Salt, White Salt, and Red Brick Dust All Over BY LILITH DORSEY \n\n\n\nThere are many traditional Hoodoo, Voodoo and magickal items that can be used for protection. White Sea Salt, Black Salt, and Red Brick dust are a few of these powerful tools. \n\n\n\nHoodoo Help with Red Brick Dust \n\n\n\nHoodoo practitioners put Red Brick Dust almost everywhere- the thresholds, the windowsills, the property line\u2026 anywhere that needs to be protected. The most effective dust comes from old houses or buildings. Someone gave me a bag full from an old Haunted House. It has it\u2019s own special mojo. There are several spiritual supply shops that will sell you a bag, or you can make your own from some crumbling bricks that are no longer needed. Just light a white candle, get out your mortar and pestle and ground them down into a fine powder. The red brick dust is said to create a powerful psychic barrier that nothing harmful can cross. For best results be sure to lay a complete line across all your thresholds and windowsills on the eve of the full moon. You can then replace this monthly or whenever you feel the need to reinforce your protection in the home. \n\n\n\nRub Salt in the Wound \n\n\n\nSea Salt has been used for protection and blessing for centuries. Some Pagans I know swear by salt from the Dead Sea, the lowest point on earth. All the local rivers flow to the Dead Sea, but nothing flows out. Salt can only be removed through evaporation. This is useful for healing magick, earth magick and protection blessings. Very often I recommend to clients who come to me for spellwork to use salt if they are having a problem with nightmares or unwanted energies in their home. Salt or Saltwater can be sprinkled under the bed and in the corners of the home for a subtle, yet highly effective blessing. I have a godsister who makes visitors stand in a litterbox full of sea salt that she has outside her front door. This makes sure everyone leaves their problems literally on the doorstep before entering her home. You can also make a circle out of sea salt to recharge your Tarot Cards or other ritual items. \n\n\n\nBlack Salt for Dark Nights \n\n\n\nMany protection formulas and spells also call for the use of Black Salt, also known as Black Salt powder. There are many different types of Black Salt, here I am referring to the ritual type, as opposed to the Indian salt used in cooking. Ritual Black Salt is usually made by combininng sea salt or kosher salt with cast iron filings or charcoal. Black Salt is great for removing negativity and I often use it is situations where sea salt alone would not be enough. Some Lucumi formulas call for its help in removing enemies from your path. In fact some people even refer to this as Santeria (La Regla Lucumi) Salt. \n\n\n\nWhich Witchy Dust Where? \n\n\n\nEach one of these salts and dusts have their own special vibrational properties. In my experience a combination of all three is most effective. It\u2019s the same as with roaches, sometimes you have to change up the poison so they don\u2019t get immune. Be sure to us divination, the guidance of your elders, and your own judgment when it comes to spiritual solutions in your own home. Happy sprinkling! \n\n\n\n)0( \n\n\n\nEssential Oils: Are They Safe To Use? \n\n\n\nChances are you\u2019ve probably heard of essential oils \u2014 but what can they really do? Can lavender really help you sleep better? Does citrus actually boost energy? The short answer is yes, when used correctly. \n\n\n\nFrom stress relief to minor pain management, essential oils have a wide range of uses and benefits that can complement traditional health care. As with any supplement, talk to your doctor before adding essential oils into your health routine. In the meantime, here\u2019s some information about essential oils and how to use them safely. \n\n\n\nWhat are essential oils? Essential oils are highly concentrated oils extracted from flowers, fruits, seeds, and plants. Each oil has its own unique fragrance and chemical makeup. Here are some popular types of oils and what they\u2019re often used for: \n\n\n\nWhy people use themTypes of oilCitrusTo boost energy or use for cleaningLemon, citronellaFloral\u00a0To relax or reduce anxietyJasmine, lavender, roseHerbaceousFor a calming effectChamomile, eucalyptus, tea treeCamphoraceousTo clear congestionCamphor, eucalyptus, laurel leafMintyFor an energizing effectSpearmint, wintergreen, peppermintSpicyTo increase energy and focusBasil, cinnamon, ginger\n\n\n\nHow are essential oils used? Aromatherapy: Inhaling oils to help relax the mind and body, either with a diffuser, aroma sticks, or aromatherapy necklaces. \n\n\n\n1 Massage therapy: Applying oils to the skin or mixing oils into lotions for a massage. \n\n\n\nMinor pain relief: Rolling oils, such as lavender or peppermint, onto the temples to relieve headaches and migraine pain. \n\n\n\nRelief from the common cold and nausea: Inhaling oils like eucalyptus and peppermint to open up sinuses, or ginger and peppermint oil to relieve nausea. \n\n\n\n2 Insect repellant: Spraying citronella oil onto your clothes or using it in a diffuser for an environmentally friendly bug repellant. \n\n\n\nHousehold cleaner: Using lemon oil or tea tree oil as a natural alternative to chemical-based household cleaners. \n\n\n\nAre essential oils safe? \n\n\n\nWhen used correctly, essential oils can provide some wellness benefits. But there are no federal regulations around them, so try to buy from reputable companies, and beware of unsupported health claims. \n\n\n\nConsider the following safety tips: \n\n\n\nOnly use diffusers in a well-ventilated space, and make sure to dilute the oil as instructed. As another option, you can use aroma sticks or other aromatherapy accessories. Don\u2019t ingest the oils, which can cause vomiting or other toxic reactions. \n\n\n\nMany essential oils are toxic to pets, so use them with caution. \n\n\n\n3 If you\u2019re planning to apply essential oils topically, like for aromatherapy or massage therapy, consider the following safety tips as well: \n\n\n\nMake sure you\u2019re not allergic to any of the ingredients. If you get a red, itchy rash or hives after rubbing the oil on your skin, be sure to contact your doctor. Never apply undiluted oils directly to your skin. When mixing a carrier oil (lotion, cream, butter, shampoo, etc.) with an essential oil, avoid using dilutions above 5% for adults and 2% for kids. \n\n\n\n4 Looking for a way to relieve stress or minor aches and pains? Essential oils might be a good complement to your regular health care. As with any supplement or alternative treatment, it\u2019s a good idea talk to your doctor before using essential oils for medicinal purposes. \n\n\n\n1 \u201c Stress Management: Why Aromatherapy is Showing up in Hospital Surgical Units,\u201d Mayo Clinic, October 27, 2017. 2See note 1. 3\u201cIs the Latest Home Trend Harmful to Your Pets?

We focus on the things we don\u2019t like in our lives as a way of fueling our efforts to create change. There is nothing inherently wrong with this, and it is one way we make progress. However, if we get too caught up in this way of looking at the world, we lose touch with our ability to sit back and simply say yes to everything on our plates, which is the true starting point for all successful activity. Sometimes what we really need is to encourage ourselves to look deeply into all things in our lives to see the inherent goodness at the heart of everything. \n\n\n\nAt the core of this inquiry is the practice of unconditional acceptance, which can be scary because we feel as if we are being asked not to change the things we don\u2019t like. But when we think this way, we are still operating on the surface of our lives. In order to feel the beauty and warmth of full acceptance, we have to be willing to sink deeper into the stratum underlying the external manifestation of our lives. This deeper place of being is the origin of all lasting change, yet its paradox is that when we are in it, we often don\u2019t feel the need to change anything. From this place, we experience the pure beauty of the process of being alive, and we see that all things change in their own time. We don\u2019t need to force anything. If there are things that we do need to change, from this place of serenity we create the shift easily, our hands guided by an energy that resides at the very center of our hearts. \n\n\n\nIn our active, goal-oriented culture, we learn to distrust stillness and to engage in busywork on the surface of life. This tendency can blind us to the good that lies at the heart of all things. But all we have to do to see again is stop for a moment, let go of our preconceptions and our agendas, and settle into the very center of our hearts, remembering that it is only from here that we can truly see. \n\n\n\n)0( \n\n\n\nDealing With Change \n\n\n\nChange can be both scary and exciting, intimidating and appealing. Rather than avoiding or resisting change, learn to embrace it. Use these crystals to welcome change, however big or small, in any area of your life. \n\n\n\nCHRYSOCOLLA helps you to start fresh. Its energy allows you to feel confident and supported as you begin anew and emerge into the new you. \n\n\n\nLABRADORITE illuminates your limitless potential. Seeing the incredible spectrum of color allows you to imagine the infinite possibilities that are waiting for you. \n\n\n\nPHANTOM QUARTZ helps you break through any self-imposed limitations. This crystal reminds you that change is a necessary part of your journey and breaking through to that next level. \n\n\n\nFLUORITE encourages you to see this period of change as a blessing. It reminds you that with change comes the opportunity to wish for what you always wanted. \n\n\n\nMALACHITE supports your transformation from one state into the next. It reminds you to leave the past and your old self behind as you move forward into the next stage of your life. \n\n\n\nTURQUOISE facilitates healing and supports you during this time of change. \n\n\n\nCRYSTAL INTENTION Change is good. \n\n\n\nThis is an opportunity for me to grow. \n\n\n\nCRYSTAL PRACTICE Hold your crystals in your hands and say out loud, \u201cChange is good. This is an opportunity for me to grow,\u201d 3 times. \n\n\n\nOn a piece of paper, write down 1 obstacle that is holding you back from moving forward. \n\n\n\nFold your paper up and place your Phantom Quartz on top of it. \n\n\n\nHold just your Chrysocolla, Labradorite, and Fluorite and ask yourself, If I had no obstacles in front of me and no limitations for the future, what would I wish for? \n\n\n\nAnd make that wish! When you\u2019re finished, place these two crystals on a windowsill. Lie on your back and place these crystals accordingly: \n\n\n\nMALACHITE over your heart. \n\n\n\nTURQUOISE over your throat. Close your eyes and leave your crystals on your body for 5 to 11 minutes. During this time, visualize your transformation through this period and into the future.",

                "text": "During this week, we have experienced abnormally heavy rain down in the valley, wet snow, a tree crashing wind storm, and then a quick drop in temperature that froze everything from the mountain tops to the valley bottom. We all remembered to bring our 'Yak-trax' and needed them to walk the trail. There wasn't much snow left after the Chinook-like wind storm, but it was all frozen solid, so traction would have been a real problem without the 'Trax'.\u00a0  We hiked along the river bank, looked at the birds Jen pointed out and Hendry identified for us \u2014 not a lot of birds, too many people and their barking dogs, and our crunching footsteps as well.  Hendry did spot a pair of swans flying on the far side of the river, possibly Trumpeter Swans \u2014 not something you see very often around here \u2014 very cool. As you look at the river, you wonder how the ducks can stand to be in the cold water!",

                "text": "I live in Northern Utah. In Northern Utah we usually get snow every winter and most of the time we do experience a white Christmas.  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *Ahem* \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 So, that did not happen. In fact, we have not had a decent snowstorm in\u2026um\u2026I don\u2019t even know. I believe there was this one morning where I had a slippery good time drive to work, and that was it. Rather anticlimactic if you ask me. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Even Texas has had snow!\u00a0 WTF? \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It\u2019s as if there is a problem with global warming or something. \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 At any rate, in Northern Utah it has been just warm enough for me to be comfortable walking my dogs without a jacket. After the sun goes down, I put a sweater on, but that is only to stave off the cooler breeze coming from the north-west. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In short, winter is missing in action. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Therefore, I have decided that my Christmas decorations are not coming down until we have had a decent snow. I am not talking about snow in the mountains where everyone wants it to stay. I am talking about a good old fashioned BIG snowstorm that brings out the crazy drivers and scares the pants off anyone with front wheel drive and bald tires. An honest to goodness storm that dumps inches of powdery snow that is only beautiful for one day (until it becomes a brown and black sludgy mess lining the streets).  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I want to throw snowballs at my dogs, watch them frolic in the snow and I want to yell at them to hurry up and do their business so I can go inside where it is warm. That is what I want!  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Until that happens, I am leaving my Christmas decorations up. Besides, they are happy and colorful and bright, and I am too lazy to put them all away, so I have made a reason to keep them up. If it snows tomorrow, I will consider that well played by Mother Nature. However, it\u2019s not in the forecast therefore I shall not hold my breath.\u00a0  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 [That is a double-dog-dare you to Mother Nature.] \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Bring on the snow\u2026please! Until you do, Christmas is here to stay. I hate Valentine\u2019s Day anyway.",

Click here for the masterlist uwu  \n\nThe local news station hailed it as \u201cthe storm of the century,\u201d and they weren\u2019t wrong. You\u2019ve watched the snow pile up beyond the window, building from a light dusting on the grass to literal knee-high drifts. And it shows no sign of stopping. The place you\u2019re stranded is stocked up on groceries, you\u2019d charged every electronic device to your name, and you\u2019d cranked the thermostat as high as it would go until the inevitable happens \u2014 The power goes out.\u00a0 \nSo now you\u2019re stuck indoors, with only a certain someone for company. The same someone you\u2019ve been pining after for ages. Snow stacks up higher and higher outside. As the cold seeps in, and you both drift closer, you realize this was somehow the one thing you hadn\u2019t thought to prepare for\u2026 \n\n\nWord count: ~3k\n\nPairing: aged-up pro hero!deku x f!reader\n\nCW/tags: mutual pining idiots, pretty vanilla, soft switch!deku and soft switch!reader, hair pulling, (1) choking, praise kink, oral, overstim\n\nNotes:\u00a0Shoutout to @m00ns0ng, @icarusburns747 & @andypantsx3 for the editing and morale support. Tagging @samuslut, @lumos-flies, @abswrites, @shinaus, @saint-eridell\u200b &\u00a0@tomurasprincess\u200b\n\u201cDo we have candles?\u201d Deku called over his shoulder.\u00a0  \n\u201cYeah, I got vanilla scented candles. Just for you, baby,\u201d you joked as you tried to find the missing matches with your phone\u2019s flashlight. You missed Deku flushing red. You smelled like vanilla and he was all about it. \nYou had declared needing a vacation with your former U-A classmates and Deku was the only one who could make it. It paid off to organize a trip with somebody as organized and, um, prepared as Deku. The possibility of it being \u201cthe snowstorm of the century\u201d didn\u2019t escape you two; however, this was the only time you two could sync up for a vacation. And you both desperately needed one.\u00a0 \nDeku needed a break from being the #1 hero and you needed a break from your manager shafting any email he didn\u2019t want to reply to you. Honestly, sometimes you questioned why you chose being a business student instead of a general studies student at U-A. Goddamn.\u00a0 \nPlus, the vacation spot was a lovely, scenic location far from the city. A cabin in the middle of the mountains with an! Outdoor! Hot! Tub! Super sick. You\u2019d never admit to Deku that you excitedly texted Ochako screaming about the idea of going on a vacation just with him.\u00a0 \nThe last time you two had gone on a trip by yourselves was post-high school graduation. The All Might museum road trip was possibly the nerdiest road trip you\u2019ve ever taken but seeing Deku light up was cute as fuck. Except, it was different now. Deku had grown taller and carried himself in a super enticing way. \nYou were shining your phone\u2019s flashlight to \u201chelp him\u201d find the candles\u2014not because you wanted to watch the way his back flex as he rummaged through the cabinets. No, not at all.\u00a0  Keep reading",

                "text": "Hello,  \u00a0  The sun is shining on the snow. It lifts my spirit. Leroy and I went out early to shovel the little bit of snow that had fallen, but more fell and the sun took care of most of it. I suppose we could have waited, but I like getting out. It is fun to shovel when there is just a small amount of light snow. It still looks nice out because there was still quite a bit of snow on the ground from the previous storm.  \u00a0  We took a long walk this afternoon and I almost wished that I had my summer sun hat on to shade my eyes. We had both put sunscreen on our faces.  \u00a0  In the few spots where the sun had not melted the snow on the path there were many footprints, both from humans and dogs. I found it interesting that the footprints direction indicate that people do keep to the right on the trail. I have found that to be true when we meet people, but it must be the majority. There was also a bicycle track. Some are heartier than I am as well as more daring. There were some slippery spots.  \u00a0  We saw a number of people on the trail. One person, we know and several of the rest we recognize their coats more than we recognize their faces. We say hello to almost all that we meet with either a verbal greeting or a wave. I am not sure why, but it makes me feel good to see people using the trail. We are grateful that it is only about two blocks from our house. If I were selling a house I would include that as a good thing.  \u00a0  Paula",

                "text": "(14) Maya \n\u201cI don\u2019t understand it,\u201d Rafi said. \u201cNothing from him all week? Not even a text message?\u201d \n\u201cNothing.\u201d \nWe were on the phone, me in my room packing my bags, and Rafi already up at Cloverleigh Farms. It was Thursday afternoon, which meant a whole week had gone by since the Thanksgiving night kiss. \nA kiss I\u2019d been dreaming about since I was twelve years old. A kiss I\u2019d never forget as long as I lived. A kiss I\u2019d replayed in my head, over and over again, every single night since he\u2019d walked out of the kitchen. \n\u201cI don\u2019t understand it,\u201d she said again. \n\u201cI do.\u201d I added a stack of bras and underwear to my suitcase. \u201cHe told me flat out that we needed to slow down, that he felt like things were moving too fast.\u201d \n\u201cYeah, but there\u2019s a difference between slowing down and slamming on the brakes. All you did was kiss!\u201d \n\u201cYeah, but that was a huge deal for us,\u201d I said. \u201cThis isn\u2019t like I just met someone random at a bar and he brought me home and kissed me. This is Richard Lim.\u201d I placed a pair of jeans and two sweaters into the suitcase. \u201cHe\u2019s not like anyone else. And he\u2019s too good a guy to feed me bullshit. He doesn\u2019t want to start something he can\u2019t finish, and I don\u2019t want to be that girl clinging to blind hope for the rest of my life. He was honest with me, and I respect that.\u201d \n\u201cMaybe he was just really busy this week,\u201d Rafi said brightly. \u201cI told you he put an offer in on that old house by the creek, right?\u201d \n\u201cYou did, and I\u2019m excited for him. But he and I have talked about moving out a lot, so I kind of thought he might tell me about it himself.\u201d I caught sight of my reflection in the mirror and glared at it. \u201cSee? This is the problem with me. I say I\u2019m not going to get my hopes up, and then I do. I say I\u2019m okay with things, and then I\u2019m not. I pick unavailable people, and then I wonder why I get disappointed.\u201d \n\u201cGrrr, it\u2019s so maddening,\u201d said Rafi. \u201cAny idiot could see the way he was staring at you at Thanksgiving.\u201d \nI went back to packing, purposefully tossing in some pajamas that were not sexy in the least. \u201cThanksgiving was a good time. But I think it scared him.\u201d \nShe sighed. \u201cHas your mom forgiven you for the plate?\u201d \n\u201cWho knows? She says she\u2019s not mad, but she\u2019s been weird this week.\u201d \n\u201cWeird like how?\u201d \n\u201cI don\u2019t know. Just quiet. But I feel like she\u2019s looking at me and silently judging. Wondering what I did wrong with Ricky or why he doesn\u2019t want me.\u201d I squeezed my eyes shut. \u201cOr maybe that\u2019s me projecting.\u201d \n\u201cHas she asked about him?\u201d \n\u201cNo,\u201d I admitted, tucking some socks into my suitcase. \u201cTell me again how dressy I need to be for the rehearsal dinner.\u201d \n\u201cI thought you had an outfit planned already.\u201d \n\u201cI did, but now I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m in the right mood for it.\u201d I sank onto my bed and stared at the black dress hanging on the back of my closet door. \u201cMaybe it\u2019s too sexy.\u201d \n\u201cIt\u2019s not.\u201d \n\u201cI can\u2019t wear a bra with it.\u201d \n\u201cWhat are you, my grandma?\u201d \n\u201cAnd it\u2019s tight.\u201d \n\u201cIt shows off your fantastic body!\u201d \nI sighed. \u201cWhat if it looks like I\u2019m trying too hard?\u201d \n\u201cMaya. Stop. If anything, Richard is going to spend the entire night drooling over you and kicking himself for ignoring you all week.\u201d \n\u201cI doubt that.\u201d \n\u201cYou didn\u2019t see what I saw on Thanksgiving. When he watched you come down those stairs, he lit up like he had fireflies under his skin. I\u2019ve never seen anything like it. Wear the damn dress.\u201d \nI smiled, despite everything. \u201cI\u2019ll at least bring it.\u201d \n\u201cWhat time are you leaving?\u201d \n\u201cSoon, I hope. It would be great to get up there before the snow starts.\u201d \n\u201cOh God, don\u2019t talk about the snow. Do you really think we\u2019re going to get as much as they\u2019re saying?\u201d \n\u201cI hope not.\u201d The forecast was dire\u2014we were supposed to get about six inches of snow by tonight and something like another foot and a half by Saturday morning. Rafi was terrified the weather was going to prevent people from being able to make it to the wedding. Not only were lots of people driving up from Bellamy Creek, but her family was flying in from Nashville. \u201cWhen do your parents arrive?\u201d \n\u201cTheir flight is supposed to leave first thing tomorrow.\u201d \n\u201cAre you excited to see them?\u201d \n\u201cYes and no.\u201d Rafi laughed. \u201cI haven\u2019t let my mother near my wedding plans, so she\u2019ll be sure to have plenty to say about all the things I\u2019m doing wrong, but that\u2019s okay. The whole reason I left that life behind was because I didn\u2019t want to live by anyone else\u2019s rules or traditions.\u201d \nRafi had been brought up a wealthy, blue-blooded debutante, but her family had lost all its money after her father took some bad advice and wound up being convicted of tax evasion. But rather than marry rich just to live in luxury again like her mother wanted her to, she\u2019d chosen a different path. She\u2019d been on her way to her new life when her car broke down in Bellamy Creek and she met my brother Ryan. \n\u201cWell, I\u2019m excited to meet them,\u201d I said, determined to focus on the bright side. \u201cWhat are you guys up to this afternoon?\u201d \n\u201cWe\u2019re meeting with the wedding planner at four-thirty to go over some final details, and then we\u2019ve got a dinner reservation at six. I\u2019m just waiting for Ryan to get out of the shower, so we can get going.\u201d \n\u201cHey, does Ryan . . . know? About Ricky and me?\u201d \n\u201cHe definitely thinks something was up between you guys last week, but I didn\u2019t tell him any specifics. It\u2019s weird, because you\u2019re his sister. He\u2019s said a hundred times that he wishes Richard would get back out there, but he can\u2019t exactly be like, \u2018dude, Maya\u2019s into you, you should hit that.\u2019\u201d \nI frowned. \u201cEw. Gross.\u201d \nRafi laughed. \u201cBut Richard\u2019s his best friend. I\u2019m sure he\u2019d be happy to see you together.\u201d \n\u201cNever going to happen,\u201d I said, willing it to sink in once and for all. \u201cI\u2019ve always known it.\u201d \n\u201cYou never know. Maybe this weekend will change things. Weddings are romantic occasions.\u201d \n\u201cI know.\u201d \n\u201cI\u2019ll see you later tonight. Drive carefully, okay?\u201d \n\u201cI will.\u201d \nWe hung up, and I slipped the black dress and my crimson velvet bridesmaid dress into a garment bag. \nFor a moment, I stood there, touching the velvet bodice, imagining Richard in his suit, his arms around me on the dance floor. \nThat was probably as good as it was going to get. \n* * * \nMy mother remained uncharacteristically quiet on the drive up to Cloverleigh Farms. I finally asked her about it, even though I was worried the answer was going to be something like, I\u2019m just so happy for your brother, but I can\u2019t help wondering when you\u2019re going to find the one. \n\u201cSomething on your mind, Mom?\u201d \nShe sighed. \u201cNot really.\u201d \nI gritted my teeth. \u201cI can tell there\u2019s something. You haven\u2019t said a word since we left home. And you\u2019ve been giving me the silent treatment all week. Are you still mad about the plate?\u201d \n\u201cThe what?\u201d My mother seemed genuinely confused for a moment. \u201cOh\u2014no. It\u2019s not that.\u201d \n\u201cWhat is it?\u201d \nShe stared out the passenger side window a moment. \u201cI miss your dad. He should be here for this.\u201d \nImmediately, I felt horrible. Of course she was missing my dad. We all were. Ryan and I had talked about it at Thanksgiving, how sad we were that he\u2019d miss all these big moments in our lives\u2014weddings and babies being born and every milestone afterward\u2014as well as just being around for the little moments, like Sunday dinners and telling dad jokes and the occasional beer after work. \nI shook my head, ashamed I\u2019d assumed her silence this week had been about me. \u201cYou\u2019re right. He should be, and I miss him too.\u201d \nWe were both quiet then, reliving our memories of a man who\u2019d worked so hard all his life, loved his family so fiercely, and had deserved the easy retirement surrounded by grandchildren he never got. A heart attack had stolen everything from him\u2014and him from us\u2014six years ago. \n\u201cHe\u2019d like Rafi, don\u2019t you think?\u201d I asked, attempting to lighten the mood. \n\u201cOh, definitely.\u201d My mother nodded. \u201cBut who wouldn\u2019t?\u201d \n\u201cIt\u2019s so incredible, the way they found each other, isn\u2019t it? I mean, what are the chances that your soul mate is the mechanic who fixes your car after you get stranded in his town?\u201d \n\u201cProbably about the same as your soul mate being the boy next door who\u2019s been there all along,\u201d she said breezily. \n\u201cMom, don\u2019t start. I told you. We\u2019re\u2014\u201d \n\u201cJust friends. I know. Because he doesn\u2019t date.\u201d \n\u201cExactly.\u201d \n\u201cAlthough, I did hear the strangest rumor about Richard at the dry cleaners the other day.\u201d \n\u201cYou did?\u201d \n\u201cYes. Someone said they\u2019d heard he\u2019d recently come out as gay and was in a relationship with James  Ventura.\u201d \nI burst out laughing. \u201cWhat? That\u2019s ridiculous!\u201d \nShe laughed too. \u201cApparently they were seen looking for a house together.\u201d \n\u201cThat\u2019s because James is helping Ricky find a house for him and Abby to move into.\u201d \n\u201cOh. Well, that makes more sense.\u201d She paused. \u201cBut if he was gay, that would explain why he isn\u2019t interested in you.\u201d \n\u201cMom. He\u2019s not gay.\u201d \nShe sighed. \u201cFine.\u201d A minute later, she chuckled. \u201cBut they would make a handsome couple, don\u2019t you think?\u201d \n\u201cDefinitely.\u201d I laughed again too, then turned my windshield wipers on. \u201cLooks like the snow is starting.\u201d \n\u201cOh, dear,\u201d my mother fretted. \u201cI wish they\u2019d chosen a venue closer to home.\u201d \n\u201cWell, Rafi had her heart set on Cloverleigh Farms. And maybe they\u2019re overestimating how much we\u2019ll get. That happens all the time.\u201d \nMy mother crossed herself. \u201cI hope you\u2019re right.\u201d \nBut the snow fell steadily for the rest of the drive, thicker and heavier the farther north we got. I white-knuckled the steering wheel of my Honda, ramrod in my seat, glad I\u2019d let Ryan talk me into new tires this year. \nWe should have arrived at Cloverleigh Farms around seven, but thanks to the weather, it was after nine. We checked into our rooms at the inn\u2014my mother\u2019s was down at the far end of the second floor, and mine was closer to the rest of the wedding party\u2019s\u2014and planned on meeting down at the restaurant for a quick bite, but I was still hanging things up in the closet when she called and said she was too tired and had decided to just order room service instead. \n\u201cAre you sure?\u201d I asked. \u201cRafi just texted and said she and Ryan are down there with some other people.\u201d \n\u201cPositive. You go ahead. I\u2019m pooped, and tomorrow is going to be a long day.\u201d \n\u201cOkay, get some rest. I\u2019ll see you in the morning.\u201d \n\u201cNight, honey.\u201d \n\u201c\u2018Night mom.\u201d I grabbed my purse, tucking my room keycard inside it, and headed down to the bar. \nThe inn was only two stories, and although there was an elevator at the end of the hall, I chose to use the lobby\u2019s grand staircase, which was decorated for the holidays with fragrant evergreen boughs and white lights. As I descended the steps, I looked around and thought it was no wonder Rafi wanted to get married here\u2014the whole place radiated elegance, warmth, and romance. At one end of the room was a huge stone fireplace with logs ablaze inside it. In the corner stood a gigantic Christmas tree hung with white lights and colorful ornaments. In the air was the scent of woodsmoke and apples and cinnamon. From the bar came the cheerful sound of clinking glasses, the hum of conversation punctuated by bursts of laughter, and beneath it all, joyful holiday music. \nI couldn\u2019t help smiling as I entered the cozy, low-lit bar, which was styled like an English pub, with lots of dark wood paneling, a leather banquette and small tables along one wall, and a crackling fire in the fireplace. Right away I spotted Rafi and Ryan at the long wooden bar opposite the banquette and headed their way\u2014then stopped in my tracks when I noticed Richard was with them. \nShit! \nI touched the ribbed knit cap on my head, wishing I\u2019d washed my hair today. What was he doing here? Hadn\u2019t Rafi said he wasn\u2019t coming up until tomorrow morning? \nI looked down in dismay at my traveling outfit, which had clearly been chosen for comfort, not for style. I still had my North Face boots on, for fuck\u2019s sake. And giant slouchy socks. My black leggings were okay, but my rust-colored sweater was a giant baggy thing with a turtleneck and sleeves that were too long. Cozy, but not terribly cute, and a far cry from sexy or alluring. \nI was considering sneaking back up to my room to change, or maybe even order room service, when Rafi caught sight of me. \u201cMaya\u2019s here!\u201d she cried out, loudly enough that everyone around her turned to look at me. \nNo backing out now. Embarrassed, I lifted a hand, which was hidden inside my floppy sleeve. \u201cHi.\u201d \nRafi came rushing toward me, grabbing me in a hug. \u201cSorry,\u201d she whispered. \u201cI didn\u2019t know he was coming early. He just showed up a little bit ago.\u201d \n\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you text me?\u201d I whispered back. \n\u201cI was afraid you wouldn\u2019t come down.\u201d \nI let her go and gave her a dirty look. \u201cThat was a mean trick. Look at me\u2014I look like I just crawled out of bed. Through a blizzard.\u201d \n\u201cYou look adorable,\u201d she said, taking my hand and tugging me toward the bar. \u201cCome on. Frannie\u2019s here, and she can\u2019t wait to see you.\u201d \n\u201cOh, good! I\u2019m excited to see her too.\u201d \nFrannie was also one of Rafi\u2019s bridesmaids. She was an old friend of mine from when I\u2019d student taught in this area, and her family owned Cloverleigh Farms. I\u2019d actually introduced Rafi to her, and for a while\u2014before Ryan had finally figured out that he was in love with Rafi and begged her to come back to Bellamy Creek\u2014she had lived at Cloverleigh and worked as a pastry chef at Frannie\u2019s coffee shop. Carefully avoiding Richard\u2019s eye, I let Rafi pull me over to where Frannie stood with two other women, a blonde I didn\u2019t recognize and an auburn-haired beauty who looked vaguely familiar. \n\u201cHey, you!\u201d Frannie said, giving me a huge hug. \u201cLong time, no see!\u201d \n\u201cHow are you, Frannie?\u201d \n\u201cI\u2019m fine. Life is crazy with five girls at home\u2014I\u2019m amazed Mack hasn\u2019t lost his mind yet\u2014but everything is good.\u201d \nI laughed. Mack, her husband, had three daughters from his first marriage, and Frannie had given birth to their twins the year before. \u201cIs he here?\u201d I asked. \n\u201cYes, he\u2019s over there with the guys.\u201d She nodded in the direction of Ryan and Richard and laughed. \u201cSoaking up the testosterone.\u201d \nI looked over there too, accidentally locking eyes with Richard. He gave me a half-smile, which I returned before looking away, my heart tripping over its next few beats. \n\u201cHow was the drive?\u201d Frannie asked. \u201cDid you get caught in the storm?\u201d \n\u201cIt was a little rough,\u201d I said. \u201cThat snow is coming down hard.\u201d \nRafi closed her eyes a second. \u201cDon\u2019t talk about it. Let\u2019s get you a drink.\u201d \n\u201cSounds good,\u201d I said. \u201cI could use some food as well. Is the kitchen still open?\u201d \n\u201cYes,\u201d answered the redhead, who held out her hand with a smile. \u201cHi, I\u2019m Frannie\u2019s sister April. I think we\u2019ve met, but it was a long time ago.\u201d \n\u201cOh, you\u2019re the wedding planner!\u201d \nShe nodded, giving Rafi a meaningful look. \u201cYes, and everything is going to be perfect, blizzard or not.\u201d \n\u201cI agree,\u201d said Frannie. \u201cHonestly, I think Cloverleigh is more beautiful and romantic covered with snow in the winter than at any other time of year. It\u2019s going to look like a winter wonderland. You\u2019ll see.\u201d \nRafi took a deep breath. \u201cRight.\u201d \n\u201cHi, I\u2019m Alexis,\u201d said the blond woman I didn\u2019t recognize, holding out her hand. \n\u201cOh, Rafi\u2019s college roommate!\u201d I exclaimed, taking her hand in both of mine. \u201cSo nice to meet you. I\u2019m glad you made it in from California before the storm.\u201d \nShe smiled. \u201cMe too. They\u2019re already canceling flights.\u201d \nRafi moaned, her face troubled. \u201cYou guys, I have the worst feeling my parents are not going to make it.\u201d \n\u201cStop.\u201d I put my arm around her. \u201cNo matter what happens with the weather, you are marrying the love of your life tomorrow, right?\u201d \nShe nodded. \u201cRight.\u201d \n\u201cAnd you\u2019re getting me as a sister!\u201d \nThat brought a smile. \u201cRight.\u201d \n\u201cAnd like Frannie said, it\u2019s going to look like a winter wonderland,\u201d Alexis added. \u201cLike a fairy tale.\u201d \n\u201cAbsolutely,\u201d agreed April. \nRafi smiled, her eyes tearing up. \u201cThanks, you guys. I\u2019m so glad to have you here.\u201d \nI squeezed her shoulder. \u201cAnd now I need wine.\u201d \n* * * \nApril suggested we sit at one of the tables opposite the bar. I ended up seated on the banquette, which gave me a perfect view of the guys as they stood sipping whiskey and beers, occasionally guffawing loudly or clapping Ryan on the back. At one point, my brother came over and said hello, asked how the drive was and how our mom was feeling, but Richard continued to keep his distance. \nSeveral times, I caught him glancing over at me, but I pretended not to notice. It made me sad that things were strange between us now, after feeling as if we\u2019d grown closer in the days leading up to Thanksgiving. For heaven\u2019s sake, we\u2019d had phone sex! Good phone sex! I\u2019d heard him have an orgasm, even if it had been mostly silent. Had one real kiss ruined everything? \nI enjoyed chatting with the girls at the table, and the food and wine I\u2019d ordered was delicious, but I was preoccupied the entire time wondering how I was going to get through the weekend if this is how it was going to be between Richard and me. \nEventually, Frannie and Mack left for home, and April\u2019s handsome fianc\u00e9 came to pick her up\u2014he didn\u2019t want her driving alone in the storm\u2014although when Ryan and his friends realized her fianc\u00e9 was former MLB pitching star Tyler Shaw, they dragged him over to the bar and kept him there another twenty minutes. April had to pry him from the conversation to get him out the door. Alexis excused herself shortly afterward, saying she wanted to FaceTime with her kids before they went to bed, which left just Rafi and me at the table. \nShe tipped her head onto my shoulder. \u201cYou okay?\u201d \n\u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d \n\u201cI can tell you\u2019re not. Also, Richard is not. He\u2019s been looking over here all night.\u201d \n\u201cI\u2019ve been trying not to notice that.\u201d I tossed back the wine left in my glass. \nRafi picked up her head. \u201cWell, your job\u2019s about to get harder, because the guys are headed this way.\u201d \nI looked up, and sure enough, Ryan and Richard were approaching our table. I fought the urge to fuss with my hair by pulling my hands inside my monster sleeves. \n\u201cHey,\u201d Ryan said, yawning. \u201cI\u2019ve been up since five, and I\u2019m beat. You about ready to call it a night?\u201d \n\u201cYes, but you go ahead. I\u2019ll stay with Maya. She\u2019s just waiting for the server to bring her check.\u201d \n\u201cNo, go with Ryan,\u201d I said. \u201cI\u2019ll be fine.\u201d \n\u201cI can wait with her,\u201d said Richard. \u201cIf that\u2019s okay.\u201d \nOur eyes met. \u201cIt\u2019s fine.\u201d \nHe dropped into the chair across from me, and Rafi stood up. \u201cOkay. Goodnight, you guys. Maya, I\u2019ll see you at breakfast at eight-thirty?\u201d \n\u201cSounds good.\u201d I watched them walk away, Rafi frantically mouthing text me over her shoulder while pantomiming exaggerated typing motions with her thumbs. \nRichard had some whiskey left, and he swirled it around in the glass. \u201cHow was your drive?\u201d \n\u201cThe first half was okay. Second half a little scary.\u201d I forced a smile. \u201cHow about yours?\u201d \n\u201cAbout the same. I wasn\u2019t going to come up until tomorrow, since I didn\u2019t want to pull Abby from another day of school, but I ended up changing my mind because of the weather. It\u2019s only going to get worse tomorrow, so I picked her up at lunchtime.\u201d \n\u201cI\u2019m sure she was excited. Is she in bed already?\u201d \nHe nodded. \u201cShe was down here with my mom for dinner, but then they went up to bed. They\u2019re sharing a room, so I\u2019ve got my own.\u201d \n\u201cOh.\u201d Immediately my mind went to all the inappropriate activities that could go on in Richard\u2019s hotel room. \u201cThat\u2019s nice.\u201d \nAn awkward silence descended on us. It was late\u2014almost midnight\u2014and the bar had pretty much emptied out. Richard finished his whiskey. \n\u201cSo are you\u2014\u201d \n\u201cI wanted to\u2014\u201d \nAfter speaking at the same time, we both laughed, and the tension eased up a little. \u201cGo ahead,\u201d he said. \n\u201cI was just going to ask if you were excited about making the offer on the new house. I heard you fell in love with the one by the creek.\u201d \nHe nodded, his crooked smile appearing. \u201cYeah. I am excited. We heard today the offer was accepted.\u201d \n\u201cCongratulations.\u201d \n\u201cThanks. It needs a lot of work, but Abby and I both loved it, and James thinks it\u2019s a good buy for the price. He\u2019s going to help me with the renovations over the winter.\u201d \n\u201cCan I see it sometime?\u201d \n\u201cOf course,\u201d he said, sounding surprised I\u2019d even asked. \u201cThe inspection is happening next week, and if all goes well, I\u2019m hoping to close two or three weeks after that and be in by the first of the year.\u201d \n\u201cThat\u2019s really exciting, Ricky. I\u2019m happy for you.\u201d \nThe server brought my check, and I signed it to my room. When we were alone again, Richard smiled at me across the table. \u201cSo is your mom still mad about the plate?\u201d \nI laughed. \u201cI think she\u2019s forgiven us.\u201d \n\u201cGood.\u201d \nAnother silence, during which we locked eyes and the air between us crackled with tension. Was he remembering that kiss? \n\u201cI should go up to bed,\u201d I said, rising to my feet. \n\u201cSame.\u201d He stood too. \u201cWhat floor are you on?\u201d \n\u201cSecond.\u201d \n\u201cMe too. I\u2019ll walk up with you.\u201d \nMy legs felt shaky as we left the bar and climbed the lobby stairs. As we neared my room, I pulled my keycard from my purse. \u201cThis one\u2019s mine,\u201d I said, gesturing toward the door. \nHe nodded. \u201cI\u2019m in two-eighteen.\u201d \n\u201cOh.\u201d I wasn\u2019t sure what to do with that information\u2014other than imagine myself sneaking down to his room. \nNO, my inner adult scolded. No sneaking. \nNo sneaking and no sexting and no saying anything but goodnight. \nBecause the way he was looking at me was making it hard to breathe. \n\u201cWell, goodnight,\u201d I said, opening the door to my room. \n\u201cGoodnight.\u201d He stuck his hands in his pockets. \nI entered my room and shut the door. \nAt least, I tried to shut the door\u2014Richard\u2019s hand shot out and stopped it. \u201cMaya, wait.\u201d \nMy breath caught. \u201cYes?\u201d \n\u201cI just want to say that I\u2019m really glad to see you made it up here safely. I was worried about you making that drive.\u201d \n\u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d I glanced down at my outfit. \u201cA little grungy and disheveled, but fine.\u201d \n\u201cYou\u2019re always beautiful.\u201d \nOur eyes met. I wanted to thank him, but I couldn\u2019t speak. \n\u201cAlso . . .\u201d He struggled for words. \u201cI want you to know that I thought about you all week. And I wish . . .\u201d He paused. \u201cI keep wishing things were different.\u201d \nI smiled and lifted my shoulders. \u201cI wish things were different too, but I appreciate your honesty.\u201d \n\u201cSo we\u2019re okay?\u201d \nThe tightness in my throat made it hard to get the words out. \u201cWe\u2019re okay.\u201d \nHe nodded. \u201c\u2018Night.\u201d \n\u201c\u2018Night.\u201d I closed the door and leaned back against it, trying not to cry. \nWe might be okay, but I was not. \nTo be continued.",

PBS affiliate, features on its website.\u00a0 This treat was a favorite for decades at the Brown Derby restaurant, an institution in golden-age Hollywood.\u00a0 Though the original restaurant itself is gone, many fondly recall its exemplary dessert, hence the recipe. \nOf course, today\u2019s preparation is modified for cupcakes \u2013 much more portable and amenable to sharing that way \u2013 and it features ruby red grapefruit juice and sections.\u00a0 Brighter, more flavorful and sweeter than the standard version, they\u2019re a perfect way to give this sparkling creation even more of a boost. \nElevate it does (who wrote this, Yoda?).\u00a0 The notion that as winter descends one can enjoy fresh fruit, one so expressive of uplifting\u00a0 sunshine, challenges belief.\u00a0 All quite real, though, and the sunny optimism these cupcakes inspire makes one wish for snow to hurry to us, setting in motion the seasonal clock. \nBetter yet, this contains two desserts for the price of one. \u00a0 There\u2019s the sweet, silky cupcake, of course, awash in tanginess. \u00a0\u00a0 Topping it is a flourish of whipped cream cheese, fluffy and sweet, and enlivened with flecks of grapefruit.\u00a0 Evocative of cheesecake, more than anything else. \nCommon to both is the grapefruit, unadorned.\u00a0 It needs no enhancement, as it\u2019s exuberantly sweet all by itself, particularly the ruby red variety.\u00a0 Even as a storm rushes in from parts distant, the grapefruit recalls the sunshine which brightened our past and which surely will illuminate our future. \n***** \nGrapefruit (Cup)Cake(s) \nFor the cake: \n\n1 and 1/2 cups cake flour\n3/4 cup sugar\n1 and 1/2 teaspoons baking powder\n1/2 teaspoon salt\n1/4 cup water\n1/4 cup vegetable oil\n3 eggs, separated\n3 tablespoons grapefruit juice (*1)\n1/2 teaspoon grated lemon rind (*2)\n1/2 teaspoon cram of tartar\n\nFor the cream cheese frosting: \n\n2 6-ounce packages of cream cheese\n2 teaspoon lemon juice (*2)\n1 tablespoon grated lemon rind (*2)\n3/4 cup powdered sugar\n1 1-pound can of grapefruit sections, drained (*1)\n\nPlace the cream cheese on the counter to soften, then start making the cake.\u00a0 In a large bowl sift together the flour, sugar, baking powder and salt.\u00a0 Make a well in the center and into it add the water, oil, egg yolks, grapefruit juice and lemon rind.\u00a0 Whisk until smooth. \nIn a mixer fitted with the whisk attachment, add the egg whites and cream of tartar.\u00a0 Starting at a low speed, blend the ingredients.\u00a0 Once they\u2019re incorporated, gradually increase the speed to high.\u00a0 Mix until the whites are firm but not quite stiff (*3), about three minutes. \nPreheat the oven to 350\u00b0 and place cupcake liners in a cupcake tray. \nRemove the bowl from the mixer, scraping clean the whisk with a spatula.\u00a0 Slowly pour the egg yolk mixture over the egg whites, folding them together with the spatula.\u00a0 Take care not to mix them too vigorously, as that will \u201cdeflate\u201d the egg whites.\u00a0 Folding them until they\u2019re just incorporated is all that\u2019s necessary. \nFill the cupcake liners 3/4 of the way with batter, then bake for 25 minutes.\u00a0 While the cupcakes bake, wash the mixer bowl and whisk. \nRemove the cupcake tray to a wire rack.\u00a0 When cool enough to handle, after about ten minutes, remove the individual cupcakes and place them on the rack individually to finish cooloing. \nAfter the cupcakes have started their final cooling, make the frosting. \u00a0\u00a0 Fit the mixer with the whisk attachment again and add the now-softened cream cheese to the bowl.\u00a0 Beat the cream cheese at high speed until fluffy, about two minutes.\u00a0 Stop the mixer and add the lemon rind and juice. \nReturn mixer to low speed and slowly pour in the powdered sugar.\u00a0 Once incorporated, increase the speed to high for a moment to revive the fluff. \nTake two or three grapefruit sections and mince them.\u00a0 Using a spatula, gently fold these into the frosting.\u00a0 Put the frosting in a pastry bag fitted with a wide tip and pipe the frosting onto the cupcakes.\u00a0 Garnish with grapefruit sections and serve. \nNOTES: \n1 \u2013 Do yourself a favor and opt for the ruby red grapefruit juice and sections.\u00a0 Normal grapefruit is fine, though ruby red is extraordinary. \n2 \u2013 Likewise, use Meyer lemons if you can get them.\u00a0 As Meyers are a lemon-tangerine hybrid, their mild sweetness makes them a perfect accompanyment to grapefruit. \n3 \u2013 Just what did you think I meant?",

                "text": "MSGM Fall 2021 Menswear Collection - Vogue.com                      MSGM Fall 2021 Menswear Collection - Vogue.com       Posted: 17 Jan 2021 04:05 AM PST   Massimo Giorgetti, a bona fide seaside creature (he was born and bred in Rimini, a popular Italian summer resort on the Adriatic coast), recently came under the spell of mountain life: \"At my green age of 44-years-old, after a lifetime spent in bathing suits on the beach, I must confess I've fallen in love with alpine landscapes and high altitudes\u2014and with the lives of famous mountaineers,\" he said over Zoom. \"They were men as adventurous as they were handsome\u2014which is always a good combination.\"   Having recently spent a lot of restorative time roaming the valleys in Northern Italy, Giorgetti was utterly smitten by their beauty.\u00a0 \"Mountains are about solitude, oxygen, breath\u2014their energy so potent,\" he mused. In the MSGM men's collection he wanted to convey the powerful feel of experiencing such naturalistic magnitude.   \"Vertigine\" (the Italian translation of Vertigo) was the collection's title, a word which captures the dizzy sensation high altitudes can induce; but it was also chosen by Giorgetti as a metaphor for what we've been experiencing in our quarantined circumstances\u2014an unsettling feel of being at a loss, almost to the point of falling off-balance. Although being naturally equipped with abundant doses of optimism, Giorgetti acknowledged that times are tough, and that #pandemicfatigue is taking its toll. But being able to escape even briefly to his beloved mountains has proved an energizing antidote\u2014part adrenaline boost, part calm introspection.     The collection riffed on the winter sports repertoire, slaloming between high-performance techno gear and retro-tinged sophistication. Heritage throwbacks were powered by MSGM's energetic streetwear punch and flavored with a '90s underground rave vibe. Tweed short suits with a vintage St. Moritz feel were worn under oversized blown-up down hoodies in lysergic colors; postcards of luxury '30s ski resorts were twisted into magnified prints. Denim trousers and anoraks were lasered with outlines of the Mont Blanc silhouette\u2014they looked cool paired with XXXL boxy shirts in eye-popping colors, printed in abstract motifs imitating the textures of rocks and the icy reflections of glaciers.     The collection's vibe conveyed images more suggestive of a cool trippy rave in the mountains than a healthy snowboarding picnic in the Swiss Alps. The feel was enhanced by the electronic soundtrack of the online-streamed video presented today during Milan Men's Fashion Week\u2014a pulsing, high-octane affair composed and performed by Italian artist Nico Vascellari and his band Ni\u00f1os du Brasil.   Asked to expand on the creative concept behind the video, which reproduced models walking randomly under a snowstorm (perhaps a hopeful future post-lockdown scenario of boys on their way to an undisclosed party location in the mountains?), Giorgetti said that this season he opted out of the artistic collaborations which have frequently been part of his fashion practice: \"I wanted something normal. Honest. Simple. Experimentation is well and good. But nothing can beat a good, old-fashioned, no-nonsense fashion show,\" he said. \"Even under the snow would do.\"               Salma Hayek showcases incredible figure in cut-out slinky beach dress for this amazing reason - HELLO!

                "text": "By\u00a0CODY CASSIDY,\u00a0BACKCHANNEL, Wired Long Reads01.13.2021 08:00 AM Don\u2019t be a young, healthy, single man. That\u2019s our first piece of advice. LET\u2019S SAY YOU want to strike it rich. The year is 1846 and you\u2019re somewhere in the Midwest pulling potatoes out of the ground. But you\u2019re tired of pulling potatoes. You want to pull gold. And maybe you\u2019ve heard the rumors: People are finding fortunes in the foothills of the Sierra Nevada. 1 So you hitch up your Conestoga wagon and head west, joining that year\u2019s convoy of California-bound immigrants. And on July 20, you and the rest of these early pioneers find yourselves staring at a crossroads in what is today southwest Wyoming. Like them, you\u2019ll face a choice: Turn right or turn left?  1If you want to really strike it rich, forget your gold pan and bring your sewing needle. The real pot of gold in the Gold Rush is selling sturdy denim trousers.  Both trails lead to California, but the trail to the right detours far north. It meanders deep into Idaho before it reverses course and turns back south into eastern Nevada. The left trail eschews the northern deviation. It takes a straight shot across Utah, and by doing so removes almost 350 miles from your journey. So let\u2019s say you look at a map, note the faster route, and decide to turn left.  At the time, this seems like the wise choice. Andrew Hastings, an adventurer and respected guide, had just scouted this shortcut on horseback the winter before and advertised his new cutoff in guidebooks and postings along the trail. Most of the convoy, fearful of the unknown and unwilling to trust one person\u2019s word, turn right. But you\u2019re not the only one keen to arrive early in California. When you turn left on that July day, 20 other wagons do the same. After a few uneventful days, you and the rest of these previously unconnected pioneers will caravan together for safety and, following some debate, you\u2019ll elect a nice, older, wealthy fellow as the leader of your party. His name is George Donner. ILLUSTRATION: CODY CASSIDY; KEVIN PLOTNER  THE PROBLEM WITH Hastings\u2019 trail, as you\u2019ll soon discover, is that there is no trail. It\u2019s just a line he drew on a map, and the line runs right over Utah\u2019s Wasatch mountains. Because there is no trail, you\u2019ll have to carve your way up with axe and shovel. The 36-mile crossing that you had planned to make in three days will instead take three weeks.  On August 20, exhausted and low on supplies, you\u2019ll reach the peak of the Wasatch only to be greeted by a sickening view: The Great Salt Lake Desert. Hastings will have prepared you for this \u201cdry drive,\u201d saying it would be a difficult but manageable 40 miles. In reality, the distance is more like 80. You\u2019ll have to drive your parched cattle for six days and six nights, desperate to get to water.  When you finally reach the other side, your party will have lost three wagons and a quarter of its oxen. Recriminations begin, tensions fray: When you hit a second desert in Nevada, an argument breaks out between James Reed and John Snyder, and Reed stabs Snyder to death. Reed is banished.2 Two days later, Lewis Keseberg kicks a Mr. Hardkoop out of his wagon to lighten his load and leaves Hardkoop to die.  Which probably saves his life\u2014the Donner Party is an excellent one to be disinvited from\u2014but his banishment may save yours as well. Reed will eventually become the chief organizer of the rescue party.  The Hastings route will have cost you lives, friends, wagons, food, supplies, tools, livestock\u2014but it will also have cost you your most precious asset of all: time. Instead of cutting three weeks from your journey, the Hastings cutoff will have added almost four. So rather than rolling safely into Sacramento on October 13, you\u2019ll instead arrive in what is today Reno, Nevada, and prepare for your ascent into the Sierra Nevada.

Late October and even early November is early for heavy snow in these mountains. In a typical year, the pass wouldn\u2019t see heavy snow for another few weeks. \u201cNinety percent of the time, the Donner Party would have made it,\u201d Mark McLaughlin, a historian of the Sierra Nevada and author of The Donner Party: Weathering the Storm, tells me.  Unfortunately, the winter of 1846 starts early. Two weeks of snow has buried the top of the Sierras by the time you arrive, and the weather\u2019s terrible turn is as unlucky as it is decisive. Oxen always struggle to haul wagons up the steep granite walls protecting Truckee Pass (now Donner Pass), but when you attempt it on November 1, you\u2019ll find it buried in five feet of powder. Less than three miles from the summit, you will face two terrible options: one, abandon your wagons and cattle, fashion snowshoes, and trek for Sacramento and your life; or two, retreat to a few cabins by Truckee Lake that previous pioneers constructed a few years prior. The Donners chose to retreat.  When I ask Bill Bowness, a historian at Donner Memorial State Park, whether you should do the same, he believes fewer Donners would have died had they abandoned their gear and made the trek. So he recommends you go for it. But others, like McLaughlin, aren\u2019t so sure. For one thing, a large snowstorm hits the Sierra in the first week of November, and for another, a later attempt by some of the party to snowshoe from Truckee Lake to Sutter\u2019s Fort in Sacramento suggests the trip could take as long as a month. If you try to hike out you\u2019ll likely run out of food, probably suffer frostbite, and potentially die from exposure. So play it safe. Retreat to the lake along with the rest of the Donner Party and hole up in those cabins. Just be aware that by doing so, you\u2019re condemning yourself to a winter in the mountains. The Donner Party, apparently, did not know this. They believed the Sierra, like the mountains they knew in the Midwest, would clear once the weather passed. They won\u2019t. ILLUSTRATION: CODY CASSIDY; KEVIN PLOTNER  Food will soon become a problem. A few try to hunt, but this is largely hopeless, since the large animals either evacuate the mountains or hibernate in winter. The only animals that remain are too small to shoot, Bowness tells me, though you could possibly trap them. Moses Schallenberger, a 17-year-old pioneer, survived the winter of 1844 alone in the Sierras by trapping coyote and fox. (Coyote tastes terrible, he later said, but fox is delicious.) Unfortunately, while the Donners are strong, smart, hardworking, entrepreneurial, and industrious, they\u2019re Midwestern farmers. Not mountain men. They don\u2019t have traps, nor the fishing gear to catch trout from the lake, and may not have known how to use either if they did. If you\u2019re going to eat, it\u2019s going to have to be the oxen and the food that came with you in the wagons.  You\u2019ll finish the last of your food stores in days. Then you\u2019ll eat your oxen. Then, just six weeks after hunkering down at the lake, you\u2019ll try to eat leather: You\u2019ll boil it for hours until it turns into a pulp, allow it to cool, and try to eat the resulting gluelike substance. You are now starving to death.  Soon you\u2019ll begin to experience small but noticeable signs of physical and cognitive decline. Your brain will switch its energy source from glucose to fats, and you\u2019ll feel increasingly irritable, low-energy, and cold as you lose the ability to efficiently constrict your blood vessels. Without food, your body will consume itself for the energy it needs. It will start with the proteins and fats, but because you\u2019ve already lost so much weight it will soon harvest muscle, including your heart. Once you\u2019ve lost 35 percent of your body weight from your already skinny baseline, you may experience convulsions and hallucinations. Your weakened heart will then develop an arrhythmia and eventually fail.  But exactly how long it takes your body to reach these grim milestones depends on a few important factors: how much you move, how much you eat, your age, your relationship status, and, most important, your sex.  If you\u2019re a twentysomething single man in peak physical shape\u2014you\u2019re in extreme danger. You have the least fat reserves, the highest metabolism, and no one to help you: Young men in good shape with no families die first in starvation situations. If that describes you, and you don\u2019t follow the steps below, you\u2019ll be dead by Christmas.  In the final 10 days of December, after eight weeks trapped by the lake, Bayless Williams, Jacob Donner, Samuel Shoemaker, Joseph Reinhardt, James Smith, and Charles Burger all die. All of them are men, and all except Donner, who is 56, are between the ages of 24 and 36. You\u2019ll bury them in shallow, icy graves just outside the cabins.  When I asked Donald Grayson, a professor of anthropology at the University of Washington and author of Sex & Death on the Western Emigrant Trail, why young men starve the fastest and how you can survive if you have the unfortunate luck of being one, he said young men are at risk for a few reasons. The first is cultural.  The gender roles of 1800s pioneers were clear: \u201cIt was the expectation of the men at the time that they would perform the heavy labor, and that\u2019s exactly what happened,\u201d Grayson says. Hard work increases your metabolism, so in a cruel twist, the more you helped with carving the trail over the Wasatch, the faster you\u2019ll die. If you\u2019re a woman, you\u2019re in less immediate danger than a man, not only thanks to cultural advantages, but a few natural ones as well. Women on average have less lean mass than men and more subcutaneous fat, which means their bodies have more stored calories and a lower natural metabolism. In other words, if you\u2019re a woman you have both more fuel and better mileage than a man. And you are a long way from a gas station.  This advantage will not only prolong your survival at camp, but it also gives you an opportunity for escape that a man would be ill-advised to pursue: On December 16, 10 men and five women fashion snowshoes and make a desperate scramble over the pass.  The trip is hellish. You\u2019ll lose your way. You\u2019ll spend a week trapped by a blizzard. You\u2019ll hike for another five freezing weeks with almost no food. But while eight of the 10 men who set off die, all five women survive. So, if you\u2019re a woman, you can consider escaping with the December 16 group\u2014though the trip is so awful it\u2019s difficult to recommend. If you\u2019re a man: hard pass.  Instead, not only should you skip the arduous hike\u2014you should do nothing at all. You need to flatline your metabolism. If you reduce your movement, you can reduce your caloric requirements by some 50 to 80 percent. Rather than working to survive, you want to be in the worst shape of your life. \u201cOn the Donner Party, you absolutely want to be a couch potato, not a marathoner,\u201d Grayson says. As proof he points to the example of George Donner, who had a hand infection that kept him bedridden throughout the winter. He survived well into March, long after most men around his age had already starved.  By avoiding exercise entirely, and by skipping the starvation hike, you should survive at least into January. But by the first week of February, with salvation still at least three weeks away, you\u2019ll have eaten almost nothing for over a month, and your situation will become perilous. In the late days of January and the first week of February, Landrum Murphy, Augustus Spitzer, Milt Elliot, and Eleanor Eddy\u2014the first woman to starve\u2014all die by the lake. If you don\u2019t find something to eat, you may soon join them. Fortunately, there\u2019s food all around you. You\u2019ll just have to overcome a powerful taboo to eat it.  EATING HUMAN FLESH hasn\u2019t always been so distasteful. At least socially.  Archeologists have found butchered human bones far too frequently for it to have been a sporadic, starvation-only practice. And before Western culture washed over the globe, ritualistic cannibalism was not uncommon.  \u201cThe Wari\u2019 [an indigenous people of the Amazon rainforest] were just as mortified to learn that Westerners were burying their dead as the Westerners were to learn that the Wari\u2019 were eating theirs,\u201d Bill Schutt, author of Cannibalism: A Perfectly Natural History, tells me.  In other words, the revulsion to cannibalism is not innate. It\u2019s a societal taboo without a Darwinian explanation (such as incest).3 What sets it apart from other social taboos is its remarkable power. The Donner Party might be infamous for its cannibalism, but more than a dozen members of the party starved to death rather than eat the already dead.  In fact, there\u2019s good reason to believe natural selection should have selected for cannibalism rather than against it. After all, when practiced appropriately it can save lives. It\u2019s about to save yours.  When I asked Schutt how the cannibalism taboo became strong enough that a person might die rather than break it, he says it\u2019s partly due to its antiquity. People have feared and despised cannibals for so long that it may feel as if you\u2019re breaking some law of nature when you\u2019re breaking off a rib. But what you\u2019re actually doing is breaking a social norm invented by a few xenophobic ancient Greeks, according to Schutt.  Schutt has traced the earliest examples of the taboo in Western culture to some of the earliest Greek stories, such as the tale of Polyphemus and Odysseus in Homer\u2019s Odyssey. In what may be the first example of a writer depicting cannibalism as the act of a monster, the cyclops Polyphemus catches Odysseus and his men stealing from him and in turn begins eating them one by one until Odysseus blinds the giant.4  Homer may have invented the trope, but he was far from the last to use it. See zombies, Dracula, Hansel and Gretel, Little Red Riding Hood, Snow White, and basically every other story written by the Brothers Grimm.  \u201cThe Greeks used cannibalism as a way to define the worst behavior possible in another group,\u201d Schutt tells me. The probable explanation for why they chose cannibalism to represent the act of a monster is fairly straightforward: It\u2019s what their northern European enemies, the Androphagi (Greek for \u201cman-eaters\u201d), did. For the Greeks, human flesh was the food of foreigners\u2014and thus eating it the lowest one could stoop. From there, the stigma only grew.  \u201cThe Romans took the taboo from the Greeks, where it combined with Judeo-Christian beliefs about how you treat the dead,\u201d Schutt says. Combine that with the racism of early anthropologists, who used its practice as justification to commit cultural genocide, and the stigma compounded.  Many in the Donner Party refused to cannibalize at the cost of their lives. No cannibalism took place among the Donner Party members trapped by the lake until at least late February, after at least 13 people starved and died.5 Don\u2019t be one of them. There is frozen food buried by the lake. If you want to survive, you\u2019ll need to eat it. The calories will keep you alive, and for far longer than you might expect. Of those who eventually cannibalized, Keseberg appears to have done so with the most vigor, and he not only survived but, for reasons unknown, he skipped the first two rescue parties and yet was still alive and strong enough to hike out with the third on April 17.  The hikers on the December attempt to hike out did eat Franklin Graves, Antonio (last name unknown), Patrick Dolan, and Jay Fosdick after they died. There\u2019s also reason to believe one of the hikers, a man named William Foster, shot two Miwok Native American guides named Louis and Salvador for food, which is the only instance anyone in the Donner Party was killed and eaten. The rest of the cannibalized were already dead.  When practicing cannibalism, there are a few safety precautions one must take. First, cook your meat thoroughly to avoid diseases. No tartars or carpaccios. Also, avoid the brain. You run a small risk of catching a deadly prion disease called kuru from eating it. Instead, target the thighs, butt, calves, and back muscles for the highest caloric returns. As for the choice cuts beyond that, refer to the table below, which relies on data compiled by James Cole in his study of the caloric returns of cannibalism. At 32,000 calories per body (based on a 145-pound male body, which while light may be accurate in this case, since you\u2019re eating people who starved) and at least 13 bodies, there will be plenty of food for you to eat and even share until the arrival of the first rescue party.  SOURCE: NATURE, ASSESSING THE CALORIFIC SIGNIFICANCE OF EPISODES OF HUMAN CANNIBALISM IN THE PALAEOLITHIC, JAMES COLE  Finally, if you\u2019re considering best prep methods or pairings, then according to the journalist William Seabrook, who claimed to have partaken in ritual cannibalization in the 1920s, you can expect for it to taste like veal.  Adequately fed, you should survive until February 18, when seven rescuers arrive. Unfortunately, their arrival doesn\u2019t guarantee your survival. The snow is still far too deep for horses, so the rescuers have only brought a small amount of extra rations, and everyone they take has to hike out under their own power. You should too, though it\u2019s not a pleasant trip. The rescuers cached some food on their way in, but it has mostly gotten stolen by animals. Still, 21 Donner Party members trek out with these mountaineers, and only two die.  After eight days of hiking you\u2019ll arrive at a forward camp in Bear Valley, where you\u2019ll finally find a pantry full of delicious food. Don\u2019t eat it. Or, at least, don\u2019t eat very much. A full meal right now might result in a lethal electrolyte imbalance called refeeding syndrome. Starvation has dropped minerals like phosphate and magnesium to dangerously low levels in your body, and because digestion will draw these minerals from your blood, eating can actually kill you. William Hook, who hikes out with you in the first rescue, gorges himself in the Bear Valley pantry and dies the morning after you arrive.  Of the 85 members of the Donner Party originally trapped in the Sierras, 51 eventually arrive safely in California. And you can too. Even if you are young, single, male, or in great shape. These handicaps can be overcome. Just move as little as possible, learn to love pulpy, gluelike leather food, say no to joining the snowshoeing group, wait for the first rescue party. And, of course, be ready to overcome that old taboo passed down by a few xenophobic ancient Greeks.  Or you can just turn right.

                "text": "Why Snow Squalls Can Be So Deadly\u00a0  It's winter. The sky is clear, the air crisp, the temperature has  dipped below freezing. You're rolling down the interstate at 70 miles  (112 kilometers) per hour, not a care in the world. It's practically a  winter wonderland. \t\t \t  \t  \t\tBut have you ever heard of a snow squall? If you have, then you should know the first rule of winter driving when a snow squall bares its icy teeth: Slow the heck down.  \t\t \t  \t  \t\tSnow squalls don't happen in every place that has winter weather.  And even in those locales that do, snow squalls aren't everyday events.  But if you happen to live or travel in one of those wintry places,  squalls come around occasionally enough that you should be aware that  they're not to be trifled with. Snow squalls, as brief as they are (most  last no longer than 30 minutes), are serious. Sometimes deadly serious.  \t\t \t  \t  \t\t\"Think of them as a winter weather analog to a severe thunderstorm,\" says Pete Banacos, a science and operations officer at the National Weather Service Forecast Office in Burlington, Vermont. \"You're dealing with that kind of intensity.  It's not as unstable, but it's the same type of atmospheric process.\" Flurry, Storm, Blizzard ... Squall? \t\t \t  \t  \t\tIn winter weather parlance, there are snowstorms and there are snowstorms.  A snow squall is a legitimate, recognized weather phenomenon, a storm  that deserves the italics. In the U.S., squalls can occur anywhere from  the northeast (Vermont has several of them every year) to the upper  plains to the foot of the Rockies. Anyplace it snows, in fact, can be  smacked with a squall if the conditions are right.  \t\t \t  \t  \t\tBut let's back up for a second: What is a snow squall? Not as  snow-heavy or as long-lasting as a blizzard, but more than a little  flurry, squalls \"are brief, intense snow showers accompanied by strong,  gusty winds. Accumulation may be significant. Snow squalls are best  known in the Great Lakes region,\" according to the National Severe Storms Laboratory (which, like the NWS, is a division of the National Oceanic and  Atmospheric Administration, an arm of the U.S. Department of Commerce).  \t\t \t  \t  \t\tBanacos has been researching snow squalls for more than a decade. A  few years ago, he and some colleagues conducted a study of 36 squalls  over a 10-year period in upper New York and Vermont. The February 2014  study, published in the Journal of Operational Meteorology,  found that the median duration for a snow squall was only 17 minutes.  The accumulation of snow, at least for the 11 squalls in the study that  affected Burlington, was only about an inch (2.5 centimeters). The Awesome Power of Snow \t\t \t  \t  \t\tBut an inch of snow in, say, only 20 minutes or so, with swirling  winds that Banacos says can be well in excess of 35 mph (56 kph), makes  for near whiteout conditions. Visibility in snow squalls, by definition,  is less than a quarter-mile (0.4 kilometers). The storms, like  thunderstorms, can even include lightning.  \t\t \t  \t  \t\t\"A big part of this is just the surprise factor. People are driving  along, it can be clear blue sky, and then all of a sudden you run into a  snow squall,\" Banacos says. \"Maybe someone left their house and all  they heard was there's a 30 percent chance of snow showers today. Then  the next thing you know, they're in these blizzard-like conditions.\"  \t\t \t  \t  \t\tAdd slick roads,  especially in mid-winter when surfaces are most likely to freeze, and  you have the potential for deadly multivehicle pileups that can cause  millions of dollars of damage. In December 2019, 30 vehicles wrecked in Union County, in central Pennsylvania, during a snow squall. Two people died and as many as 44 others were injured. Twenty-nine vehicles wrecked in November 2020 along a Minnesota interstate during a snow squall, injuring nine. Some 200 vehicles were involved in a snow squall pileup in Michigan in 2015.  \t\t \t  \t  \t\tThose defining characteristics of a snow squall \u2014 brief and  intense, with whiteout conditions \u2014 make the storms dangerous if you're  on the road but awesome to watch if you're not. In December 2020, a  Twitter user captured video of one as it rolled over Steamboat Springs, Colorado.  \t\t \t  \t  \t\tMaking it Through a Snow Squall \t\t \t  \t  \t\tSnow squalls often happen on the leading edge of an arctic cold front. When the supercharged cold air hits warmer air, convection \u2014 the vertical transfer of air \u2014 causes heavy winds, flash freezes and  snow. In a matter of a few minutes that sunny, speedy day out on a dry  interstate can turn to tragedy.  \t\t \t  \t  \t\tThat makes predicting squalls, and alerting motorists to their possibility, critically important.  \t\t \t  \t  \t\t\"We've gotten a lot better,\" over the past decade or so, Banacos  says. \"Typically we'll know there's potential two to three days in  advance. And then, down to the level of being able to say precisely what  cities and towns, at what hour, will be impacted, we can get a feel for  that six to 12 hours in advance. That's when we can really pin it down.  \t\t \t  \t  \t\t\"And then once we see the snow squall actually on radar, that's  when we can issue a snow squall warning, and the National Weather  Service meteorologists can go ahead and draw those warnings.\"  \t\t \t  \t  \t\tOnce meteorologists see a snow squall on radar, they issue alerts, including Wireless Emergency Alerts to WEA-capable cellphones in the area. They include a special tone and  vibration, repeated twice, similar to emergency calls like Amber Alerts.  The short message: \"Sudden whiteouts. Icy roads. Slow down!\" The longer  one: \"Slow down or delay travel! Be ready for a sudden drop to near  zero visibility and icy roads in heavy snow.\"  \t\t \t  \t  \t\tExperts advise avoiding travel when a snow squall is forecast. If you're already on the road,  get off as soon as is safely possible. And if you're stuck on a long  stretch of highway when a sudden snow squall descends, the best advice  is to turn on your headlights, leave a lot of room between you and other  vehicles, stay off your brakes if possible to avoid losing control on  the slippery road surface ... and slow the heck down. \t\t\t\t* * * \t\t\t\t\t\t\tA  snow squall might seem like a blizzard when you're in it, and the two  weather phenomena share some qualities. But, according to the NWS, a blizzard has to last at least three hours with snow falling; squalls don't last nearly that long. If winds whip  up existing snow, but with no new falling snow, it's called a ground  blizzard.",

                "text": "Why Snow Squalls Can Be So Deadly\u00a0  It's winter. The sky is clear, the air crisp, the temperature has  dipped below freezing. You're rolling down the interstate at 70 miles  (112 kilometers) per hour, not a care in the world. It's practically a  winter wonderland. \t\t \t  \t  \t\tBut have you ever heard of a snow squall? If you have, then you should know the first rule of winter driving when a snow squall bares its icy teeth: Slow the heck down.  \t\t \t  \t  \t\tSnow squalls don't happen in every place that has winter weather.  And even in those locales that do, snow squalls aren't everyday events.  But if you happen to live or travel in one of those wintry places,  squalls come around occasionally enough that you should be aware that  they're not to be trifled with. Snow squalls, as brief as they are (most  last no longer than 30 minutes), are serious. Sometimes deadly serious.  \t\t \t  \t  \t\t\"Think of them as a winter weather analog to a severe thunderstorm,\" says Pete Banacos, a science and operations officer at the National Weather Service Forecast Office in Burlington, Vermont. \"You're dealing with that kind of intensity.  It's not as unstable, but it's the same type of atmospheric process.\" Flurry, Storm, Blizzard ... Squall? \t\t \t  \t  \t\tIn winter weather parlance, there are snowstorms and there are snowstorms.  A snow squall is a legitimate, recognized weather phenomenon, a storm  that deserves the italics. In the U.S., squalls can occur anywhere from  the northeast (Vermont has several of them every year) to the upper  plains to the foot of the Rockies. Anyplace it snows, in fact, can be  smacked with a squall if the conditions are right.  \t\t \t  \t  \t\tBut let's back up for a second: What is a snow squall? Not as  snow-heavy or as long-lasting as a blizzard, but more than a little  flurry, squalls \"are brief, intense snow showers accompanied by strong,  gusty winds. Accumulation may be significant. Snow squalls are best  known in the Great Lakes region,\" according to the National Severe Storms Laboratory (which, like the NWS, is a division of the National Oceanic and  Atmospheric Administration, an arm of the U.S. Department of Commerce).  \t\t \t  \t  \t\tBanacos has been researching snow squalls for more than a decade. A  few years ago, he and some colleagues conducted a study of 36 squalls  over a 10-year period in upper New York and Vermont. The February 2014  study, published in the Journal of Operational Meteorology,  found that the median duration for a snow squall was only 17 minutes.  The accumulation of snow, at least for the 11 squalls in the study that  affected Burlington, was only about an inch (2.5 centimeters). The Awesome Power of Snow \t\t \t  \t  \t\tBut an inch of snow in, say, only 20 minutes or so, with swirling  winds that Banacos says can be well in excess of 35 mph (56 kph), makes  for near whiteout conditions. Visibility in snow squalls, by definition,  is less than a quarter-mile (0.4 kilometers). The storms, like  thunderstorms, can even include lightning.  \t\t \t  \t  \t\t\"A big part of this is just the surprise factor. People are driving  along, it can be clear blue sky, and then all of a sudden you run into a  snow squall,\" Banacos says. \"Maybe someone left their house and all  they heard was there's a 30 percent chance of snow showers today. Then  the next thing you know, they're in these blizzard-like conditions.\"  \t\t \t  \t  \t\tAdd slick roads,  especially in mid-winter when surfaces are most likely to freeze, and  you have the potential for deadly multivehicle pileups that can cause  millions of dollars of damage. In December 2019, 30 vehicles wrecked in Union County, in central Pennsylvania, during a snow squall. Two people died and as many as 44 others were injured. Twenty-nine vehicles wrecked in November 2020 along a Minnesota interstate during a snow squall, injuring nine. Some 200 vehicles were involved in a snow squall pileup in Michigan in 2015.  \t\t \t  \t  \t\tThose defining characteristics of a snow squall \u2014 brief and  intense, with whiteout conditions \u2014 make the storms dangerous if you're  on the road but awesome to watch if you're not. In December 2020, a  Twitter user captured video of one as it rolled over Steamboat Springs, Colorado.  \t\t \t  \t  \t\tMaking it Through a Snow Squall \t\t \t  \t  \t\tSnow squalls often happen on the leading edge of an arctic cold front. When the supercharged cold air hits warmer air, convection \u2014 the vertical transfer of air \u2014 causes heavy winds, flash freezes and  snow. In a matter of a few minutes that sunny, speedy day out on a dry  interstate can turn to tragedy.  \t\t \t  \t  \t\tThat makes predicting squalls, and alerting motorists to their possibility, critically important.  \t\t \t  \t  \t\t\"We've gotten a lot better,\" over the past decade or so, Banacos  says. \"Typically we'll know there's potential two to three days in  advance. And then, down to the level of being able to say precisely what  cities and towns, at what hour, will be impacted, we can get a feel for  that six to 12 hours in advance. That's when we can really pin it down.  \t\t \t  \t  \t\t\"And then once we see the snow squall actually on radar, that's  when we can issue a snow squall warning, and the National Weather  Service meteorologists can go ahead and draw those warnings.\"  \t\t \t  \t  \t\tOnce meteorologists see a snow squall on radar, they issue alerts, including Wireless Emergency Alerts to WEA-capable cellphones in the area. They include a special tone and  vibration, repeated twice, similar to emergency calls like Amber Alerts.  The short message: \"Sudden whiteouts. Icy roads. Slow down!\" The longer  one: \"Slow down or delay travel! Be ready for a sudden drop to near  zero visibility and icy roads in heavy snow.\"  \t\t \t  \t  \t\tExperts advise avoiding travel when a snow squall is forecast. If you're already on the road,  get off as soon as is safely possible. And if you're stuck on a long  stretch of highway when a sudden snow squall descends, the best advice  is to turn on your headlights, leave a lot of room between you and other  vehicles, stay off your brakes if possible to avoid losing control on  the slippery road surface ... and slow the heck down. \t\t\t\t* * * \t\t\t\t\t\t\tA  snow squall might seem like a blizzard when you're in it, and the two  weather phenomena share some qualities. But, according to the NWS, a blizzard has to last at least three hours with snow falling; squalls don't last nearly that long. If winds whip  up existing snow, but with no new falling snow, it's called a ground  blizzard.",

They all had their favorite scripture passages to understand Jesus. Is Jesus God in all the ways the Father is? Nicholas said yes with the majority. They relied on the first chapter of John along with the first chapter of Hebrews. The whole book Isaiah brought forth supporting passages. Nicholas with the others produced the Nicaean Creed, which many of our churches use today.   This summary of the Gospels affirms that Jesus is fully God as is the Father. About ten years later the Church in Rome developed a feast to celebrate the Christ, affirming the teaching that Jesus is truly God. During Pagan Feasts, the Christians gave thanks to the Father for the gift of Jesus the Christ. They celebrated the Christ Mass. The Gospel was John 1, The New Testament was Hebrews 1, and Isaiah represented the Old Testament.   We saw his glory\u2026full of grace and truth.   Isaiah (9,1-6) draws a picture. He sees the people walking in darkness. They lived in a land of gloom. He does not speak of just the one time, when he was writing. He speaks of a great cluster of events through time and across the face of the earth. In the morose, he prophesied a great light that would lead them through the dark valley. He gives many little lights to the people to navigate the shadowy place.   This Christmas, we are in the dark valley. Nature is getting dark. On our inside, we are getting deeper and deeper \u2013 almost North Pole dark. There is a mighty yoke weighing us down. We are being caned by a vicious task master. A plague has been growing around us. One in ten are being affected. We are being decimated. Anxiety grows within. The social order is breaking apart with riots, and political discord. Fires are burning. Hurricanes almost got through the Greek alphabet. Earthquakes being reported in places that do not get earthquakes. Too many are jobless, and more people are hungry. Hospitals are full, the medical staffs are strained.   We saw his glory\u2026full of grace and truth.   Isaiah sees a great light. The glory and truth of the Father penetrates our eyes and lets us see what is hidden. First there is the Wonder-Counselor who is Wisdom, who is the Word of God. There is the God-Hero who has been with God from the beginning and caused creation. There is Father-Forever who makes His dwelling with us and will be our light and life. There is Prince of Peace who sits on the throne of David to establish the Kingdom of God and so the will of God will be done.   Jesus is the Will of God become human. Today we look beyond the crib. We open ourselves to the infinite presence of God. Absorb the love that is your salvation.   We saw his glory\u2026full of grace and truth.   Today we celebrate the fulfillment of the prophet's vision. Today in this dark valley we pledge ourselves to be the light of God and to witness to the love and joy of our God. Here in 2021, we shall shed the chains of self-importance. We will manifest his glory full of grace and truth. We will witness to the dignity of God's glory within each of us, one and all.   The prophesy of Isaiah will be fulfilled again.   Father Lawrence Heiney is pastor of Holy Angels Catholic Church.                 Doug Creamer column: His ways are not our ways - Salisbury Post - Salisbury Post       Posted: 16 Jan 2021 09:00 PM PST   By Doug Creamer   Many of my readers know that I am a snow fanatic. It goes beyond snow, because I love all kinds of weather phenomena. I like to track storms and try to figure out what is going to happen. I study the models and try to draw my own conclusions.   When I was still teaching, I would put my storm predictions out there for my students. I would also predict if we would have a delay or if school would be canceled. I had so much fun and my students looked forward to what I would have to say about approaching storms. They would also have lots to say if I missed it. I would take the ribbing well. I remember a colleague wrote a huge note on my board one day after I missed a prediction. I laughed and left it there all day for my students to see.   I guess I have been fascinated by weather and its unpredictable nature most of my life. My favorite weather memory is when I was in high school. The forecast was for some snow flurries. The flurries started as predicted, but they kept coming, until two days later we had snow drifts taller than houses and buildings. Mother Nature remains unpredictable at times.       The truth is that God can be unpredictable. He says that his ways are not our ways and his thoughts are not our thoughts. Some people falsely believe that God never changes his mind. He told Moses that he was going to destroy the people of Israel, but Moses interceded and God relented. We all know the story of Nineveh. God told Jonah to go and tell them that their city would fall in 40 days. The entire city repented before God, and God showed mercy to the people. I thank God that he does change his mind. Hezekiah was told by the prophet to set his house in order because he was about to die. Hezekiah cried out to God, and before the prophet left the castle God sent him back and granted Hezekiah an additional 15 years.   If it is impossible for God to be influenced or to change his mind, then what is the purpose of prayer? I believe I am a child of God. I also believe that God listens to my prayers. I also expect that God is going to do something about the matters I bring before him. I understand that the answer is \"no\" sometimes. I also understand that tragedies still occur. I understand that there is a real devil whose job it is to steal, kill and destroy.   My job is to keep my eyes on Jesus. I need to listen and obey his voice. When I hear from heaven, I need to make sure that what I hear lines up with scripture and is filled with the love and mercy of God. If I am still unsure about a word I receive, I can call some good friends and my pastor to make sure what I heard resonates in their spirits.   What happens when someone you pray for doesn't get better? What do you do when someone you love gets lost in the world of sex, drugs and alcohol? How do you react when the candidate you voted for doesn't win? What is your response when you didn't get that job you thought God promised you?     When I face disappointment in my life, I fall on my face before God. I remind myself that he is firmly on his throne. Life isn't fair, but God promises to make all things work together for my good. I can lean on my friends and trust that he cares more about my situation than I do. It might be time for that person to go to their heavenly home. I have to remember that God still loves and saves prodigal children. I can pray that God will raise up men and women like Daniel and Esther to advise government leaders. Maybe God closed a door because he has a better one. Maybe he wants you to pursue that entrepreneurial dream that he placed in your heart.   The truth is we don't understand God's ways, or why he changes his mind, or why he allowed something to happen. But I want to encourage you to run to God, not away from him. Turn your worries and pain over to him. Trust his word, that he is on your side and that he will bring good things into your life. Press on. Hang on. Never give up on God. Keep praying. Believe and trust in God.   Contact Doug Creamer at PO Box 777, Faith, NC 28041 or doug@dougcreamer.com .

                "text": "juarakabari.blogspot.com In Birdland, we\u2019ve had heavy fog for about a week. Most of that time, we couldn\u2019t see past the yard. It was as if the world had disappeared, and maybe it had. We didn\u2019t go anywhere to try to find out. The fog came after the ice storm, so trees already laden with ice were bowed down, and the fog crystalized snow right onto the branches. The little row of cedars I planted in my corner meadow were slumped over with the weight. Branches cracked, and we found several large limbs in the yard, succumbing overnight to the pressure. How tragic to see the gash of fresh, healthy wood cut down. Even strong wood cannot withstand strain upon stress. What a time, friends. Our Democracy has been tested before, as it is being tested now. I hope it will survive to be tested in the future. Will the sight of a rampage through the halls of Congress be an epiphany for our nation? I spend a lot of time reading the news, texting to friends. But work doesn\u2019t stop. My deadline for grading won\u2019t change. I grade a little, try to write a letter, contact my representatives in Washington. After the fog lifted, we took the dogs to Lodge Park to walk around and see the sparkle of the ice on the trees. By then, the sun was melting it, and our walk was accompanied by a cracking soundtrack as ice broke away from the branches and rained down on us like hail. We stayed on the road, no ramble down by the river or through the Enchanted Grove today, and luckily, the hail came only in small pieces as the trees shook off their jackets of ice. With the ice came a mist brushing our faces, refreshing in the sun. The park was peaceful, and I was struck with the contrast of our rural existence and the aftermath of what happened in the Capitol. As I sit writing in my cozy office this morning, a fifth victim has died. The violence and terror unleashed by the president seems to me unbelievable and, yet, utterly predictable. How do we find our way out of this, my friends? It will take hard work and courage. If our country survives this (and even if it doesn\u2019t), the only way through is to build community on a very personal level. And how to do that in the time of COVID-19? I\u2019m open to ideas. Reach out to someone who may be struggling. Keep each other safe so we can hang on until our turn for the vaccine comes. Send a letter to a stranger. Send a jar of sourdough to a friend. Here is my plan for when we can gather again: The Stone Soup Garden Collective. Picture this. Once a month in garden time, we meet at a public kitchen, say, our small town Community Center. Everyone brings recipes and whatever is growing in their garden, and we let the vegetables suggest something. For example, in tomato time, we might make a fresh salsa or sauce, or even ketchup if we\u2019re feeling ambitious. When the zucchinis are coming on mercilessly, we\u2019ll bake them into bread and stir them into ratatouille. In the fall, we\u2019ll simmer apple and pumpkin butter. Everyone will take home a share in jars. But why stop with stocking our larders? We can make a potluck of it, everyone bringing one ingredient to stir into soup or to toss together a salad with fresh greens and herbs to share. I picture an all-day festival with people coming and going as they have time. Folks could share family recipes, like my Nanny\u2019s purple eggs or her chicken and noodles. Those who come early could start some bread rising, and though we\u2019d be visiting as we chop and core, slice and cook, we could also have a time for public sharing of stories, songs or poems. Our stone soup would feed our bellies, but the gathering of ideas would feed our souls. My friend, Charlette, laughingly chided me about the sourdough I gave her. Now, with two loaves of bread rising and three jars of sourdough, she feels like Mickey in the Magician\u2019s Apprentice \u2014 the magic broom won\u2019t stop bringing water, so he chops it into pieces, and each shard sprouts a new broom. \u201cIt\u2019s your fault, Mary Hays,\u201d she said. I told her that the whole point of culture is to share it with others. We feed the sourdough fresh flour to grow the culture and keep it healthy, and then we share the surplus. Take heart, my friends. We are in an impossible situation, but we will get through it together. It is dreams like these that give me hope. What are your dreams?

                "text": "Laura Ingalls Wilder\u2019s book, The Long Winter, is set in southeastern Dakota Territory in what is now De Smet, South Dakota, during the severe winter of 1880-1881. In the chapter \u201cAfter the Storm,\u201d Pa Ingalls walked into their cabin after a terrible October blizzard that lasted days. \u201cI got something to show you,\u201d Pa said. He took his hand carefully out of his pocket. \u201cLook here, girls, look at what I found hidden in a haystack.\u201d Slowly he opened his hand. In the hollow of his mitten sat a little bird. He put it gently in Mary\u2019s hands. \u201cWhy, it\u2019s standing straight up!\u201d Mary exclaimed, touching it lightly with her finger-tips.\u00a0 They had never seen a bird like it. It was small, but it looked exactly like the picture of the great auk in Pa\u2019s big green book, \u201cThe Wonders of the Animal World.\u201d\u00a0 It had the same white breast and black back and wings, the same short legs placed far back, and the same large, webbed feet. It stood straight up on its short legs, like a tiny man with black coat and trousers and white shirt front, and its little black wings were like arms.\u00a0 \u201cWhat is it, Pa? Oh, what is it?\u201d Carried cried in delight and she held Grace\u2019s eager hands. \u201cMustn\u2019t touch, Grace.\u201d \u201cI never saw anything like it,\u201d said Pa. \u201cIt must have tired out in the storm winds and dropped down and struck against the haystack. It had crawled into the hay for shelter.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s a great auk,\u201d Laura declared. \u201cOnly it\u2019s a little one.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s full-grown, it isn\u2019t a nestling,\u201d said Ma. \u201cLook at its feathers.\u201d \u201cYes, it\u2019s full-grown, whatever it is,\u201d Pa agreed. The little bird stood up straight on Mary\u2019s soft palm and looked at them all with its bright black eyes.\u00a0 \u201cIt\u2019s never seen a human before,\u201d said Pa.\u00a0 \u201cHow do you know, Pa?\u201d Mary asked.\u00a0 \u201cBecause it isn\u2019t afraid of us,\u201d Pa said.\u00a0 \u201cOh, can we keep it, Pa? Can\u2019t we, Ma?\u201d Carrie begged. \u201cWell, that depends,\u201d Pa said.\u00a0 Mary\u2019s finger-tips touched the little bird all over, while Laura told her how white its smooth breast was and how very black its back and talk and little wings. Then they let Grace carefully touch it. The little auk sat still and looked at them.\u00a0 They set it on the floor and it walked a little way. Then it pushed its webbed feet tiptoe against the boards and flapped its wings.\u00a0 \u201cIt can\u2019t get going,\u201d said Pa. \u201cIt\u2019s a water-bird. It must start from the water where it can use those webbed feet to get up speed.\u201d Finally they put it in a box in the corner. It stood there looking up at them, with its round, bright black eyes and they wondered what it ate.\u00a0 That chapter ends with the family looking at jackrabbits feeding hungrily on their hay and Pa deciding not to shoot them for rabbit stew, but to let them be. They'd all come through that storm together. In the next chapter, \u201cIndian Summer,\u201d we learn more: The little auk would not eat. It did not utter a sound, but Carrie and Laura thought that it looked up at them desperately. It would die without food, but it did not seem to know how to eat anything that they offered it.\u00a0 At dinnertime Pa said that the ice was melting on Silver Lake; he thought that the strange little bird could take care of itself on the open water. So after dinner Laura and Mary put on their coats and hoods and they went with Pa to set the little auk free.\u00a0 Silver Lake was ruffling pale blue and silver under the warm, pale sky. Ice was round its edges and flat gray cakes of ice floated on the ripples. Pa took the little auk from his pocket. In its smooth black coat and neat white shirt-front of tiny feathers, it stood up on his palm. It saw the land and the sky and the water, and eagerly it rose up on its toes and stretched out its little wings.\u00a0 But it could not go, it could not fly. Its wings were too small to lift it.\u00a0 \u201cIt does not belong on land,\u201d said Pa. \u201cIt\u2019s a water-bird.\u201d He squatted down by the thin white ice at the lake\u2019s edge and reaching far out he tipped the little bird from his hand into the blue water. For the briefest instant, there it was, and then it wasn\u2019t there. Out among the ice cakes it went streaking, a black speck.\u00a0 \u201cIt gets up speed, with his webbed feet,\u201d said Pa, \u201cto lift it from the\u2026There it goes!\u201d Laura barely had time to see it, rising tiny in the great blue-sparkling sky. Then, in all that glittering of sunlight, it was gone. Her eyes were too dazzled to see it any more. But Pa stood looking, still seeing it going toward the South. They never knew what became of that strange little bird that came in the dark with the storm from the far North and went southward in the sunshine. They never saw nor heard of another bird like it. They never found out what kind of bird it was.\u00a0 Laura Ingalls Wilder\u2019s description, including the important details that the bird was tiny enough to fit in Pa\u2019s pocket and its black back and wings and white front, makes me wonder if the bird could have been a Dovekie, which ranges from the Arctic through the north Atlantic coast. South Dakota has no records of Dovekies, but Wisconsin has two records, one shot by two boys hunting along Lake Michigan in 1908, and one found dead under some Tomah power lines in 1949. That one had only a small piece of quartz in its stomach. Single Dovekie specimens have also been taken from Wabana Lake near Grand Rapids, Minnesota, in November 1962 and Lake of the Woods in November 1931.\u00a0 The other, probably more likely, possibility is that it was an Ancient Murrelet. South Dakota has one record, from November 1993, of a poor bird discovered in Ipswich, in the north-central part of the state, after a snow storm that had originated in the North Pacific. The bird died soon after it was found. Dan Tallman, who prepared the carcass for a museum specimen at the U.S. National Museum, wrote in his blog, \u201cI have never encountered a more emaciated bird.\u201d Wisconsin has at least five records of Ancient Murrelet, and Minnesota at least seven.\u00a0 Anyway, thoughts of Laura Ingalls Wilder immediately came to mind when I read a text message this morning that Steve Kolbe had found an Ancient Murrelet at Stoney Point up the shore between Duluth and Two Harbors. I instantly loaded up my car with my camera, binoculars, face mask, and coat, and the moment I could break away, I headed up to see it. The poor thing is almost certainly doomed\u2014oceanic birds simply don\u2019t have much chance of surviving long in fresh water, with food entirely different from what they have experience eating. But such a cosmically rare bird so close to home seemed worth chasing. A tragic truth about birders is that we really do relish seeing rare birds. I try to temper that lust for the list, especially when it involves either wasting a lot of fossil fuels or looking for a bird who is clearly suffering, but hope is the thing with feathers, and this bird was still diving and popping up. I made it to Stoney Point a little more than an hour after Steve Kolbe first reported it. A dozen cars were parked where I\u2019d sort of expected from the text message to find it, but I didn\u2019t see any birders and there were two or three houses on the far side, so I figured someone might be having a gathering and kept driving. Kim Eckert was at the next collection of cars and told me that Bill Penning, down on the rocky shore, had his scope on it so I scurried down. I was wearing the shoes I wear when working at my desk treadmill\u2014I hadn\u2019t thought to change into something more suitable\u2014but I got through just fine. The bird was a barely visible speck in the distance through my binoculars, when I finally got a glimpse, but that was after Bill lowered his scope for me to get a pretty good look. My camera was worthless at that distance, but those cars I\u2019d passed apparently did belong to birders, so I headed there next, where I got my photos.\u00a0   On my way to see it at the first spot, I told a young couple walking their dog about it, mentioning the Laura Ingalls Wilder connection, and they thought that was fascinating. I passed them again after I\u2019d seen it, and they were thrilled for me. Birding is of course always about birds\u2014the ones we see and hear, and the ones we yearn to see and hear. But it\u2019s about more than that, too. The birding community can be competitive and contentious but it\u2019s a genuine community, and I\u2019ve missed the camaraderie of birders during this horrible pandemic. It was lovely to chat for a minute with my treasured friend Greg Garmer, and I got to say hi to several more friends, all of us drawn to one little spot on a great big lake to get a brief glimpse at a lost little creature.\u00a0 This sighting gave me even more than that tick on my list and the opportunity to connect with friends. It also gave me a sense of connection with Laura Ingalls Wilder herself, the woman whose books so enriched my childhood and were so enjoyable to read aloud to my own children. So I\u2019m feeling a great deal of gratitude today, even as I\u2019m hoping against hope that that little bird figures out how to get enough food out of Lake Superior to fuel up for a long journey home. Godspeed, little one.",

                "text": "A tale of two maps.\u00a0 First one: What the National Weather Service office in South Burlington was forecasting on Friday for the just -completed snowstorm:    Next map. What actually happened. A really good forecast. My thoughts below the second map:\u00a0  You can tell by the maps what a degree or two difference can do to a forecast, though. The forecasts were great, but somewhat less snow than predicted fell in the Northeast Kingdom and in northeastern New York.\u00a0 In both places, but the Northeast Kingdom in particular, temperatures held just\u00a0 a couple degrees higher than many people forecast. The track of the storm was essentially up the Connecticut River Valley. That let in just enough warm air to keep things Saturday in most of the Northeast Kingdom rain or a rain/snow mixture. The Northeast Kingdom still got snow, but perhaps two or three inches less than forecast. Still, people in the Northeast Kingdom shouldn't feel too bad. There was snow on the ground there before this storm hit, and they squeaked out a couple to a few inches more this weekend. It was still snowing lightly there Sunday afternoon.\u00a0 Plus, if anybody gets snow from some weak systems this coming week, it will probably include the northeastern part of Vermont.\u00a0 Snow cover through that area, and most of Vermont, is still below normal for this time of year. But at least it's no longer pathetic.",

That\u2019s what I told myself while I was stranded at the hotel bar in the middle of a snow storm. I thought indulging in a night of passion with the good-looking detective would be a great idea. I couldn\u2019t have been more wrong. \u00a0 Apparently, seeing him again was inevitable, especially when fate kept putting him in my path.  I didn\u2019t have time for a relationship. I had a business to run and obligations to honor. But as it \u00a0turned out, resisting him required more restraint than the set of handcuffs that brought us together in the first place.  I convinced myself that it was the perfect arrangement. He wasn\u2019t looking for a commitment and I wasn\u2019t in a position to give him one. That was already promised to someone else.  We might have agreed to keep things simple, but sometimes rules are destined to be broken.  He told me he would give me Whatever I Need. How can I bring myself to tell him what I need is for him to let me go?",

                "title": "Can work-at-home cure California traffic jams?",
                "text": "A rare positive of the pandemic era has been the dramatic reduction in California\u2019s infamous traffic congestion. That\u2019s what recessions do. Fewer jobs, fewer commutes. Right? Well, 2020 was an economic oddity for many reasons. The stay-at-home mentality promoted to slowing the spread of coronavirus also impacted how many folks were on the road. And since remote working likely will endure past the pandemic\u2019s end, its ability to cut congestion \u2014 and perhaps investments in transportation infrastructure spending \u2014 looks intriguing. My trusty spreadsheet tells me that last year\u2019s traffic improvements in the Bay Area outpaced Southern California. That\u2019s due more to the two region\u2019s varying job types, not job losses. To calculate commuting rankings, I compared traffic and employment stats using data on traffic jams in 57 big U.S. cities from navigation gear maker TomTom, November unemployment data in those markets, and how they fared in a study of metro-area workforces and their potential to work remotely by Outdoorsy, a recreation vehicle rental app. Ponder what I learned about San Jose vs. the Inland Empire, two job hubs near big cities. Curiously, both had congestion woes 19% of the time in 2020, ranking fifth-highest among the 57 markets tracked. But San Jose\u2019s 2020 traffic was 42% less congested vs. 2019 \u2014 the second-largest drop. Riverside congestion was down 27%, the 20th smallest decline. It probably wasn\u2019t the scale of job losses that explains the difference between these two suburban areas. The San Jose area\u2019s unemployment was 5.1% \u2014 up 113% in a year. Riverside was at 7.9%, also up 113%. Leaving California? Here\u2019s a ranking of the best states \u00a0for relocation.So, consider instead the hot industries in the two regions. San Jose is a tech hub and very friendly to remote work. Riverside is all about logistics, which is nearly impossible to do from home. In fact, warehousing and shipping help to power stay-at-home life. In the San Jose market, it\u2019s estimated 48.5% of jobs can be done remotely \u2014 No. 1 among these 57 cities studied for congestion. Riverside? Just 29.6% of folks have work-for-home potential \u2014 tied for last with Grand Rapids, Mich., a historic factory town known as \u201cFurniture City.\u201d Bigger trendA somewhat similar pattern was found in the nearby big cities. San Francisco traffic was 21% congested in 2020 \u2014 with 42% fewer delays in a year, the No. 5 drop. Los Angeles was congested 27% of the time \u2014 still No. 1 nationally even after traffic improved 36%. That drop ranked No. 12 out of 57. The improvement gap between these giant, urban employment hubs can\u2019t be unemployment. Yes, the jumps in rates exceeded their suburban neighbor\u2019s joblessness but they were remarkably similar. San Francisco\u2019s jobless rate was 6.1% \u2014 up 154% in a year while L.A.\u2019s rate rose 153% to 9.6%. Next, look at remote-work potential. In tech-heavy San Francisco, 43% of jobs are work-from-home ready, the third-highest share of the 57. In Los Angeles \u2014 with an economy filled with in-person work such as hospitality, port and factory jobs \u2014 37% of workers can potentially work from home, ranking No. 23 of 57. No local oddityThis gap is not just some north-south California quirk. Let\u2019s look at what my spreadsheet told me when I divided the 57 cities into three groupings, ranked by drops in 2020 congestion. Joblessness didn\u2019t matter. Sign up for The Home Stretch email newsletter filled with housing news from the region! Subscribe here.The 19 cities with the biggest traffic drops \u2014 down 39% on average \u2014 had an average unemployment jump of 102% to 5.8%. Joblessness in 19 cities with the smallest congestion improvements \u2014 averaging 23% \u2014 rose 104% to 6.8%. However, work-from-home differed. The big traffic declines came in markets averaging 39% of jobs with remote potential. The smallest congestion improvements were in towns in which 34% of jobs had work-from-home possibilities. Hopefully, many questions raised during pandemic life will be studied once the health crisis is over.

                "text": "good-things-do-happen-dean: merry, merry christmas to @theta8 from your destiel secret santa!!!! here\u2019s some domestic fluff(y snow) for you <3 thanks to @destielsecretsanta2020 for putting this together! snowfall | destiel | 908 wordsOkay, so maybe he\u2019s being a little overly cautious, Dean realizes as he takes in the sight of Cas essentially waddling up the stairs to the door. But hell, it\u2019s the first snow of the year, the first snow since Cas became human, and Dean doesn\u2019t want him to lose any of his freshly human fingers or toes. Or something. Plus, he\u2019s always freezing in the Bunker, pulling on extra sweaters and double pairs of socks. Still, maybe the blanket-sized scarf wound under, over, and around the puffy jacket zipped to Cas\u2019s chin was a bit much. Especially with the bright blue earmuffs poking out from the lumpy hand-knitted hat Claire sent him. All that\u2019s really visible is the tip of Cas\u2019s nose poking out from the folds of his scarf. \u201cDean,\u201d Cas says, his voice muffled by layers of down and wool. \u201cIt isn\u2019t funny.\u201d He wobbles a little on the landing and Dean grabs a mittened hand to steady him, tipping his head back and laughing. \u201cDon\u2019t move,\u201d Dean says, wiping at his eyes with his free hand. He grins as Cas\u2019s hat scrunches in a way that probably means he\u2019s frowning, and pulls out his phone to snap a picture for Claire before realizing he\u2019s still holding Cas\u2019s hand. That\u2019s allowed now, but it\u2019s new and still makes Dean\u2019s stomach flutter a little. \u201cHere,\u201d he says quietly, reaching for the hat to fold it up and out of Cas\u2019s eyes. He lets his fingers linger there, smoothing the hair away from Cas\u2019s forehead, then sliding down to stroke over his cheek. He can just\u2026reach out and touch Cas now. And Cas could do the same, if he was able to move his arms. Dean snaps a couple of photos of Cas alone for Claire, then leans into the frame to tilt their heads together. He doesn\u2019t resist the urge to press a quick kiss to what little of Cas\u2019s cheek is exposed to the air. (He gets a picture of that too, to set as his lockscreen photo later, which changes about every other day since Cas is always doing something photo-worthy and cute.) \u201cReady?\u201d  he asks, taking Cas\u2019s hand in his once more. Cas squeezes his hand once in response, not even bothering to mumble something through his many layers. \u201cOkay, then.\u201d There\u2019s a rush of bitterly cold air when Dean opens the front door, even though they\u2019re still technically underground. The stairs up to the ground level are clear, thanks to some sort of Bunker-magic Dean has never really understood, but is eternally grateful for. No matter the weather, the stairs leading from the road to the front door stay clean and dry. Good thing too, that way Dean doesn\u2019t have to worry about Cas slipping on a wet step and breaking his newly-human neck. Not that Cas is clumsy at all, anything but, really. He moves with grace instead of Grace, like a dancer, carefully considering each step. That certainly is the case when they reach the top of the stairs, still hand in hand. Cas gasps audibly at the sight of the perfect layer of snow blanketing the ground. The only blemish is the tire tracks leading from the garage to the road from when Sam left for a last-minute grocery run an hour or so ago, in case the storm got any worse. \u201cDean.\u201d Cas tugs his scarf away from his mouth and pushes his hat out of his eyes to gaze at the sight, turning in a tight circle at the top of the stairs. \u201cIt\u2019s\u2014\u201c It is. The thick layer of snow on the ground is still soft and fluffy, still bright and clean and unblemished. Everything is hushed, even Dean\u2019s heavy boots make a shush-shush sound as he steps out further into the snow. It\u2019s just starting to flurry again, delicate flakes drifting to settle on the ground. If Jack, Sam, and Eileen were here, they\u2019d probably make a snowman, or have a vicious vigorous snowball fight. There would be tackling to the ground and handfuls of snow shoved down the backs of shirts until they all traipsed back inside, freezing and red-cheeked from the cold and from laughter. Sam would peel off his hat and shake his wet hair out all over Dean before Eileen whacked him gently with a towel (then did the same to him). But they\u2019ll save that for another time because it\u2019s just Dean and Cas today, and Cas seems content to just tip his head skyward and watch as the snow falls quietly around them. And Dean is content to shove his hands in his jacket pockets and watch Cas watch the snow from a few steps away. After a while, Cas looks at Dean and grins broadly, which Dean takes as his cue to shush-shush back over to him. He laughs a little, cupping Cas\u2019s cheek with one hand. \u201cYou\u2019ve got snowflakes in your lashes, y\u2019know.\u201d Cas lets his eyes flutter closed slowly, smile turning into something gentle and fond and trusting. Dean thumbs under each eyelid carefully, then tips his forehead against Cas\u2019s and closes his eyes too. Mittened hands come up and cover his where they rest on Cas\u2019s cheeks. They share breath for a moment, a minute, maybe longer as snow settles in their hair, on their shoulders. \u201cI love you,\u201d Cas says simply. And, in this frozen moment, Dean says, \u201cI love you too, Cas.\u201d",

                "text": "Hello everyone and Happy Sunday!\u00a0 All is good with us and we had a nice week. The weather was beautiful and mild. We went for lots of walks and soaked up as much of the sun as we could. Yesterday, we woke up to the start of a nice little snow storm. We got a sizeable dump of wet, heavy snow. I quickly realized in the morning that shovelling paths in the backyard was out of the question...so my snowshoes came to the rescue! It was a very good workout and it did the job. I have to say that snowshoeing was much easier on my ticker than shovelling.\u00a0 I went to bed last night and my last thought before I fell asleep was...tomorrow I will build a snowman. It was a fun way to spend a Sunday morning. Cooper & Spicy were right there with me and Russell took photos. I wasn't sure what to use for the eyes and mouth. In the end, I used some dried potpourri oranges and berries that I found in the basement. In hindsight, I should have thought about how to decorate my snowman before I built it...perhaps I would have been more creative \ud83d\ude04Maybe next time. We got ourselves an air fryer. It arrived on Friday. Thanks to our neighbour Paul for the recommendation! I haven't had a chance to use it yet but I plan on doing so this week. Something different. On the Netflix front, I settled on two new series: Virgin River and How to get away with Murder. Both are very different and very good. Virgin River is less intense that the Murder one so I've been alternating between both depending on my mood. This afternoon will be a Virgin River kind of day. This coming week will be sunny but colder. Tomorrow, Cooper has a vet appointment for his monthly B12 injection as well as to have his anal gland checked. It seemed to have healed very nicely. Next week, he goes back to the internist for more blood work. He's a busy little fellow. On Wednesday, we will be glued to the TV to watch the Biden/Harris inauguration. It's been a long time coming. We've been watching Biden's various addresses, what a breath of fresh air he is. On Friday, our friend Nathan (from Talemaker Camp) will have major heart surgery. We are sending him and Darlah positive vibes. He will be in our thoughts.\u00a0 That's my blog for today. Russell has a couple of good football games to watch. It's that time of year, exciting playoffs. Have a great week everyone. Stay well and healthy!  Admiring our work of art, I think it's a pretty cute snowman    After a final sniff and walk around, they\u00a0 approve - job well done and fun! Here is our happy potpourri faced snowman in  his finest, wearing Russell's hat. When the snow is wet and heavy...snowshoes to\u00a0 the rescue. The pooches need their paths. Cooper and Spicy enjoyed a little deck time under the awning while watching me tamp down the snow. Good load of snow on the roof. The little pier at Edgewater Park in Pointe Claire on Friday. A bright sunny day makes the frigid water of Lake St. Louis shimmer...if you look closely you will see a flock of birds in flight.",

                "title": "Junkyard Gem: 1970 Audi 100LS",
                "text": "While Americans could buy new cars made by Audi ancestors DKW and NSU during the 1950s and 1960s (few did so), the Audi story as we know it here really began in 1969, when the 1970 100LS went on sale in the United States. The 100LS remained on sale through 1976 and gained a small-but-devoted American following, and I try my best to find discarded examples during my junkyard travels. This has been a difficult task, with just a lone \u201976 sedan appearing before my camera during the past decade or so. Last week, though, I found this extremely rare first-model-year 100LS in a yard northeast of Denver. \n \nNote that the company name was \u201cAudi NSU Auto Union\u201d at the time of this car\u2019s manufacture; that\u2019s what Volkswagen\u2019s bosses named it after the 1969 acquisition of NSU, and the name stuck until the company became just Audi AG in the 1980s. Date of manufacture was April of 1970, around the time when the Baader-Meinhoff Group was stirring up trouble in West Germany. \n \nBob Hagestad ran a Porsche/Audi dealership on Colfax Avenue in Denver, became well-known as a Colorado 924 racer, and went on to sell Volkswagens in Texas.\u00a0 \n \nThis car appears to have been well-cared-for during its first couple of decades, at which point it ended up spending many years sitting outdoors in the harsh High Plains climate. Much of the paint has been burned off its upper surfaces and there\u2019s rust-through from many years of winter snow buildup. \n \nThe once-luxurious interior has been irradiated into a dust-billowing crispiness. \n \nAs so often happens with cars stored outdoors for long periods here, rodents made their nests in the passenger and engine compartments. You need to be careful with mouse-poop-filled cars like this in Colorado boneyards, because hantavirus is a genuinely lethal danger here. I\u2019ve seen worse rodent-poop cars than this, though \u2014 much worse. \n \nThe 1.8-liter engine all the way at the front of the engine compartment made 115 horsepower when new, which was pretty good power for 1970. \n \nThe four-on-the-floor manual was still state-of-the-art in 1970, with most Detroit three-pedal cars still running three-on-the-trees. The final new four-speed manual car available in the United States hit the showrooms when this Audi was a quarter-century old, so this type of transmission remained relevant for quite a while. The 100LS got an optional automatic transmission starting in 1971, and it cost $200 extra (about $1,310 in 2021 dollars). \n \nThe shift diagram built into a standard VDO gauge housing is a nice touch. \n \nThese VDO/Kienzle clocks went into millions of European cars over the decades. \n \nThis Emden AM/FM radio was an $85 option. That\u2019s about $555 in present-day bucks, but absolutely necessary if you wanted to listen to the hits of 1970 with the required fidelity. \n \nSo how much was the entire car? MSRP on the two-door 100LS sedan came to $3,695, or about $25,450 in 2021 dollars. Meanwhile, the bigger and flashier 1970 Buick Gran Sport hardtop coupe cost just $3,283, and that included a 455-cubic-inch (7.5-liter) V8 rated at 350 horsepower. An American car shopper had to be something of a devoted Europhile to choose a new Audi in 1970 (in that case, though, the $2,982 BMW 2002 would have been tough to resist). \n \nI hope some Colorado 100LS restorers extract some usable parts off this car before it faces the cold steel jaws of the crusher! \n \nLike having a Rolls-Royce Silver Shadow, Mercedes-Benz 280SE, and a Cadillac Eldorado\u00a0all at the same time! \n\n \n \nFile source \nThe post Junkyard Gem: 1970 Audi 100LS appeared first on Times News Express.",

                "title": "Can work-at-home cure California traffic jams?",
                "text": "A rare positive of the pandemic era has been the dramatic reduction in California\u2019s infamous traffic congestion. That\u2019s what recessions do. Fewer jobs, fewer commutes. Right? Well, 2020 was an economic oddity for many reasons. The stay-at-home mentality promoted to slowing the spread of coronavirus also impacted how many folks were on the road. And since remote working likely will endure past the pandemic\u2019s end, its ability to cut congestion \u2014 and perhaps investments in transportation infrastructure spending \u2014 looks intriguing. My trusty spreadsheet tells me that last year\u2019s traffic improvements in the Bay Area outpaced Southern California. That\u2019s due more to the two region\u2019s varying job types, not job losses. To calculate commuting rankings, I compared traffic and employment stats using data on traffic jams in 57 big U.S. cities from navigation gear maker TomTom, November unemployment data in those markets, and how they fared in a study of metro-area workforces and their potential to work remotely by Outdoorsy, a recreation vehicle rental app. Ponder what I learned about San Jose vs. the Inland Empire, two job hubs near big cities. Curiously, both had congestion woes 19% of the time in 2020, ranking fifth-highest among the 57 markets tracked. But San Jose\u2019s 2020 traffic was 42% less congested vs. 2019 \u2014 the second-largest drop. Riverside congestion was down 27%, the 20th smallest decline. It probably wasn\u2019t the scale of job losses that explains the difference between these two suburban areas. The San Jose area\u2019s unemployment was 5.1% \u2014 up 113% in a year. Riverside was at 7.9%, also up 113%. Leaving California? Here\u2019s a ranking of the best states \u00a0for relocation.So, consider instead the hot industries in the two regions. San Jose is a tech hub and very friendly to remote work. Riverside is all about logistics, which is nearly impossible to do from home. In fact, warehousing and shipping help to power stay-at-home life. In the San Jose market, it\u2019s estimated 48.5% of jobs can be done remotely \u2014 No. 1 among these 57 cities studied for congestion. Riverside? Just 29.6% of folks have work-for-home potential \u2014 tied for last with Grand Rapids, Mich., a historic factory town known as \u201cFurniture City.\u201d Bigger trendA somewhat similar pattern was found in the nearby big cities. San Francisco traffic was 21% congested in 2020 \u2014 with 42% fewer delays in a year, the No. 5 drop. Los Angeles was congested 27% of the time \u2014 still No. 1 nationally even after traffic improved 36%. That drop ranked No. 12 out of 57. The improvement gap between these giant, urban employment hubs can\u2019t be unemployment. Yes, the jumps in rates exceeded their suburban neighbor\u2019s joblessness but they were remarkably similar. San Francisco\u2019s jobless rate was 6.1% \u2014 up 154% in a year while L.A.\u2019s rate rose 153% to 9.6%. Next, look at remote-work potential. In tech-heavy San Francisco, 43% of jobs are work-from-home ready, the third-highest share of the 57. In Los Angeles \u2014 with an economy filled with in-person work such as hospitality, port and factory jobs \u2014 37% of workers can potentially work from home, ranking No. 23 of 57. No local oddityThis gap is not just some north-south California quirk. Let\u2019s look at what my spreadsheet told me when I divided the 57 cities into three groupings, ranked by drops in 2020 congestion. Joblessness didn\u2019t matter.

Subscribe here.The 19 cities with the biggest traffic drops \u2014 down 39% on average \u2014 had an average unemployment jump of 102% to 5.8%. Joblessness in 19 cities with the smallest congestion improvements \u2014 averaging 23% \u2014 rose 104% to 6.8%. However, work-from-home differed. The big traffic declines came in markets averaging 39% of jobs with remote potential. The smallest congestion improvements were in towns in which 34% of jobs had work-from-home possibilities. Hopefully, many questions raised during pandemic life will be studied once the health crisis is over.

                "text": "I woke late this morning (really one morning a couple of weeks ago) and looked out to see a dog dancing around on some white stuff. It took a moment to realize the white stuff was snow. I dressed, took my camera, and headed out to document the event. \nThe first time I saw snow I was five years old. Dr. Luckett was at the house to see my mother, who\u2019d come down with the flu. My father asked if he could wrap me up and take me outside, but the doctor said no, it wouldn\u2019t be a good idea. I spent most of October through April with a chronic sinus infection, tonsillitis, and a raging fever, and going out into the cold might start things up again. \nI haven\u2019t seen much snow since. In 1985, I believe it was, fifty miles south of Austin, we ended up with about twelve inches of snow packed and iced over. I felt so sorry for the cardinals swooping down and finding nothing to eat that I threw an entire box of Bran Buds across the ice. Tramp, my terrier, walked around licking up the cereal while I called to him to stop that. His Sweet Babboo, the neighbors\u2019 pit bull, Becky, stood beside me on the porch, wishing she could lick the yard, too. When you told Becky not to do something, she obeyed, mostly. Tramp did pretty much as he pleased. \nCardinals\u2019 beaks might not be designed to eat Bran Buds, but I didn\u2019t think about that. My beak isn\u2019t designed to eat them either. \nIn 2000, David and I spent Christmas in Maryland, and I learned what it felt like to walk through the woods, kicking my way through white powder. It was beautiful. \nIt was still snowing when I got outside that morning but the white stuff was quickly turning to slush, and before I could get back inside, what had started as flakes sifting onto my hair turned into wet plops. \nBut here is one little event of Austin in January 2021. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA good ice storm is prettier than snow, much more impressive, but I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve seen one of those since the \u201970s when I had four impacted wisdom teeth removed, and I could have done without it then.",

                "text": "When last we I spoke, I mentioned a wind storm that was bearing down on us. Turned out to be every bit as wild as predicted. The winds arrived Wednesday evening and blew nonstop for almost 48 hours. Sustained winds between 50-60 mph with gusts to 81 mph in Rapid City. That\u2019s equivalent to a Category 1 hurricane! It was brutal, and caused some damage around town. These aren\u2019t my photos, but give you a pretty good idea of the aftermath. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe worst part was trying to sleep. I ended up on the couch Wednesday night \u2014 not because I was in the doghouse with my wife, but rather, the living room is more protected from the wind than our west-facing bedroom, where every gust was whistling through the eaves and shaking the house. Wind is a fact of life around here, but the duration of this event was unusual.  \n\n\n\nWe were glad those winds died down Friday afternoon, because we had weekend plans that were half outdoors/half indoors. Saturday, we ventured down to Custer for the Burning Beetle Festival. We went last year and had such a blast, we decided to make it an annual tradition. You can follow the link if you want more details about the event. In a nutshell, the city of Custer sets fire to a mountain pine beetle effigy placed atop discarded Christmas trees every January. This year, they got creative and added spiky COVID viruses to the beetle. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe got to town mid-afternoon and settled into the Buglin\u2019 Bull, a restaurant and sports bar on the main drag, for cocktails and appetizers while waiting for sundown. It was a virtual repeat of last year, right down to the food (chislic and stuffed mushrooms) and drinks (Old Fashioneds for me, beer for Tara).  \n\n\n\nWhen we first got to town, the sun was shining brightly. \u201cI would love to see it snow one year,\u201d Tara said wistfully. \n\n\n\nLittle did we know she\u2019d get her wish\u2026 \n\n\n\nWe tabbed out at 4:30 and checked into the Super 8. Once again history repeated itself, because it was the same place we stayed last year. That had been such a fun weekend, we figured, why mess with perfection? \n\n\n\nWe arrived at Pageant Hill at 5:00, just as twilight was settling in. By then, some ominous-looking clouds had rolled in. Right about the time the torch-carrying mob crested the hill, it started snowing. Like, really coming down hard. Which created a great atmosphere!  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s really something to see a group of people chanting \u201cburn, beetle, burn!\u201d while a drummer bangs away before lighting the whole thing on fire. Definitely a unique experience, especially for South Dakota.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI finally bit the bullet and upgraded to a premium plan so I can share video. It\u2019s something I\u2019ve wanted to do for a long time. Plus, no more ads, and unlimited access to premium themes. Totally worth it! But I digress.  \n\n\n\nThe beetle burning was accompanied by a fireworks display, too. I was so caught up in the moment, I forgot to be cold.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter the beetle had pretty much burned itself down to ashes, we picked up a pizza and returned to the room. We\u2019d brought along a cooler of drinks and kicked back for a little while before heading down to the pool and hot tub. Tara\u2019s coworker Chelsea and her boyfriend and roommate were also in town for the festival, as they were last year (deja vu x3), and came down to join us. We ended up killing a couple of hours down there, only leaving when management reminded us that the pool had technically closed 15 minutes earlier. Oops.  \n\n\n\nWe checked out of the motel this morning and I suggested we take the scenic drive back to town down Highway 44. \u201cGreat idea!\u201d Tara said. And it was\u2026at least in theory. The road was very icy and slick after the previous evening\u2019s snowfall, which made for a white-knuckle drive. We hadn\u2019t anticipated that, but got home without sliding off the road. Whew. \n\n\n\nHope your weekend was as fun as ours!",

My storm glass (a Christmas gift from one of my  sisters-of-the-heart) has looked pretty much like this since the day I  set it out. The crystals in the bottom indicate \"thick air\" and/or  frost, and have increased or decreased only slightly on any given day in  the last month. A mixture of ammonium chloride, potassium nitrate, camphor, ethanol and distilled water, the storm glass was commonly used by mariners in the latter part of the 1800s. The appearance of the liquid is largely a reflection of current conditions, but is also affected by changes in barometric pressure and notable variations in temperature. To that extent, it can predict incoming storms with a certain degree of reliability. I'm still waiting for it to display flakes or small stars, indicating there's snow coming soon.",

                "text": "I mentioned that some posts may have some later thoughts added to them. Well, here\u2019s the first one. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShaylyn\u2019s accident occurred on a Saturday, so the first full day spent at the hospital was a Sunday. That Sunday morning brought with it a snowstorm. It\u2019s not unheard of for us to see snow in October, but it\u2019s also not always the norm. I couldn\u2019t help but think that Shaylyn would be mad she missed the first real snowstorm of the season and it made me a little sad. \n\n\n\nEric and I decided to have lunch in the cafeteria. Really neither one of us ate much, but we got enough in our systems to function somewhat. While walking to the cafeteria I just remember being so cold. A feeling I\u2019d have throughout the month. Looking back now, I was probably in shock.  \n\n\n\nThe cafeteria seemed a dismal, gloomy place. Because it was a Sunday, it wasn\u2019t all that busy. Also, Covid kept hospital visitors down. They were doing work outside the hospital cafeteria \u2013 making a courtyard or something similar and I just kept wishing it was warmer weather and that the courtyard was actually done because I needed the sun. \n\n\n\nAll around the cafeteria there is positive signage. Famous sayings like: \n\n\n\n\u201cLife isn\u2019t about waiting for the\u00a0storm\u00a0to pass, its about learning how to\u00a0dance in\u00a0the rain.\u201d \n\n\n\nThere would be days I\u2019d hate seeing them because there seemed to be nothing good going on, but there were also days where they were just what I needed to see. \n\n\n\nMy little sister called while we were eating that first afternoon. She didn\u2019t want to bother us but had some questions about things happening back at home. I was happy to have the distraction though it was hard to talk to her and make decisions about the other kids and everyday life. I just kept thinking, \u201cHow is this my life right now?\u201d \n\n\n\nI was thankful for my mom and sisters. They jumped right in and took care of things at home. While at our home they had a prayer with the kids. My sister would later tell me that after this prayer Lex would say, \u201cWhen I saw the snow this morning, I took it as a sign. Shaylyn will be okay.\u201d \n\n\n\nShaylyn has loved the snow since she was little. She\u2019s always been eager to get out there and build a snowman and as she got older a snow fort. I was always amazed at how long she could stay in the snow, even as a little girl.",

                "text": "The storm that brought all the rain, wind and snow Saturday, is still impacting New England this afternoon. The storm center has stalled in southeastern Canada and is causing heavy snow at our mountains once again, but a good amount of sunshine toward the coast with windy conditions. \n\n\n\nTemperatures Sunday are not too cold for this time of year though, in the 30s north and low 40s south. We have a nice crescent moon in the evening sky with temperatures only slowly falling into the 30s south and 20s north for lows. \n\n\n\nOur Martin Luther King Jr. Day looks similar to today, with plenty of sunshine toward the coast, and mountain snow showers continuing. A little less windy, and a tad less cold with high temperatures in the 30s north, and in the low 40s south. A cold front may generate a snow shower all the way to southern New England later tomorrow, then colder air comes in for the rest of the 10-day forecast. \n\n\n\nTuesday looks bright with plenty of sunshine for most, high temperatures in the 20s to low 30s. A sharp cold front comes in Tuesday night with a few snow showers or a snow squall, leading to a windy and cold Wednesday with temperatures in the teens north and 20s south. Another front like that comes through Thursday night with a chance of some more snow showers and sets up a pretty cold looking \u2014 but mostly storm free \u2014 weekend.  \n\n\n\nThe next significant storm threat may be near the end of our First Alert 10-day forecast, a week from Tuesday.",

                "text": "Published 1/17/21 Sunday 12:45 pm \nYesterday, I mentioned that the Euro run was an outlier to the other models. Since then the Euro has come roaring back to life. The GFS and Canadian looked convincing all day and night until this morning\u2019s latest runs, where they have backed off of their totals by taking the storm further south. It is interesting that the Euro did the same thing 24 hours ago. I have a lot of model data to share today so I am just going to stick with the liquid totals. Multiply the numbers for your location by 12 to convert the liquid to snow accumulation. Every model is calling for snow beginning between midnight and 3 am Tuesday morning. Some of the models are more aggressive, I am already anxious to see tomorrow\u2019s model runs. I do expect (at least) Winter Weather Advisories to be issued within the next day. \nI was delighted to see the changes in the Euro so here are the last two runs. \nOvernight Euro run \n \nThis morning\u2019s Euro run \n \nThis may look a little different because it is from a different weather model provider. This provider separates the airport total from Durango downtown. If the Euro is correct the southern portion of the forecast area will get some better snow than they have so far. \nNext up, a model I don\u2019t usually show but it is an American short-term model. I look at it when I see the GFS suddenly diverges from one run to the next. \nThis morning\u2019s NAM12km (low-resolution) model. \n \nHere are the last two runs from the Canadian model. \nCanadian last night \n \nCanadian this morning \n \nAs I said the Canadian took a more southern track this morning. \nHere are the last two runs from the GFS. \nGFS overnight \n \nGFS this morning \n \nJust like with the Canadian model, the GFS takes the southern track with this morning\u2019s run. \nThe last model is the high-resolution WPC model. WPC stands for NOAA\u2019s Weather Prediction Center. This is one of NOAA\u2019s in house blended models. \n \nI am not too concerned with the latest pull back from the GFS and Canadian. As I said earlier, all models are predicting snow accumulation. At the moment it appears areas from Purgatory to the south will be favored for this storm. This storm has some potential for my followers in Aztec and Bloomington. \nMy next Update will be Monday, thanks for following and supporting the page! \nClick here to donate\nClick here to contact",

This front will be the primary focal point for convection to develop this afternoon. Several showers and thunderstorms have already developed around the southern Ravalli county [the county of the Bitterroot] and into the Butte/Anaconda area. A few of these storms could  become strong this afternoon and evening with the potential of heavy rain, gusty winds, and hail. The strongest storms are anticipated to be east of the Continental Divide. Also, northwest Montana could experience a few showers and thunderstorms this evening, but they will not be as strong as the storms in the southwestern portion of the state.\n\nThe low pressure system is still on track to impact the Northern Rockies Sunday through Tuesday. The band of heaviest precipitation will develop over southern Idaho county, Lemhi county and up into southwest Montana Sunday afternoon. Models have this band holding its location through Sunday evening into the early morning hours. The band starts to move northward throughout the day on Monday. Finally, it impacts extreme northwest Montana Monday night into Tuesday. The precipitation amounts associated with this will be quite impressive. Areas of biggest concern being around Riggins/Grangeville area stretching eastward over the Clearwater/Bitterroot mountain ranges, through west central Montana on into the Bob Marshall Wilderness. Populated areas under this region could experience 1 to 2 inches of rainfall with the higher terrain having amounts in excess of 3 inches. The remainder of the Northern Rockies will experience precipitation, but totals should be less than inch of rain. Numerous areal flood watches have been issued for the potential of small stream and urban flooding. Some mainstem rivers will also have to be monitored as they might reach flood stage Tuesday morning, particularly the Clark Fork river. Snow levels will be dropping Sunday night into Monday morning, which might bring accumulating snow down to Lost Trail Pass. Temperatures on Monday will be around 20 degrees below average for this of year.\n\nCool and showery conditions will persist through Wednesday, then the upper level flow will become southwesterly for the end of the week. The flow pattern for the latter part of the week will allow temperatures to warm back to seasonal norms, but they will also be conducive for afternoon/evening thunderstorm activity.\n\nAnother low pressure system could impact the Northern Rockies for the fourth of July weekend bringing cooler temperatures and widespread shower activity.\n\n[...]\n\nMT...Flood Watch from Monday afternoon through late Tuesday night Bitterroot/Sapphire Mountains...Butte/Blackfoot Region... Flathead/Mission Valleys...Lower Clark Fork Region... Missoula/Bitterroot Valleys...Potomac/Seeley Lake Region... West Glacier Region.\n\n\n\nHourly forecast for Missoula\n\n\n\nHourly forecast for Alberton",

                "text": "The more people\u00a0 are aware of this the more likely we can live in Heaven Realms right here on earth. The more people who are ignorant of this fact the more Hell like life will be on earth. How can one explain this? I think of thinking of it like being an architect designing and building a centrally heated building to live in as opposed to living outside during a snow storm or inside of a cave freezing sitting next to a fire while breathing the smoke as the snow blows into the cave. People can create what they want here on earth. They don't have to suffer all the time. This is true intellectually, physically, emotionally and spiritually and in all ways. People are forced to stay in their homes worldwide a lot now if they don't want to die or have all or most of their relatives die worldwide. So, this time gives them lots of time to pray. Prayerful times in people's lives gives them time to talk to God and to angels and get much clearer with everything inside themselves and everything on earth and throughout the universe and all time and space. From these new perspectives and realizations we can all create a Heaven on earth if we choose to and want to. By God's Grace Note: The way I like to think about all this is that God is obviously thinning the human race out so we don't all go extinct from overpopulation here on earth. I think understanding that this is what is really happening will make everyone be able to deal with this a little better. I believe God is going to thin us out down to around 1 billion or less people by 2100 through pandemics and Global Warming. This is what is obvious to me. You might have a different point of view but this is mine.",

                "text": "Snow covered the state, particularly southwest Kansas, Wednesday nights and Thursday mornings, resulting in many local road and shop closures and power outages within the Garden City boundaries. \nAfter Governor Jeff Colyer declared a state of disaster for the state on Wednesday, he urged motorists to be aware of the unsafe driving conditions. \n\u201cWe want people to think twice about when to drive. Do it in daylight. Make sure you obey the traffic rules,\u201d Colyer told the Topeka Capital Journal. \nMidday reports showed Scott City caught most of the snowfall at 9 inches and saw both Lakin and Lane Counties 7 inches, said Larry Ruthi, a meteorologist at the National Weather Center in Dodge City.  Finney County was hit by about 6 inches, Deerfield by 4.5 and Syracuse by 4.2, Ruthi said.  Grant County and Gray counties saw splashes of 2 to 3 inches, he said. \nDrifts reached heights of two to three feet, said Gilbert Valerio, director of Finney County Emergency Management. \nThe storm, which included winds of up to 100 km / h across the region, was the largest single-day snowfall Garden City has seen since March 2009, Ruthi said, as the 2017 blizzard lasted mostly two days in the region. \nThe storm resulted in local closures on I-70 in western Kansas, US Highway 50 west from Garden City to the state line, Kansas Highway 25 north from Lakin, Kansas Highway 27, and US Highway 160, both from Morton County, said Kansas Highway Patrol Capt.  Randall Mosher.  At the end of the day, most of the roads were open again, although many were heavily covered in snow, according to Kandrive.org. \nThe KHP saw dozens of slips and a few minor accidents in the area, Mosher said, but nothing serious.  State teams assisted local officials in responding to motorists stranded or struggling, Valerio said. \nThere were also resources for those who opposed the street within the city limits.  According to a press release, the American Red Cross, Finney County\u2019s Emergency Management and Thomas County Emergency Management have teamed up to open temporary thermal centers in Garden City, Holcomb and Colby.  The centers provided shelter, food, water, information, and other resources for those who were away from home. \nGarden City, which is closer to where he lives, has seen isolated power outages in all parts of the city, said Cliff Sonnenberg, superintendent of Garden City\u2019s electrical division.  He said the department answered calls from around 2 a.m. to 3 p.m. and eventually brought all of the apartments back online, but saw a decline after the wind speeds fell. \nGarden City and Finney County\u2019s offices were both closed for the day, although representatives from both are expected to open on Friday.  The Sienna Medical Clinic, Convenient Care Clinic, Plaza Medical Center, Women\u2019s Clinic, and Heart Center & Wound Care in Garden City, as well as the Ulysses family doctors in Ulysses are all closed for the day, said Shawna Deal, community relations coordinator at the company St. Catherine Hospital in an email. \nHarvesting and processing operations at Tyson Fresh Meats in Holcomb were also suspended for the day due to dangerous road conditions. \nGarden City Regional Airport canceled its flights Wednesday evening, Thursday morning, afternoon and evening, and Friday morning, said Rachelle Powell, director of aviation.  After an early white-out and conditions of no visibility, airport staff attempted to plow the runway but were faced with a solid layer of ice from inches to an inch and a half that they were unable to remove with equipment or chemicals, Powell said Thursday afternoon . \nStaff were trying to reopen the runway to flights as soon as possible and passengers should check the airport\u2019s Facebook page for updates, Powell said.  She said the airport has not had a frozen runway problem in years. \n \nContact Amber Friend at afriend@gctelegram.com. \nThe post Frozen Stable: Piles of snow excessive in southwest Kansas;  Backyard Metropolis Has Largest One-Day Snowfall Since 2009 \u2013 Information \u2013 The Backyard Metropolis Telegram appeared first on THE KANSAS CITY PRESS. \n http://thekansascitypress.com/frozen-stable-piles-of-snow-excessive-in-southwest-kansas-backyard-metropolis-has-largest-one-day-snowfall-since-2009-information-the-backyard-metropolis-telegram/",

                "title": "Bison - The corporate beast",
                "text": "While I went deep into the ocean with the Octopus in my previous post, this time I dwelled in the vast prairies along with the corporate beast \u2013 \u201cBISON\u201d  A bison is a familiar animal for the people of North America and Europe. Many Asians might have heard about this animal during their school days while learning the alphabets as \"B for Bison\" or while watching some program in some science channels. Even my acquaintance with bison is minimal till the recent past. But now, I have huge respect for that beast and there is a reason for that.  Recently, I came across an interesting article about this wonderful beast on Twitter posted by some science journal. I got curious looking at the picture associated with the article.  That article was about how a bison survives the extreme cold conditions without hibernating. While reading that article, an interesting analogy with our corporate world struck my mind.   Before presenting the analogy, let me give you some general information about this animal and gradually we will move into the analogy.  Bison is a native animal of North America and Europe. They are herbivores and survive only on grass, herbs, shrubs and twigs. They are also called buffaloes due to their resemblance with buffaloes. However, bison is different from buffalo. The thick brown fur and the large, strong hump differentiates a bison from a buffalo.  As a native of North America and Europe bison has to survive the hostile winters. The winters in North America can be so harsh with -40 degrees temperature, 50 mph winds and ~35 inches of snow. As we all expect, surviving in such hostile conditions definitely need some extra adaptive response from the animal. Some animals go into hibernation and some will migrate to tropical lands. But Bison stays in the hostile weather.   But, how a Bison surviving the harsh winters of North America can be of any relevance to our business world?  As I look at it, a bison surviving the low temperatures, ~30-35 inches of snow, and 50 mph winds seems to be very similar to the corporates surviving a pandemic, lockdown or a prolonged interruption to the businesses.  A bison develops digestive, physiological and behavioural strategies to survive the winters. Corporates which develop a digestive (efficient consumption of funds), physiological (agile process and organizational structure) and behavioural strategies tend to survive if faced with hostile social or business conditions.  Bison develops thick, woolly coats and fat reserves below the coats and prepares itself for the harsh winter conditions and this is the same thing corporates do when they anticipate a long interruption or if they are into seasonal business. Corporates build cash reserves (fat reserves) when the business is flourishing and utilize them when the conditions are not fair. Cash reserves are similar to fat reserves. Excess of fat or excess of cash is not healthy for the business during normal conditions. But having cash reserves during the lockouts, pandemic or strikes help the companies to meet the immediate external obligations and help the organizations to survive the hostile external environment.  As the name suggests, the seasonal business will have certain months of low sales volume. This is very much similar to the non-availability of grass to bison during the winters. To avoid the impact of low forage, bison slows down its digestive system by minimizing its activity and thus minimizing the nutritional needs during the winters. This is the same way seasonal businesses work. They slow down the production (a nutritional requirement for organization) and thus reduces the consumption of funds.  One more interesting aspect that had drawn my attention is the way a bison adjusts its response to the harsh winds exceeding 40 mph. When a bison starts experiencing a storm, it turns against the direction of the storm, hunkers down and waits for the storm to pass. This is the same attitude to be anticipated from a firm when faced with an upwind. Turn against the events, top management (head) should lead from the front and hold the position firmly until the storm passes.  Before concluding, I want to make a note of a lesson that organizations can learn from bison. The gestation period of bison is approx. 285 days and so it extends well into the winter season also. Generally, the gestation period starts in mid-June and extends till mid-April the next year. Meanwhile, bison has to face the harsh winters while safeguarding the embryo inside its womb. This makes the life of a female bison more complicated. To support the fetus during winter, pregnant bison mobilizes the fat reserves to meet the nutritional demand. In this process, pregnant bison loses a lot of weight by the end of the winter season.  Here, both organizations and individuals can learn a lesson. While starting a project, we should anticipate the harsh conditions (risks) and should prepare ourselves to handle the situation just like the pregnant bison. Similar to the bison, we may lose a lot of our resources by the time we move out of the risks, but ultimately it pays off when we deliver the project successfully.   Thus, I am leaving this corporate beast back in its habitat to prosper and will meet you again with another animal, plant or any other natural process.  \u00a0 Fun Fact: Bison weighs 15-25 kg at birth and grows up to 1200 kgs by the time they mature completely.",

It was most excellent.  \n\n\n\nOther than that, I went to our beach once to witness a fiery sunset, and once to the nearby Lake Burano to observe floating sleeping ducks. One morning there was almost snow, the view from our roof was splendid as usual, we had neighbourhood bees, cats and dogs, and that\u2019s about it as Januaries go. See for yourselves that I\u2019m not lying.  \n\n\n\nIt started out subdued. A look to the west.To the south a minute later. Montalto di Castro power plant. Half an hour later it was a different story.At the same time fires were raging in Australia.Three minutes later. Bestia is happy.Ten days later we had something like snow. More like frozen humidity that didn\u2019t last long.The look west from our roof.Lake Burano. The pier was damaged in a storm a month ago. Sleeping floating ducks.Basilica of Santa Maria della Quercia, the Church of the Oak, in Viterbo.The cloister of the Basilica. Villa Lante in nearby Bagnaia. I saw a similar photo online and put it on my list. And now I had Flavia.Everything flows.Moss and a grin.Vicinity brings happiness. Probably the best door in Vitorchiano.

Over this time, students, staff, and some alumni have been asked a series of questions that looked at their connection to LSS and the term \u201cSaints,\u201d as well as to the visuals used to represent \u201cSaints.\u201d\nWhat students and staff said was that they were proud to be connected to Langley Secondary, and that they believed that the school represented well the characteristics of Inclusivity, Community, Diversity, and Strength.\nAt the same time, students and staff have also been clear about their connections to the term \u201cSaints;\u201d 79% of students did not feel any connection to the term \u201cSaints\u201d, while 82% did not feel any connection to visuals associated with \u201cSaints.\u201d\nTo reiterate, people felt good about being a part of LSS, but were unsure and unclear as to what \u201cSaints\u201d meant and how it connected to the school.\nThis lack of connection also is due to the fact that the\u00a0LSS population has changed a great deal since the term \u201cSaints\u201d first came to LSS in either the late 1950s or early 1960s. \u00a0This why the school has undergone this Visioning process: to honour and celebrate the past, while also looking forward to the future and a possible evolution from \u201cSaints\u201d to something that may better represent who we are now and who we will be in the future. To be clear, \u201cSaints\u201d is a positive term to a great many people in that it is aspirational and points to trying to be the best people we can be; at the same time, our reality is that our population no longer connects to this term.\nBelow, part of the Visioning Team presents to ya:yestel\u2019, the advisory group consisting of representatives from the four First Nations on whose land the Langley School District resides, as well as representatives from the Langley School District. The purpose of the presentation was to seek guidance from ya:yestel\u2019 while LSS continues to move towards this evolution of identity. More details to come as we continue to move forward on this journey\u2026\n\n\nMrs. Florko, along with Mr. Tesan, Ms. Turpin, and Mr. Kardos, as they prepare for the presentation. \n\nMr. Howlett and Ms. Turpin, while the TV screen shows one slide of the PowerPoint in the presentation. \nMr. Kardos printing his part, while Mr. Tesan watches the TV screen on the far side of the room. \n\n\n\nACTIVE & VISIBLE LEARNING AT LSS THIS WEEK! \n\nMs. Lee\u2019s Japanese 11 students played Guess Who? this week.

The purpose of the lesson is to teach students different skills that delay the response after an emotional event. By learning to delay our response, we allow the \u201cthinking and rational\u201d part of our brains to intercede and help us have healthier and more appropriate responses.\n\nCAREERS CORNER \n\nTHIS WEEK!

So, where do you go to get information about the status of schools during periods of\u00a0inclement\u00a0weather? If you are able to access the internet via computer or smartphone, current information about Langley schools can be accessed on all school websites or\u00a0www.sd35.bc.ca.\u00a0Updates are also posted to Twitter @LangleySchools and Facebook at\u00a0www.facebook.com/langleyschooldistrict.\u00a0If you don\u2019t have internet connectivity but your phone is working, call a relative or friend in an area that has not been affected by the storm and ask them to check the district website for you. Local radio stations are also informed of school status in Langley.\u00a0Tune in to CKWX 1130AM, CKNW 980AM, Country Radio 107.1FM, Pulse 107.7 or CBC 690AM or 88.1FM for updates.\nPlease note that Langley District schools are all considered \u2018open\u2019 until a decision to close is required. Decisions on school closures are usually made by 6:30am. As always, it is a parent\u2019s decision whether to send their child to school based on safety and individual circumstances. If you feel it is unsafe for you or your child to travel to or attend an open school for any reason, please keep your child home and report an absence to the school.\n\n\nCommunity Bulletin Board \u2013 SD#35 Langley:\u00a0To find out more about the different community events happening in our District, consider making it a habit to go to the District\u2019s website, and you will certainly be in the know!\u00a0https://www.sd35.bc.ca/news-events/community-bulletin-board/\n\nCALENDAR \n\nJan 20 \u2013 Piping & Plumbing Online Orientation, 6:30 pm\nJan 25 \u2013 PAC Meeting, 7 pm, Library Learning Commons\nJan 25-29 \u2013 Literacy and Numeracy Assessment Week\nFeb 1 \u2013 Last Day of Quarter 2\nFeb 2 \u2013 Quarter Turnaround Day (Students NOT in Session)\nFeb 3 \u2013 First Day of Quarter 3\nFeb 8 \u2013 KPU Presentation\nFeb 8 \u2013 Focus Mood Walk\nFeb 9 \u2013 Quarter 2 Report Cards Published\nFeb 12 \u2013 Professional Development Day, Students NOT in Session\nFeb 15 \u2013 Family Day, Schools are CLOSED\nFeb 22 \u2013 PAC Meeting, 7 pm, Library Learning Commons\nFeb 22-27 \u2013 Grad Portrait Week\nApr 19 \u2013 PAC Meeting, 7 pm, Library Learning Commons\nMay 17 \u2013 PAC Meeting and AGM, 7 pm, Library Learning Commons\nJune 16 \u2013 LSS Grad Ceremony, Tentatively Booked at CLA, 7 pm\nJune 29 \u2013 Final Report Cards Issued",

                "text": "Anyone who\u2019s familiar with the winter wonderland known as Downriver Michigan would recommend that Downriver MI Entry Doors should be partnered with a storm door. For those planning to move in from warmer climates, Michigan enjoys mostly fair weather, often overcast with clouds, with occasional rains and cold, biting winters. The rains and occasional rains can do a number on old wooden doors or even new ones. So it\u2019s recommended for new and current residents to have storm doors installed.   What exactly are storm doors for those who aren\u2019t familiar? Storm doors are companion doors which are placed over the main entry door which is mostly glass with a sturdy frame, unlike screen doors made with metallic or plastic netting. Storm doors can protect the primary entry door from rain, ice and snow and helps for the door to last longer. The only problem with storm doors is that the glass can trap heat and damage the primary door when used in hot climates. Therefore, storm doors are perfect for Downriver MI Entry Doors because of Michigan\u2019s temperate climate. https://www.furniture-poland.com/furniture/why-storm-doors-are-recommended-for-downriver-mi-entry-doors/ https://doorsmichigan.com/",

I found out today, the heavy snow had blanketed most of the feeders.  The cold, wet, thaw, freeze of the last 48 hours, also brought down weak limbs.  To this end I found several of the  feeders on the ground, one very damaged, and the other not so bad, but in need of attention. \n\n\n\nI sent myself to clearing off the snow, and putting out fresh seed so that the now hovering birds could eat, while I righted the refilled the feeders that had suffered during the storm. \n\n\n\nthis heavy feeder was the one that had been on the limb that came down during the storm.  I was fortunate that I was able to get a snowshoe enthusiast who came by with his young son to help me get it back up on a sturdier limb.  The man had to put his son on his shoulders, so that we could hang the first   S hook.  Fortunately I had gone to the store a few days ago and stocked up on the larger S hooks.  I had no idea at the time why I had a need to acquire them.. The Universe knew\u2026 they sure came in handy today.\n\n\n\nI use a variety of containers, so that i can offer an assortment of food.  The stump on the left had to be cleared of snow so that the black sunflower seeds and peanuts could be scattered there for the birds to drop down and gather up.\n\n\n\nAt the Mer Bleue site, I was thrilled to see a bird that till that moment I had not seen, a Hoary red poll.  When I get a picture I will share it with you. \n\n\n\nNow that the birds have been fed.  It is my turn, home made beef bone soup with fresh veggies and dried Chinese mushrooms.

                "text": "A couple friends sent me a link to a writing contest that turned out to be a scam AND I was really struggling with a post for today. So, instead of writing talk, here\u2019s some actual writing. Enjoy. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nStars pinprick the velvet night, along the beach. A barn owl hoots softly near by. I wish you could tell you. I know how much you loved them. I hear the waves, but I won\u2019t go into the water. You always said night is when the sharks come in to feed. Instead, I breathe the brine and darkness and a faint taste in my mouth I never understood, but know it belongs to the ocean. The granular sand sticks to me. I run it through my fingers, and think about you. I think about being fourteen, and collecting shells along the shore. I think about being eighteen, and you insisting you must get out of the car. It didn\u2019t matter how sick you were, by god, you had to see the sunset break across the blue. I remember being twenty-eight, and you telling me you needed to see the ocean one more time, before you died. You never did.\u00a0 \n\n\n\nBut that\u2019s okay. Here in the darkness, no one has to know that. Here, I can pretend you\u2019re with me as we watch the moon crest the horizon. As full as windfilled sails, she moves across the water like a ghost.\u00a0 I take clumps of rough sand and mix them with water from a discarded cup. I pile it high, until I can shape and mold it under my fingers. We were supposed to make a sandcastle, next time we came.\u00a0 \n\n\n\nWe were supposed to do a lot of things. But I won\u2019t think about that now. Right now, I think about the shape. I\u2019m not a sculptor who builds with my hands, but I remember the roundness of your face. Your bright smile. I remember your eyes, a color I\u2019ve never seen before. Before the sunset, I picked through the rainbow hued sea-glass, until I found them. A pale greenish blue, like tears from the ocean. I place them tenderly on the misshapen sandy head, and make a mouth of tiny shells. It\u2019s finished. \n\n\n\nBeside my creation, I breathe. I swear\u2026 I can almost smell you. Not the smell after the sickness, tainted with creams and pills and injections and gauze. And not the smell of the hospital, so clean and sterile. No, this is the smell of you before. Light coconut and sweet pear perfume. If I can smell you, then it worked. For just a second, words tremble in my throat, before they tumble out, as water tumbles from the river into the sea. \n\n\n\n\u201cSee, Mama?\u201d I wipe the salted grief from leaking eyes. \u201cI promised I\u2019d take you to the beach. And you taught me to never break a promise. See?\u201d I plead. \u201cI did good. Didn\u2019t I? Please tell me I did good.\u201d\u00a0 \n\n\n\nI open my eyes. The tiny tower of sand and shells is gone. Instead, I see you. You smile at me, like you always used to.\u00a0 \n\n\n\n\u201cI knew my baby boy wouldn\u2019t let me down.\u201d You laugh like a gull on the wing and push my hair out of my eyes.\u00a0 \n\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m proud of you, baby. And I always have been.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0 \n\n\n\nFor six months, it\u2019s all I wanted to hear. All I dreamed of. I open my mouth to speak, but you shush me with your finger.\u00a0 \n\n\n\n\u201cI love you,\u201d you say. \u201c But it\u2019s time to go now. The tide is coming.\u201d\u00a0 \n\n\n\n\u201cNo!\u201d The words escape me in an inhuman cry. It\u2019s deranged and pleading and scrapes across the quiet night like waves lashing against a storm. \u201dJust five more minutes?\u201d \n\n\n\nYou shake your head. \u201cIf it didn\u2019t work at bed time, it won\u2019t work now.\u201d You whisper, and kiss my wet cheek.\u00a0 \n\n\n\nI want to beg, but it\u2019s too late. My little sand sculpture greets my eyes. It\u2019s not you. Maybe it never was. But it doesn\u2019t matter now. Time is against me. Salt and sea foam, like snow under the moon, laps at my ankles. You begin to crumble. I try and hold you, but my hands are sieves and you flow out, and away. Just like last time.\u00a0 \n\n\n\n\u201cSail on, silver girl,\u201d I whisper to no one. \u201cSail on.\u201d \n\n\n\nI sit for a moment in the wet grit. The wind whips against me, and I am alone.\u00a0 \n\n\n\nAfter a time, I take the sandy trail back away from the water and the moon and the air so filled with salt it takes my breath.\u00a0 \n\n\n\nA barn owl hoots in the distance.\u00a0 \n\n\n\n__________________________________________  \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n  -Your Loving Vincent",

Her name was Athena. She was quite beautiful in her stillness, each feather blending perfectly into the ashen colors of faded bark and wood.\u00a0 \n\n\n\nA kind fox guarded the tree faithfully keeping watch through wind, water, sleet and snow. Zenlike in his silence and calm.\u00a0At some point betwixt space and time an unfamiliar creature came sauntering down the snowy path, it appeared to be a human child.\u00a0 \n\n\n\n\u201cHello,\u201d called the wide-eyed child to the fox. \u201cAren\u2019t you cold?\u201d \n\n\n\nThe snow covered fox shook his head and remained silent. Noting the layers of fluff and wool wrapping the small boy.\u00a0The little boy gingerly removed his blue knit scarf and placed it around the fox\u2019s neck. The fox was both surprised and warmed by the gesture. \n\n\n\n\u201cMy name is Jamie. What shall I call you?\u201d\u00a0 \n\n\n\nThe fox shook his head to loosen the scarf a little and rid himself of fallen snow. Jamie looked up to the tree and stared. \u201cIs that an Owl?\u201d \n\n\n\n\u201cHello Owl!\u201d called Jamie moving closer to the tree. Snowflakes settled on his long dark eyelashes as he continued to stare.\u00a0 \n\n\n\nThe owl blinked down at the child.\u00a0 \n\n\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know what I would find when I went looking for a reason.\u201d\u00a0 \n\n\n\nThe owl and the fox were now curious, what sort of reason was the child looking for?\u00a0 \n\n\n\n\u201cOwl,\u201d called the boy. \u201cI think you are the reason. Will you let me inside your tree?\u201d \n\n\n\nJust how did the boy know there was an inside to the tree, the Owl and the fox were quite surprised. \n\n\n\nThe boy knocked on the wood beneath the beautiful Owl. An echo resounded with continuous tones like music. \n\n\n\n\u201cKnock knock,\u201d smiled the boy, \u201cWho\u2019s there?\u201d\u00a0 \n\n\n\nSuddenly an array of lavender butterflies came floating up from one of the knots in the tree, they danced close to the boy\u2019s face and\u00a0 \n\n\n\nbegan to circle him in figure eights. This is when the boy knew he had surpassed reason and moved into the realm of hope. \n\n\n\n\u201cAww, you will let me in won\u2019t you?\u201d Jamie pleaded calmly. \u201cI know this is where I\u2019m meant to be. Where I\u2019ve come from.\u201d \n\n\n\nSuddenly the fox and the owl understood. This was no ordinary child. They glanced at one another and decided, yes they would let him enter the tree, they would allow him to return to his rightful place. \n\n\n\nThe Owl slowly moved her wings from their frozen place and fluttered them fiercely, the snow that was falling became a swirling storm and the butterlies took hold of the branches, bracing themselves. The fox shut his eyes and remained very still. Within a moment a door was revealed, and then with a creak it slightly opened. \n\n\n\n\u201cOh Thank you Majesty Owl.\u201d The boy was delighted, he turned to the fox and bowed with gratitude. \u201cThank you kind fox.\u201d \n\n\n\n\u00a0The Fox nodded and watched the boy disappear into the tree, he could hear feint echoes of greeting and then the door disappeared as the Owl resumed her place in the tree. \n\n\n\nSoon all was quiet, the snow stopped falling, the crocus \u00a0began to wake, and the fox was bathed in the first light of a new Spring. \n\n\n\n(Perhaps to be continued at another time) \n\n\n\n~Written by Christine Wichman c.2014 \n\n\n\nMusical pairing: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEWMYfcg1o8&fbclid=IwAR0e-I-h66aRRmnthFAC4lhcRiq6pNin0nknJP8\u2013v39Q_2huhikpp6LjZo",

What Are Its Impacts? - Spectrum News       Posted: 14 Jan 2021 12:45 PM PST   Winter sure throws a lot of weather hazards in our direction including snowy and icy travel conditions. Luckily, we have road departments at the ready to salt and clear the path so we can avoid slipping and sliding off the road.         What You Need To Know  Road salt has been used since the 1930s   There are unique alternatives to road salt   Road salt runoff creates hazards to natural resources and wildlife        With millions of tons of road salt spread across America's pavement every year, one has to wonder where it all goes once it gets washed away and what kind of impact this has on our ecosystem.   While there are a plethora of products used to melt snow and ice from roadways, today I'll focus on road salt.     What Is It?     Road salt or rock salt is basically sodium chloride in its natural form, right from the salt mines. Halite is the naturally mined mineral form of rock salt. Most batches contain additives to prevent it from caking while in transport or dispersion. Rock salt and road salt brine are widely used to melt snow because they are both inexpensive and effective.       How Does It Work?     Road salt does its job by melting snow through a process called freezing point depression. This means the addition of salt lowers the freezing point\u00a0of water. Road salt is applied dry, then quickly dissolves into brine in order for the effects to take place. Basically, when salt is dropped, the snow melts and turns to liquid.     Why So Much Salt?     Road crews repeatedly spread snow melt before, during, and sometimes after the storm. The aim of the treatment is to alleviate the bond on the surface of the roadway between the pavement and the snow.   As temperatures drop, melting power weakens, which is why extended winter storms typically require multiple applications. Another reason for this is salt concentration dilutes over time, making it less effective.     Are There Lasting Impacts From Road Salt Use?     Well, here's where I was curious. When snow melts or a rain storm hits, where does all the salt go? What does it do to our waterways and wildlife?   Here's some insight. Snowmelt creates runoff that travels through drains, which in turn ends up in our surface water. Watersheds near paved roads tend to show a higher concentration of salinity in nearby bodies of water. As we drive the roads, salt water gets sprayed onto trees, shrubs, and soil, causing disruption to water uptake in roadside plants. This throws off the balance of nutrients in the plants.   Andrew A. Nelles/AP       Salt sprayed onto trees and shrubs creates a burnt, brown look that isn't discovered until spring. Salt pollution also creates a lack of available oxygen for freshwater aquatic life which leads to interruptions in growth, reproduction and food sources. Too much salt in freshwater lakes and rivers alters the oxygen level needed for healthy systems.   This Smithsonian Magazine article touches on research by Rick Relyea, from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute about the trickle-down effects that road salt has on a number of species in our ecosystem.   Too much salt in our drinking water infrastructure causes corrosion of pipes, leading to additional water contamination. Highly salted water not only tastes bad \u2013 it's unhealthy to drink, especially for those with health issues like diabetes or anyone on a doctor-advised low-salt diet.   Apart from the ecological issues caused by road salt runoff, a high amount of roadway erosion and structural building damage can also occur. According to the Columbia University Earth Institute, salt use causes an estimated $5 billion in corrosion damage every year in the U.S.     If Not Salt, Then What?     There are unique and safer alternatives to road salt that are being used in some states.   Anything from cheese brine to molasses and even volcanic rock and solar power have been used as alternatives to melt snow and ice. Don't believe me? Read up on it here. Even beet juice can treat snowy roads!   With more winter season still ahead of us, there's likely plenty of road salt in our future. It's a good time to observe how we use this resource and to think about ways to improve its safety for all of the living things around us.\u00a0               You are subscribed to email updates from \"lowsaltdiet\" - Google News.

                "text": "The first couple of weeks of this year I have barely picked up my camera. I have been busy reorganizing my house as I now have my own office, which I am happy about but it has been a lot of work. We also had a rare (once in a decade) snow storm with a couple of inches of snow, but I don\u2019t feel like any of my picture were very remarkable. \nSnow in the Park \u2013 Leander Texas\nI have been hiking out at the Balcones Canyonlands National Wildlife Refuge, but half the place has been recently burned so the grasses are replaced with ash and stones. The image below shows the now clearly exposed hiking trails through the burned landscape. This was shot nearly into the morning sun so please forgive the big green glob of lens flare near the horizon. \n \nThe snow means that there is some water in the creek and I thought that the stepping stones with the trail leading off to the left made a nice picture. This part of the refuge has not been burned. \nCreek Crossing at Balcones Canyonlands National Wildlife Refuge\nThe photo below has the other creek crossing. I worked trying to get the fluffy reeds in the lower right to standout in the morning sunlight with the stepping stone creek crossing on the far left. I was again fighting with lens flare for this photo as the morning sun was all alone in the clear blue sky. That tall structure on the other side of the creek is a bat house. \nCreek Crossing at Balcones Canyonlands National Wildlife Refuge\nAnd lastly, in a part of the refuge which has not been burned, the tall grasses still sway in the wind and catch the sunlight in the early morning and late afternoon. This was a very still morning so I was not able to catch motion blur in the grass, but I do like the pattern and color of the grass. All I need is a subject in the far-ground. If you look closely in the distance on the right side of the photo you can see the same bat house from above. \nLong Grass at Balcones Canyonlands National Wildlife Refuge\nNot the most fantastic landscape pictures, but it is always good to get out with the camera. I can\u2019t wait for the wildflowers to emerge in a couple of months. Thanks for reading.",

                "text": "It\u2019s Tanuary! I\u2019ve decided to pace myself this year, since last year showed that a solid month of Tanith Lee is\u2026 a lot, even for a fan like me. \n\n\n\nSpace is Just a Starry Night\n\n\n\nThis is a collection united by the theme of stars. That\u2019s actually a pretty vague theme, when you think about it. Most of these stories are science fiction, or science fantasy, or fantasy-that-takes-place-in-the-future. The table of contents breaks up the stories into subsections with titles like \u201cMyth Remembered\u201d and \u201cDeath\u2019s Door.\u201d This collection has some solid stories in it but overall left me cold, and I don\u2019t see myself revisiting it any time soon. \n\n\n\nThe section titled \u201cBurning Bright\u201d had my favorite stories of the collection. \u201cFelixity,\u201d drew me in immediately with the tragic fairy-tale romance that I love in Lee\u2019s work, plus a fiery ending. \u201cYou are My Sunshine\u201d also ends with fire, while \u201cThe Thaw\u201d was a neat turn on stories about people being awakened from cryogenic slumber. \u201cStalking the Leopard,\u201d is also great, though I think I may have liked the fairy tale she includes at the end more than the story proper. \n\n\n\nThere\u2019s a section called \u201cFallen Angels\u201d in which we find three stories with a Biblical slant. The Devil as an alien invader, a sci-fi version of Genesis 2, that sort of thing. This kind of story seems to be a favorite of Lee\u2019s, but she\u2019s done it better elsewhere. Go read \u201cThe Origin of Snow,\u201d to see what I\u2019m talking about. \n\n\n\nI would like to mention that two of these stories (\u201cThe Thaw\u201d and \u201cWritten in Water\u201d) mention a pandemic that has severely reduced the human population of Earth. Plague seems like an easy reach for a science-fiction story, so I\u2019m not claiming the author was particularly prescient, but it does add an extra level of unease to be reading such things in the middle of an actual pandemic. \n\n\n\nOn that note\u2026 the world was crazy last year and this young year is so far even crazier. I don\u2019t know about you, but my concentration continues to suffer, and Tanith Lee\u2019s writing requires a lot of concentration. So for the rest of the month, I think I\u2019m gonna re-read something for comfort. Either The Silver Metal Lover or The Book of the Beast. Check back by the 31st to see how I decide! \n\n\n\nTwo shout-outs before I go. First, as with last year, to the invaluable resource that is Daughter of the Night: An Annotated Tanith Lee Bibliography. I wonder if the curator knows about my blog. Hrm. \n\n\n\nSecond, I learned a few days ago that Storm Constantine, author and the ultimate Tanith Lee fan, has died. It\u2019s thanks to her that we have some of Lee\u2019s stories. I have never read Constantine\u2019s work, something I plan to remedy next month. I\u2019m looking forward to it.",

                "text": "Wet snow falls Saturday evening in St. Albans, Vermont, clinging to every branch and tree.The almost-ended snowstorm in Vermont we had this weekend is going to be remembered a real back breaker.\u00a0 \u00a0  This was one of the most sopping wet, slushy snowstorms we've had in recent years.\u00a0 The water content of the snow was super high. In places that got a lot of snow, that means it's going to be hard to clean up.\u00a0 Definitely get some young buff person to shovel your driveway if you have any concerns about your heart, or if you are just out of shape.\u00a0 A for example of the wetness of this snow: Rochester, Vermont got 16.5 inches of snow, and it had a water content of 1.38 inches.\u00a0 The big winners at latest report for snow in Vermont were 19 inches in Warren; 18.5 inches in East Dover and Stratton; 17 inches in Readsboro and 15 inches in Moretown and Mount Holly.\u00a0 Lower elevations had rain mixed in, lowering the snow totals.\u00a0 My place in St. Albans, Vermont had 4.2 inches, most of which came last evening and overnight.\u00a0 Burlington managed 3.2 inches of snow on Saturday with the temperature never once falling below freezing all day - the low temperature Saturday was 33 degrees. The heavy, wet snow not surprisingly caused trouble with trees and power lines. That 4.2 inches here in St. Albans was so wet and heavy that it broke a few small branches. That small amount of snow under normal circumstances would never have been nearly enough to cause that.\u00a0 You can imagine what more than a foot of slush can do.\u00a0 \u00a0There were still more than 3,000 homes and businesses without power in Vermont as of late morning Sunday.\u00a0 There was a report from Warren this morning that a section of Route 100 was closed because several transformers and wires were arcing, setting fire to some trees. It's still warm out for one more day as the cold air behind the storm is very much lagging.\u00a0 So there will be more slush to deal with until it turns to ice tonight.\u00a0Just a little more than four inches of new snow is so wet it is greatly weighing down trees in\u00a0 St. Albans, Vermont today.\u00a0  There will still be those upslope snows going in the Green Mountains all day, so a few more inches might pile up there.\u00a0 The Northeast Kingdom got mostly cheated by this storm, as the lower elevations there got a fair amount of rain. A couple inches might accumulate there today.\u00a0 It's been a remarkably warm January so far, but today is the last of it.\u00a0 We're in for an extended period of much more normal temperatures for January.\u00a0 After today, high temperatures will stay below freezing for the foreseeable future, and nights will get into the single numbers and teens.\u00a0 We might finally get to the point later in the week, or more likely later in the month, in which temperatures actually get below zero. That's not guaranteed, but it's possible.\u00a0 I still see no sign of any of those epic cold waves Vermont sometimes gets, the kind where it gets into the 20s and 30s below zero.\u00a0 Unless there's a surprise, we won't see anything like that this month.\u00a0 Not weird for Vermont this time of year, but weird that we've gone so long without such chilly nights.\u00a0 There's also no sign of any other big storms for at least the next week.\u00a0 Instead, we'll deal with moisture starved little \"Alberta Clippers\" coming in from the west and northwest.\u00a0 Each one will toss a handful or two of snowflakes at us, but nothing wild. The strongest of these clippers should come by around Thursday, and that one could bring some very light accumulations to the valleys, and perhaps a few inches in the mountains.\u00a0 For sure, though, if you want to play around in the snow we just got, you have time to do it. It's not going anywhere anytime soon.",

                "text": "A rare positive of the pandemic era has been the dramatic reduction in California\u2019s infamous traffic congestion. \nThat\u2019s what recessions do. Fewer jobs, fewer commutes. Right? \nWell, 2020 was an economic oddity for many reasons. The stay-at-home mentality promoted to slowing the spread of coronavirus also impacted how many folks were on the road. And since remote working likely will endure past the pandemic\u2019s end, its ability to cut congestion \u2014 and perhaps investments in transportation infrastructure spending \u2014 looks intriguing. \nMy trusty spreadsheet tells me that last year\u2019s traffic improvements in the Bay Area outpaced Southern California. That\u2019s due more to the two region\u2019s varying job types, not job losses. \nTo calculate commuting rankings, I compared traffic and employment stats using data on traffic jams in 57 big U.S. cities from navigation gear maker TomTom, November unemployment data in those markets, and how they fared in a study of metro-area workforces and their potential to work remotely by Outdoorsy, a recreation vehicle rental app. \nPonder what I learned about San Jose vs. the Inland Empire, two job hubs near big cities. \nCuriously, both had congestion woes 19% of the time in 2020, ranking fifth-highest among the 57 markets tracked. But San Jose\u2019s 2020 traffic was 42% less congested vs. 2019 \u2014 the second-largest drop. Riverside congestion was down 27%, the 20th smallest decline. \nIt probably wasn\u2019t the scale of job losses that explains the difference between these two suburban areas. The San Jose area\u2019s unemployment was 5.1% \u2014 up 113% in a year. Riverside was at 7.9%, also up 113%. \nLeaving California? Here\u2019s a ranking of the best states \u00a0for relocation.\nSo, consider instead the hot industries in the two regions. San Jose is a tech hub and very friendly to remote work. Riverside is all about logistics, which is nearly impossible to do from home. In fact, warehousing and shipping help to power stay-at-home life. \nIn the San Jose market, it\u2019s estimated 48.5% of jobs can be done remotely \u2014 No. 1 among these 57 cities studied for congestion. Riverside? Just 29.6% of folks have work-for-home potential \u2014 tied for last with Grand Rapids, Mich., a historic factory town known as \u201cFurniture City.\u201d \nBigger trend\nA somewhat similar pattern was found in the nearby big cities. \nSan Francisco traffic was 21% congested in 2020 \u2014 with 42% fewer delays in a year, the No. 5 drop. Los Angeles was congested 27% of the time \u2014 still No. 1 nationally even after traffic improved 36%. That drop ranked No. 12 out of 57. \nThe improvement gap between these giant, urban employment hubs can\u2019t be unemployment. Yes, the jumps in rates exceeded their suburban neighbor\u2019s joblessness but they were remarkably similar. San Francisco\u2019s jobless rate was 6.1% \u2014 up 154% in a year while L.A.\u2019s rate rose 153% to 9.6%. \nNext, look at remote-work potential. \nIn tech-heavy San Francisco, 43% of jobs are work-from-home ready, the third-highest share of the 57.

                "text": "A rare positive of the pandemic era has been the dramatic reduction in California\u2019s infamous traffic congestion. \nThat\u2019s what recessions do. Fewer jobs, fewer commutes. Right? \nWell, 2020 was an economic oddity for many reasons. The stay-at-home mentality promoted to slowing the spread of coronavirus also impacted how many folks were on the road. And since remote working likely will endure past the pandemic\u2019s end, its ability to cut congestion \u2014 and perhaps investments in transportation infrastructure spending \u2014 looks intriguing. \nMy trusty spreadsheet tells me that last year\u2019s traffic improvements in the Bay Area outpaced Southern California. That\u2019s due more to the two region\u2019s varying job types, not job losses. \nTo calculate commuting rankings, I compared traffic and employment stats using data on traffic jams in 57 big U.S. cities from navigation gear maker TomTom, November unemployment data in those markets, and how they fared in a study of metro-area workforces and their potential to work remotely by Outdoorsy, a recreation vehicle rental app. \nPonder what I learned about San Jose vs. the Inland Empire, two job hubs near big cities. \nCuriously, both had congestion woes 19% of the time in 2020, ranking fifth-highest among the 57 markets tracked. But San Jose\u2019s 2020 traffic was 42% less congested vs. 2019 \u2014 the second-largest drop. Riverside congestion was down 27%, the 20th smallest decline. \nIt probably wasn\u2019t the scale of job losses that explains the difference between these two suburban areas. The San Jose area\u2019s unemployment was 5.1% \u2014 up 113% in a year. Riverside was at 7.9%, also up 113%. \nLeaving California? Here\u2019s a ranking of the best states \u00a0for relocation.\nSo, consider instead the hot industries in the two regions. San Jose is a tech hub and very friendly to remote work. Riverside is all about logistics, which is nearly impossible to do from home. In fact, warehousing and shipping help to power stay-at-home life. \nIn the San Jose market, it\u2019s estimated 48.5% of jobs can be done remotely \u2014 No. 1 among these 57 cities studied for congestion. Riverside? Just 29.6% of folks have work-for-home potential \u2014 tied for last with Grand Rapids, Mich., a historic factory town known as \u201cFurniture City.\u201d \nBigger trend\nA somewhat similar pattern was found in the nearby big cities. \nSan Francisco traffic was 21% congested in 2020 \u2014 with 42% fewer delays in a year, the No. 5 drop. Los Angeles was congested 27% of the time \u2014 still No. 1 nationally even after traffic improved 36%. That drop ranked No. 12 out of 57. \nThe improvement gap between these giant, urban employment hubs can\u2019t be unemployment. Yes, the jumps in rates exceeded their suburban neighbor\u2019s joblessness but they were remarkably similar. San Francisco\u2019s jobless rate was 6.1% \u2014 up 154% in a year while L.A.\u2019s rate rose 153% to 9.6%. \nNext, look at remote-work potential. \nIn tech-heavy San Francisco, 43% of jobs are work-from-home ready, the third-highest share of the 57. In Los Angeles \u2014 with an economy filled with in-person work such as hospitality, port and factory jobs \u2014 37% of workers can potentially work from home, ranking No. 23 of 57. \nNo local oddity\nThis gap is not just some north-south California quirk. \nLet\u2019s look at what my spreadsheet told me when I divided the 57 cities into three groupings, ranked by drops in 2020 congestion. \nJoblessness didn\u2019t matter. \nSign up for The Home Stretch email newsletter  filled with housing news from the region!

                "text": "A rare positive of the pandemic era has been the dramatic reduction in California\u2019s infamous traffic congestion. \nThat\u2019s what recessions do. Fewer jobs, fewer commutes. Right? \nWell, 2020 was an economic oddity for many reasons. The stay-at-home mentality promoted to slowing the spread of coronavirus also impacted how many folks were on the road. And since remote working likely will endure past the pandemic\u2019s end, its ability to cut congestion \u2014 and perhaps investments in transportation infrastructure spending \u2014 looks intriguing. \nMy trusty spreadsheet tells me that last year\u2019s traffic improvements in the Bay Area outpaced Southern California. That\u2019s due more to the two region\u2019s varying job types, not job losses. \nTo calculate commuting rankings, I compared traffic and employment stats using data on traffic jams in 57 big U.S. cities from navigation gear maker TomTom, November unemployment data in those markets, and how they fared in a study of metro-area workforces and their potential to work remotely by Outdoorsy, a recreation vehicle rental app. \nPonder what I learned about San Jose vs. the Inland Empire, two job hubs near big cities. \nCuriously, both had congestion woes 19% of the time in 2020, ranking fifth-highest among the 57 markets tracked. But San Jose\u2019s 2020 traffic was 42% less congested vs. 2019 \u2014 the second-largest drop. Riverside congestion was down 27%, the 20th smallest decline. \nIt probably wasn\u2019t the scale of job losses that explains the difference between these two suburban areas. The San Jose area\u2019s unemployment was 5.1% \u2014 up 113% in a year. Riverside was at 7.9%, also up 113%. \nLeaving California? Here\u2019s a ranking of the best states \u00a0for relocation.\nSo, consider instead the hot industries in the two regions. San Jose is a tech hub and very friendly to remote work. Riverside is all about logistics, which is nearly impossible to do from home. In fact, warehousing and shipping help to power stay-at-home life. \nIn the San Jose market, it\u2019s estimated 48.5% of jobs can be done remotely \u2014 No. 1 among these 57 cities studied for congestion. Riverside? Just 29.6% of folks have work-for-home potential \u2014 tied for last with Grand Rapids, Mich., a historic factory town known as \u201cFurniture City.\u201d \nBigger trend\nA somewhat similar pattern was found in the nearby big cities. \nSan Francisco traffic was 21% congested in 2020 \u2014 with 42% fewer delays in a year, the No. 5 drop. Los Angeles was congested 27% of the time \u2014 still No. 1 nationally even after traffic improved 36%. That drop ranked No. 12 out of 57. \nThe improvement gap between these giant, urban employment hubs can\u2019t be unemployment. Yes, the jumps in rates exceeded their suburban neighbor\u2019s joblessness but they were remarkably similar. San Francisco\u2019s jobless rate was 6.1% \u2014 up 154% in a year while L.A.\u2019s rate rose 153% to 9.6%. \nNext, look at remote-work potential. \nIn tech-heavy San Francisco, 43% of jobs are work-from-home ready, the third-highest share of the 57. In Los Angeles \u2014 with an economy filled with in-person work such as hospitality, port and factory jobs \u2014 37% of workers can potentially work from home, ranking No. 23 of 57. \nNo local oddity\nThis gap is not just some north-south California quirk. \nLet\u2019s look at what my spreadsheet told me when I divided the 57 cities into three groupings, ranked by drops in 2020 congestion. \nJoblessness didn\u2019t matter. \nSign up for The Home Stretch email newsletter  filled with housing news from the region!

Joblessness in 19 cities with the smallest congestion improvements \u2014 averaging 23% \u2014 rose 104% to 6.8%. \nHowever, work-from-home differed. \nThe big traffic declines came in markets averaging 39% of jobs with remote potential. The smallest congestion improvements were in towns in which 34% of jobs had work-from-home possibilities. \nHopefully, many questions raised during pandemic life will be studied once the health crisis is over.

                "text": "A rare positive of the pandemic era has been the dramatic reduction in California\u2019s infamous traffic congestion. \nThat\u2019s what recessions do. Fewer jobs, fewer commutes. Right? \nWell, 2020 was an economic oddity for many reasons. The stay-at-home mentality promoted to slowing the spread of coronavirus also impacted how many folks were on the road. And since remote working likely will endure past the pandemic\u2019s end, its ability to cut congestion \u2014 and perhaps investments in transportation infrastructure spending \u2014 looks intriguing. \nMy trusty spreadsheet tells me that last year\u2019s traffic improvements in the Bay Area outpaced Southern California. That\u2019s due more to the two region\u2019s varying job types, not job losses. \nTo calculate commuting rankings, I compared traffic and employment stats using data on traffic jams in 57 big U.S. cities from navigation gear maker TomTom, November unemployment data in those markets, and how they fared in a study of metro-area workforces and their potential to work remotely by Outdoorsy, a recreation vehicle rental app. \nPonder what I learned about San Jose vs. the Inland Empire, two job hubs near big cities. \nCuriously, both had congestion woes 19% of the time in 2020, ranking fifth-highest among the 57 markets tracked. But San Jose\u2019s 2020 traffic was 42% less congested vs. 2019 \u2014 the second-largest drop. Riverside congestion was down 27%, the 20th smallest decline. \nIt probably wasn\u2019t the scale of job losses that explains the difference between these two suburban areas. The San Jose area\u2019s unemployment was 5.1% \u2014 up 113% in a year. Riverside was at 7.9%, also up 113%. \nLeaving California? Here\u2019s a ranking of the best states \u00a0for relocation.\nSo, consider instead the hot industries in the two regions. San Jose is a tech hub and very friendly to remote work. Riverside is all about logistics, which is nearly impossible to do from home. In fact, warehousing and shipping help to power stay-at-home life. \nIn the San Jose market, it\u2019s estimated 48.5% of jobs can be done remotely \u2014 No. 1 among these 57 cities studied for congestion. Riverside? Just 29.6% of folks have work-for-home potential \u2014 tied for last with Grand Rapids, Mich., a historic factory town known as \u201cFurniture City.\u201d \nBigger trend\nA somewhat similar pattern was found in the nearby big cities. \nSan Francisco traffic was 21% congested in 2020 \u2014 with 42% fewer delays in a year, the No. 5 drop.

                "text": "An ice storm is a good indicator of a winter power outage. \n\nIt\u2019s a simple fact. Power outages happen. Any outage always presents challenges, but a winter power outage presents a whole new set of challenges. \nSome outages affect a city block, others a whole neighborhood or region. The cause is typically an ice storm, and the outages can be far-reaching.\u00a0In Quebec, Canada, an ice storm left millions without power for up to six months in the cold of the Canadian winter.\u00a0The result was a desperate lack of resources and support to any who needed any kind of assistance. \nPreparing for a Winter Power Outage\nA gas-powered generator with an ample supply of gas can make a lot of things easier. If you\u2019re really ambitious, you could have a gas-powered, whole house generator installed. If you\u2019re lacking both, you\u2019ll have to get resourceful \nHeat\nFireplace.\u00a0This is probably the most common heating alternative that people have in their homes. It\u2019s not as efficient as a wood-burning stove, but during a winter power outage, it\u2019s a welcome resource. The ability of a fireplace to provide heat to one room is significant, but you may find that other rooms don\u2019t receive as much heat depending on the size of your house. \nHowever, it will keep the rest of the house relatively above freezing, but I would hunker down with family next to the fireplace on couches and sleeping bags. You\u2019ll also want to open cabinets under sinks and make sure bathroom doors are open to prevent pipes from freezing. \nWood burning stove. Perhaps the best alternative heat source and capable of spreading heat beyond one room. \nBlack blankets in the sun. A curious suggesting from the Emergency Management Agency suggests putting black blankets on the floor where sunlight comes through the windows. The black color absorbs heat and will provide a bit of extra heat to the house. \nDangerous sources of heat include kerosene heaters, gas stoves or charcoal grills. They produce carbon monoxide over time. A gas range can be used occasionally for cooking, but should not be used as a heat source for a long duration. \nLighting\nFlashlights with plenty of backup batteries and candles are the lighting options of choice. LED flashlights are a good choice because of the amount of light they cast with a minimal power drain on batteries. \nWater\nIf your water is from a municipal water source, there\u2019s a good chance you\u2019ll still have water during a winter power outage. Municipal water is gravity-fed from tall water tanks, but they need to be refilled from time to time. If you have a well dependent on an electric pump, you\u2019ll have to find alternatives. \n\nStored and filled 5-gallon water bottles.\nMelt snow and ice in a 5-gallon bucket set in the sun indoors.\nIf you hear a weather report that portends the possibility of an outage, fill your bathtub with water but use it only for flushing the toilet. A bucket in the toilet will give it a good flush.\nAvoid frozen pipes by letting the faucets slowly drip if you are on municipal water. If the heat in your house is a problem and you have a well, you\u2019re wise to drain the pipes to prevent them from freezing.\n\nFood\n\nRefrigerator and freezer. Food will last in a refrigerator for 24 hours and in a freezer for 48 hours if you open the doors minimally. You also can place ice into plastic bags and turn your fridge/freezer into a large cooler. Alternatively, of course, you could place food outdoors \u2014 provided you take precautions to protect it from wildlife.\nStock up on foods that don\u2019t require refrigeration or freezing. It\u2019s easy to do. If it\u2019s on the shelf in a store, it will survive a power outage.\nYou have some options here:\n\nOutdoor on a grill\nOn a gas range\nOn top of the wood-burning stove\nNext to the fire in the fireplace in a Dutch oven\n\n\nRefrigerator realities\n\nSet to coldest settings if you suspect an outage is possible\nCoolers in the garage filled with plastic bags of snow and ice\nOutside in a snowdrift but beware the animals. Use a 5-gallon bucket with a locking lid\n\n\n\nCommunication\n\nCell phones and the charging challenge. It\u2019s hard to charge a cell phone without electricity, but you could use a car charger in the car, a solar charger about the size of a notebook, a generator or a cell charger power pack.\n\nBailing out\nIf you determine the situation is unbearable for you and your family, you\u2019ll need to bail out. This assumes you have somewhere to go that\u2019s at least comfortable like a neighbor, friend or family member who has better resources, or a local shelter housing people and families who are ill-equipped to handle the winter power outage. But before you bail, there are some steps you should take: \n\nDrain the water pipes\nTurn all of your circuit breakers to the off position. This will prevent a power surge when the power come back on.\u00a0In fact, some people take this step the minute a power outage occurs at any time of year except for a room with a few lamps to signal that the power is back on.\nPour anti-freeze into your toilets and drains for every sink, bathtub and shower\nMake sure all doors and windows are locked, and drapes and curtains drawn\nTake or dispose of any food in fridge or freezer or other perishables like bread\n\nPreparation is the key when it comes to a winter power outage\nAny power outage presents problems.\u00a0It\u2019s a good idea to think ahead to what alternative resources you will need during a power outage and make sure you have them in place. \nWhat tips would you add?

                "text": "Sally, the girls, and I just got back from a few days in Vermont.\u00a0 I went up with my buddy Josh early\u00a0Thursday morning, leaving the house at about 5:30 am and driving straight to Okemo Mountain, Vermont.\u00a0 We skied Okemo Thursday under flat, sometimes foggy conditions but had a really good time.\u00a0 The snow was decent if a little sparse in spots, and anyway, there wasn't much ice, so I can't complain.\u00a0 I feel like I rode pretty well.\u00a0 We packed in some 20 runs over the course of an uncrowded Thursday, getting in just under 19,700 vertical feet. Me and Josh at Okemo MountainThat absolutely rocked.  I gotta say, my favorite runs from Thursday were the ones where we got a little lost.\u00a0 The first time, we went from the top of the South Face down Rimrock\u00a0but somehow missed the Glades Peak Quad\u00a0and instead turned right down Sachem, a winding trail that leads through some of Okemo's condo developments, under a bridge, and all the way to the bunny slopes down by the Base Lodge.\u00a0 All told, that took us 20 minutes or more and saw a descent of at least 2000 vertical feet.\u00a0 Though Sachem\u00a0is a green trail towards the base of the Okemo Mountain, it's one of my absolute favorites. It's this winding, out of the way thing that really feels like a backwoods exploration. The other time we got lost -- lost-er, I should say -- we started over on the Jackson Gore Peak, went to the right down Tuckered Out, somehow hung a left at Espresso\u00a0and thus missed the quad lift, descended Spur Line, Fast Track,\u00a0and Inn Bound, and wound up at the Coleman Express Quad down by the Jackson Gore Parking Area.\u00a0 Oops.\u00a0 But yeah, that also took fully 20 minutes and saw us lose maybe 1500 or more vertical feet, though it then required two separate lifts to get back to the Jackson Gore summit. Jackson Gore Trail Map.\u00a0  We followed the left-hand trails all the way down. Obligatory selfie, at the Okemo Base Lodge just after lunch The Sunburst Six lift on our initial run up the mountain.My last note on Okemo is that we learned a trick while we were out there.\u00a0 The only lift that had any line whatsoever on Thursday was the Sunburst Six.\u00a0 We avoided that by taking the Black Ridge Triple, skiing down Double Dipper, and then hitting the Green Ridge Triple to the main summit.\u00a0 That probably wouldn't be worth it were the Six-lift running at capacity, but with coronavirus restrictions on lift capacity, it saved us half an hour or more going around that one single line. Following our 20-run marathon, Josh and I drove back to the Sterling Ski Club lodge at Mount Snow.\u00a0 Josh is just 32, and he'd crushed me through the first five or so runs Thursday morning, but I absolutely killed him through the next ten.\u00a0 The bad news is that my wife has been laid off twice this year from jobs at various Connecticut-based gyms.\u00a0 The upside, though, is that the last one let her take one of their spin bikes as a kind of severance since they were closing for good.\u00a0 I've been riding that thing several times per week over the past month or so, and at least on Thursday, all leg training really showed up. So.\u00a0 We got up comparatively late on Friday and drove a half-mile down the road to Mount Snow.\u00a0 Wound up putting in some 15 runs total over 15,300 vertical feet.\u00a0 It was a little icy over on the North Face, unfortunately, but we hit Beartrap\u00a0twice right after we got on the mountain, and I hit Olympic\u00a0twice once we worked our way over to the North Face.\u00a0 Olympic\u00a0was a lot less icy than Freefall\u00a0or Fallen Timbers.\u00a0 Happily, no one besides me wanted to go that far out of their way just to get in a run.\u00a0\u00a0 The Sunbrook Face.\u00a0 The leftmost trails are quite beautiful but rarely open. Josh at the top of the North Face. The Bluebird Express at Mount SnowOverall, though, my favorite part of the day was skiing down Cloud 9\u00a0on the Sunbrook face, though the Sunbrook lift was closed.\u00a0 We did that a couple of times but then had to take the Beartrap lift up to Long John, back around to the Main Lodge, and then up the Summit Express Quad.\u00a0 That's definitely the long way around, but it was worth it to hit those empty backside trails. Josh dropped me back at the lodge early Friday afternoon and then headed back home to meet up with his girlfriend.\u00a0 I cleaned up a little -- myself and the lodge -- and waited until Sally and the girls arrived Friday evening.\u00a0 We built a fire and had dinner while the kids ran around the lodge like maniacs.\u00a0 We then settled in to see how bad the snow would get before Saturday morning.\u00a0 We had reservations to ski again at Okemo, but the State of Vermont was by then under a heavy Winter Storm Warning.\u00a0 They were waiting on some 6 to 12 inches of snow, followed by rain, followed by more snow. Let me tell you, it turned out to be fully 12 inches of snow.\u00a0 We set out for Okemo at around 7:30 am, going maybe\u00a020 mph using our Honda's low-gear four-wheel drive setting.\u00a0 Even then, we didn't make it.\u00a0 Downed trees fell everywhere.\u00a0 A policeman finally stopped us and turned us around right around the halfway point, so we turned back, again inching our way south through what can only be described as extremely treacherous, blizzard conditions.\u00a0 An hour and forty minutes later, we arrived safely back at Mount Snow.\u00a0 I'd been fortunate to get enough cell service to cancel our reservations at Okemo and make new reservations at Snow, doubly so because some folks who'd planned to ski Snow had cancelled their own reservations, thus making room on the mountain for us.\u00a0\u00a0 I really have to hand it to Sally for the morning's driving.\u00a0 She drove through white-knuckled conditions for almost two full hours, keeping us safe and happy when it definitely did not have to go that way.\u00a0 We saw lot\u00a0of questionable driving decisions -- often with predictable outcomes -- but somehow managed to avoid all of it. Anyway, there we were, no shit, skiing Mount Snow with about 12 inches of very fresh, very wet, very heavy powder.\u00a0 Sally and the girls had never really seen anything like that, and I've only skied it rarely.\u00a0 We just don't get a lot of big powder days like that up in Vermont.\u00a0\u00a0 Needless to say, we fell a lot. Fun day, but a definite learning curve dealing with that heavy, wet pow, and by the time I made it over to the North Face, the whole side was covered with massively bumped-up whales.\u00a0 I fell so hard a couple of times, I felt like I'd gotten a chiropractic adjustment.\u00a0 I even somehow managed to dig an edge on top of one of those whales and launch myself face-first down the mountain.\u00a0 Needless to say, I'm a little sore right now. Obligatory selfie, at the Mount Snow's summit I took this from the lift on the North Face.\u00a0 Note the whales. Sally took this amazing shot from the Sunbrook lift. Another from the Sunbrook lift.\u00a0 Getting bumpy, but not quite to whales yet.Really good day, though.\u00a0 We started with a couple of laps on the south side, running Cloud 9\u00a0and Little Dipper\u00a0to Moonbeam, and that was a blast!\u00a0 Those trails are rarely open, but they're super-pretty, and they had really good snow yesterday.\u00a0 After that, I hit the North Face while Sally and the kids ran some greens, and then we closed with a run down Long John\u00a0to Nitro\u00a0and the terrain park.\u00a0 I got just 6 runs total over 5600 vertical feet, but man, I was twice as exhausted from those runs as I was from the previous two days.\u00a0 Working through that heavy-ass powder was no joke.",

                "title": "A Week, Briefly (1/11/21)",
                "text": "We are cleared of covid, so normal activities resumed--therapy, work, and more babies. It made it harder to keep up our outdoor adventures. Before they came back, we still hiked 3.8 miles on Monday at Watkins Mill and another 2 miles on Tuesday at Longview Lake, so we added 5.8 miles to our total for the year. 10.5 + 5.8 = 16.3 miles this year We took our time, stopping to observe and play as much as we wanted to along the way. MondayThere were hundreds of Canada Geese on the ice.\u00a0 They are a typical sight here, but en masse like this, they were breathtaking.\u00a0   Under this overlook, the river was frozen solid.\u00a0 The kids went down and skated for half an hour or more.\u00a0 Sir Walter Scott and I, along with Little Mister Frog, stayed off the ice.         We were specifically on the hunt for Bald Eagles that migrate across our area this time of year.\u00a0 It took the whole walk but as we reached the dam at the bottom of the lake, we spotted 2 eagles, flying so high it was hard to see their white heads.\u00a0 But we did see them!   TuesdayWe took the magnifying glass and some yarn on this walk.\u00a0 When we reached a likely spot, we defined a space with the yarn, then spent time exploring the site as closely as possible.\u00a0 We didn't explore that well.\u00a0 We'll try this one again another day.\u00a0 But the kids were pleased to find green grass and clover beneath the leaf cover.     A lot of snow melted on Monday!  WednesdayThis is the day everyone came back to our house! We did a lot of school, including a pretty cool moon craft, but the only outside time was an hour and a half or so in the late afternoon.  Little Mister Frog quite enjoyed this craft, because it involved stamping paint onto paper over and over again.\u00a0 Pounding things is a real joy for him. :)  They're very cool in real life.  And here are the books we've either read or are going to read in the week ahead.\u00a0 After this, we're going to let the moon and outer space fade out of our main focus and work on the character trait courage.  The Munchkin enjoyed our lesson about curly dock and bitter dock.\u00a0 He wanted to make pictures like the school kids were!  The absolute super most fun was having The Munchkin's baby sister, Sugar Bear, spend the day with us.We really hope she comes back to see us again! ThursdayEven though Sugar Bear didn't come back, we had a house full!!!\u00a0 Our beloved BCBS came for a final visit before she leaves for a new job; our regular RBT came over; and our new BCBS came for an initial visit. Whew!\u00a0 We had lessons about Thailand, constellations, and a review of general memory items from one of our Memoria Press recitation schedules.\u00a0 It was busy, fun, and exhausting.\u00a0 We've picked up our Around the World with Picture Books study again, and we've been reading about Thailand.\u00a0 When lunch didn't cook on time, I let the kids start watching The King and I.  The kids played outside in the late afternoon while I tidied up and cobbled a dinner together.\u00a0Then we finished The King and I at bedtime.\u00a0We also finished reading Steppin' and Family--such a sweet book about family love, reaching for dreams, and working hard.   We had some other finishers this week, too! This is a very gentle language arts program.\u00a0 Ladybug worked through it at double pace in order to be introduced to 3rd grade language arts concepts in preparation for a more rigorous 3rd grade program to follow.\u00a0 For Ladybug, repetition is key.  Ladybug also finished this cursive practice book.\u00a0 She has truly lovely cursive handwriting.  And Brother finished his first unit workbook (out of 5) in this reading program.\u00a0 It's long, hard work for him, and this is a real accomplishment!\u00a0 He's happily begun unit 2; having a new workbook is really energizing for him.  In addition to all of that finishing, we started reading A Child's First Book of American History . . . this is because we finished reading Our Star Spangled Story last week.  FridayI'd planned to go on a big hike, but the snow storm that came through (we only caught the edge of it) had a daunting feel to it.\u00a0 It felt like night all day long--even the chickens refused to come out of the coop until Sir Walter Scott opened all of the doors and windows and shooed them out into the yard. Instead, we caught up on chores and made our service project cards for police officers.\u00a0\u00a0  \u00a0Here are a few of the cards:   Then we read a book about snowflakes and ran outside to catch them on black paper and study them under a magnifying glass.      Little Princess got the camera and took this fascinating picture of snow on our van:  She tried to show me how she did it, but I didn't understand. :)   Beowulf continues to improve his coping and focusing skills.\u00a0 It is so exciting to see him succeed!  And I never, ever get tired of watching siblings help one another. \u00a0\u00a0We began a darling read aloud book set in Thailand called Tua and the Elephant.\u00a0 I also began reading The Aeneid so that Belle has something more at her level for listening and so that the younger kids have something to help them calm down after the intensity of Roll of Thunder, Hear My Cry.\u00a0 Lots of conversations about slavery, equality, justice, and skin color have been inspired by this powerful read aloud.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The kids were scrubbing some mud off the mudroom floor, and one of them said, \"This is like being a slave.\"\u00a0Another child answered, \"But if we were slaves, then [Baymax] wouldn't be scrubbing with us.\u00a0 He'd be telling us what to do.\"\u00a0I walked through the room dropping a simple thought, \"Aren't we glad that it doesn't matter what color skin we have?\u00a0 We can all help one another!\"  \u00a0How I wish I had a more just world to offer my children!\u00a0\u00a0This weekend, Beowulf is going to be baptized.And then Pixie is leaving to move back to Idaho.\u00a0 This will be a more permanent move than just going off to school.\u00a0 She has a full-time job for her off-semester that will allow her to work part-time when she's on-track.\u00a0 She'll come home for Christmas each year, but I think that's about it.\u00a0 She's the first one to really, truly move out, and I'm feeling the bitter-sweetness of it deep in my heart. Parenting is truly not for the faint of heart.",

                "title": "California prepares for damaging winds this week",
                "text": "By Haley Brink | CNN Meteorologist\nCalifornia could be facing the strongest wind event of the season starting Sunday night, forecasters say. \nStrong, damaging winds are expected to begin across portions of Northern and central California as early as Sunday night and are expected to last through Wednesday. \nHigh-wind alerts are in effect for over 30 million people from north-central California down to Southern California. \n\nThe set up\nA strong area of high pressure will build across the Northwest on Sunday evening and into Monday, this area of high pressure will shift into the Great Basin by Tuesday. While this area of high pressure builds, an area of low pressure will develop off the southern coast of California. \nThe proximity and strength of the two systems is important. This is known as the pressure gradient, which is forecast to be quite strong and will cause these intense winds to develop early this week. \nWinds flow from areas of high pressure to areas of low pressure, so in this instance the winds for this event are expected to be offshore winds, when the wind moves from land out to sea. Locally across different areas of California these wind events are often referred to as\u201d\u2018Diablo winds,\u201d \u201cMono winds,\u201d or \u201cSanta Ana winds.\u201d \nTiming\nAreas of Northern and central California are forecast to experience these strong winds first, arriving late on Sunday and lasting through Tuesday. \n\u201cGusts in populated areas may reach into the 30 mph range while in the hills and mountains, gusts into 40s and possible 50 mph range. Prepare now,\u201d the National Weather Service office in San Francisco said on Saturday evening. \nThe strongest winds across Northern and central California are expected to develop Monday night into Tuesday morning. \n\u201cWe are gaining more confidence that widespread sustained NE winds of 35 to 55 mph will be possible with gusts of 70 to 80 mph, strongest below and through passes and canyons,\u201d the NWS office in Los Angeles said Saturday afternoon. \nThe strongest winds across Southern California are expected on Tuesday. \nWinds this strong could lead to downed trees and powerlines, power outages, and potentially widespread critical fire weather conditions across much of the state. \nFire weather\nTypical fire weather conditions across areas of Southern California are fueled by a combination of above average temperatures, low humidity values, dry vegetation, and strong winds. The developing low pressure off the Southern California coast could limit some of these factors, bringing with it cooler temperatures and higher humidity values. Due to this, fire weather conditions could be somewhat limited early this week. \nHowever, many locations across Southern California, including Los Angeles, have not seen measurable rain since the end of December, meaning the vegetation across the region has had over two weeks to dry out. \nSouthern California has also experienced record heat over the last several days, in addition to the growing drought across the region. \nWhen you factor in dry vegetation, drought conditions, and strong winds all it takes is one spark for a fire to begin and spread rapidly. The Storm Prediction Center has not ruled out the chance for critical fire weather conditions, especially on Monday. \n\u201cConfidence in the wind forecast remains fairly high, but colder air advecting into the region will begin a cooling trend that will improve RH (relative humidity) values during the forecast period,\u201d the Storm Prediction Center said on Sunday morning. \nRelated Articles\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\tNo rain expected for the next 10 days as temperatures go up across the Bay Area\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\tAvalanche warning, winter weather advisory for Lake Tahoe\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\tMap: Bay Area storm tracker, plus the weather warnings in effect\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\tRain soaks Bay Area, but totals in most places are small\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\tNew Year\u2019s showers in the Bay Area a fresh start after historically dry 2020\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\nThe SPC also said these humidity values could fall into the teens in some locations due to downsloping winds \u2014 dry winds that flow from east to west through the mountain passes in California \u2014 which could lead to a few hours of critical fire weather conditions on Monday afternoon. \nThis area of low pressure will however bring some much needed rain and snow to portions of the Southwest over the next few days, which will help toward lowering the widespread drought conditions across the region. \nThe-CNN-Wire & \u00a9 2021 Cable News Network, Inc., a WarnerMedia Company.

It always amazes me to see how dedicated some people are regardless of the challenges awaiting them. \n \n \nMany of our patients would have been looking forward to their treatment on Thursday before the snow storm arrived. Although we completely understand that some patients would not be able to make the journey, we were pleasantly surprised to see how many actually did make it! One patient travelled all the way from Sheffield to attend early for her 9am appointment as she looked forward to having her dental implant treatment completed. She also surprised the whole team with a box of doughnuts which is an incredibly thoughtful gesture, especially when you consider all of the other challenges facing her on the way to the clinic. \nWe also had patients arrive all the way from Hull for their treatment despite the longer journey times caused by the weather and traffic. Another patient walked over 7 miles in the snow and when I asked him why didn\u2019t he just reschedule his appointment he said, \u201cI really want my teeth sorting and coming here today has been worth it.\u201d \nIt is moments like this that we all remember. The dedication shown by everyone is relentless. It isn\u2019t just on snowy days, it is everyday that we see this and I guess it is highlighted more during exceptional circumstances like this one. \nEvery patient that attended was met by our full team. Everyone made a huge effort to get their on time to ensure that our patients would be provided the service they deserve. It makes me very proud to be part of a team that is so reliable and dedicated. \nWhatever the challenge that is thrown at us, a pandemic or a snow storm, we will always turn up and do our best for our patients. \nMohsin Patel \nThe post Whatever the weather\u2026 appeared first on Infinity Dental Clinic.",

                "text": "In the past I've written various horror stories centered around or themed from certain holidays like Christmas, Easter, Thanksgiving and of course, Halloween. Even my erotic horror novella, Roseblood, was somewhat inspired by Valentine's Day.\u00a0 Recently during this colder than normal Florida winter, we had frost and some folks having to scrape off windshields early in the morning. We can get tiny snow flakes but more northern Florida and if the weather conditions are right for it. We rarely get enough to make a small snowman. It'd be easier going to the beach to build a sandman version.\u00a0 So the wheels were spinning one frosty morning (see what I did there?) and the story below came to be. Originally, I'd imagined two brothers for this tale, but opted for sisters instead because I've found myself enjoying writing about female characters more.\u00a0 Also, after I'd written this, it became somewhat obvious that I'd been channeling my inner John Urbancik. It seemed like something he'd write, and if you haven't checked out his work yet, I'd highly recommend you unfuck that pronto. He's one of the most talented writers of dark fantasy and horror fiction around.\u00a0        Reign of the Winter King Copyright 2021  Once upon a time there were two sisters, each a year apart, who were enjoying the first big snowfall of the year. It had been a chilly winter and while it had been a cold Christmas the week before, it hadn't been a white one.\u00a0 Then a week after the Yuletide holiday, the snow came and where they lived, it had been the first significant snow storm in a decade. They'd been too little to remember when the snow had fallen the last time. Excited by the prospect of donning heavy coats and gloves and boots, they dashed out into the mid morning backyard to check it out and marvel at the blanket of near blinding white that had covered the ground around the house and surrounding woods. It was breathtaking! They scooped up handfuls of snow and tossed them at each other and took turns laying in it to make snow angels. Suddenly, the older sister, Kristine, had an idea. \"Hey, lets make a snowman!\" Her younger sister clapped her snow-flecked gloved hands in delight. \"Yeah, that would be awesome!\" So as they hunkered down and began to gathered up huge handfuls of snow and formed the big round base of the snowman's bottom half, Kristine had another idea. She didn't want to make the traditional and common snowman that most kids did. Their snowman would be much better than that. He'd be grand, noble...and he would be the King of the Snowmen.\u00a0 He'll be the...Winter King! Kristine thought and smiled. She shared that with her sister. \"Whoa, sis...that's freaking perfect!\" Kristine was always reading books and had the more imaginative creative mind. But her sister said she'd be right back, had to go get something from her room, and went inside their house. Minutes later, as Kristine continued working on the snowman, the Winter King, her sister came back holding a silver toy crown. It was made of plastic but embedded with red rubies and jade gemstones, all fake of course, and while it had faded a little bit, it still looked useable. Her little sister had found it in the woods behind her house a few years ago and thought it looked cool. Kristine had suggested it probably belonged to some neighborhood kids who sometimes played in the woods. \"Remember this thing? Bet it belongs to him now,\" she proclaimed as she held it up. \"The crown of the Winter King!\" Kristine laughed and her sister got down on her knees as they continued putting together their snowman. It took a while, longer than they figured and an hour later, the Winter King was brought back to life. He had two twisted arms from a couple medium sized but thick fallen tree branches and they used small stones for his eyes and another chunk of rock for his nose. His mouth was made from a small twig with a slight curve like a wicked grin.\u00a0 Then Kristine let her sister place the crown upon his head. They clapped and cheered aloud.\u00a0 \"All hail the Winter King! Long may he reign!\" Kristine cried out in a deep voice.\u00a0 Her sister echoed the declaration. Suddenly, a deeper voice called out. \"What's the deal with the snowman? And that thing on his head doesn't belong to you, either.\" Both sisters swiveled their heads around toward the snowy woods to see three teenage boys emerge. Dressed like the girls for the cold weather, they wore smirks and sneers of derision across their reddened pale faces. Their \"leader\" stood in front and gestured again at the Winter King. \"That crown is mine. Lost it in the woods a while back. So...give it back.\" They knew the boys as being a group of slightly older boys, usually up to no good both at school and home. They had a bad rep around the neighborhood as bullies but had pretty much left the sisters alone.\u00a0 Until today. The leader moved forward and stepped over to grab the crown off the Winter King's head. But Kristine intercepted him and prevented him from touching it by blocking his path with her tall, willowy body.\u00a0 \"No, you don't,\" she said.\u00a0 The leader frowned and his cronies chuckled darkly. Then he shoved her aside and snatched the crown. Cristine fell sideways, thrusting one arm out in reflex, and one of the tree branch arms whacked her face, splitting open her bottom lip. She collided with the Winter King and he toppled over and she fell atop him. Her sister yelled and bent over to scoop up snow, compacting it into hard balls and hurled it at the laughing boys. She hit them a few times as they retreated back into the woods. Then she helped her sister to her feet. Her sister's lip bled down her chin. \"You okay, sis?\" Kristine wiped at her bloody lip and bit back the sobs of frustration and embarrassment. Usually it was she who defended her younger sister not the other way around. But she'd been grateful. She told her she was fine, but they needed to fix the snowman first. They hurriedly put the Winter King back together, slightly disappointed and dispirited because he no longer wore his crown. Some of Kristine's blood had stained his body but they agreed it seemed fitting somehow. Then they both had needed to go back inside to warm up and drink hot tea or cocoa.\u00a0 The weather worsened and both sisters hadn't ventured back outside that day. They'd not forgotten about the Winter King and checked on him a few times by looking out a window. They were pleased to see the bullies hadn't returned to destroy him. However, they might do that once night fell. Sadly, he didn't look quite so noble without his silver crown of jewels even if those were fake plastic ones. The next morning, more snow had came overnight and both sisters decided they'd wait a while before going outside. They'd told their parents about the scuffle with the bullies and their Dad wanted to report them to the police, but Kristine asked him to let it go.\u00a0 Their father told them over his morning coffee and newspaper that they must've had a change of heart after getting what had been coming to them. He chuckled and sipped from his mug. \"What do you mean, Dad?\" Kristine asked curiously. Her sister asked him the same thing. He shrugged and pointed with his mug. \"Go see for yourselves. Your snow king got his crown back. And it wasn't me, I swear.\" They both went to the back window overlooking the snowy yard behind the house and sure enough, the Winter King sat proudly wearing his rightful silver crown. His twig mouth seemed to grin even wider. Wickedly, almost. Both sisters had no idea why the three ruffians would do that, but they swore it had to be their father. He probably visited their parents and got the toy crown back after explaining what had transpired. They only hoped his intervening wouldn't result in further retaliation.\u00a0 Nothing untoward occured but curiously, once they returned to school after the holiday break, Kristine had found out something very interesting. Very interesting, indeed. One of her classmates and friends was telling her about how she'd heard the trio of wannabe thugs had been hanging out in the woods last week when they'd been attacked. They'd suffered from cuts and bruises, but not so bad that they needed to go to the clinic. At least not that they'd admitted to anyway. The bizarre thing about it, her friend told her, was that they claimed it had been a big snow monster.\u00a0 Kristine did her best to hide the look of shock and surprise. She'd nearly gasped. Her friend noticed something and asked if she was okay. \"I'm fine,\" she replied and couldn't wait to tell her younger sister. But she could barely suppress her own wicked grin.\u00a0 Winter eventually moved into early spring and because of that the Winter King did melt away. Both sisters had been a little sad to see him go, but they saved the silver crown.\u00a0 After all, winter would come back. And so would its King.",

Nothing like \u2018the beast from the east\u2019 but still enough to get the majority of us excited. \n\n\n\nToday we took the opportunity to visit Red bridge Park  an area between the areas of Costessey and Hellesdon  of Norwich.  Now there are ways in which to enter this area however if you want to park closest to the bridge itself use the postcode NR50AG or search \u2018Red Bridge park\u2019 in your satnav, following the dirt track you\u2019ll find a small car park just on your left.  \n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\nFollowing the path down from the car park towards the river you are met with an area which in the summer is perfect for picnics by the river and a paddle, not something we you\u2019d want to do when its -1 as it was when we visited. However the snow brings an entirely new scenery  and transforms it into somewhere new to explore.  \n\n\n\nRiver Tud\n\n\n\nI\u2019ll be honest in relation to the \u2018walk\u2019 we kept it brief, just below a mile as you can see by the map below. This was probably for the best as by half way round the novelty of the snow had worn off and the reality of having freezing finger tips and toes was all to obvious for the youngest. For those who want to take this walk any further, once through the main \u2018Red Bridge Park\u2019 area and onto Marriott\u2019s way, you are able to either walk Eastwards towards Norwich, or West which ultimately goes to Aylsham \u2013 Something which is on my to do list for this year.  \n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\nAs we walked along the River Tud, the river was racing by, almost turbo charged by the sudden blast of snow we were receiving. In areas along the path the banks had burst and areas that were once greenery became ponds on their own.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI am glad we got down to \u2018Red Bridge Park\u2019 before lunch time as as always the long overdue \u2018snow storm\u2019 was just a little flurry which dissipated just hours later. Overall though seeing snow and getting an opportunity to take a walk around the woodlands was a nice bit of variety, seeing the children play on sledges and making snowmen was a well needed break. For a period of time, surrounded by the falling snow, everything seemed normal. Following this we took the opportunity to go to the local baker \u2018Easters Bakery\u2019 to indulge on a selection of pastries and cakes which warmed us all up \u2013 something we highly recommend if you are in the area!  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOverall Red Bridge Park, is a lovely place to visit, in the summer it provides a perfect place for the whole family to take a dip in a clean (as clean as you get in the UK) river whilst enjoying a picnic on the surrounding grass areas, in the winter, particularly during snow you are spoilt with meandering paths through woodlands, river views and surrounding meadows. We therefore recommend this all year round. As always, thank you for taking the time to check out this weeks post, while your here take the opportunity to have a look at our other adventures, or follow the link to our Facebook and Instagram pages for more content.   \n\n\n\nStay Safe- Norfolk Explorers",

Being out was just great. \n\n\n\nToday is my mother\u2019s 101st birthday. One would think that as the grief fades, her memory would likewise fade. Not so, in fact, I think of her more and more. More and more, I find myself doing things or saying things she would say. I want to ask her advice more and more. I want to know more about her life.\u00a0 \n\n\n\nWork on Compass Point is slow. I find I have tolerance for about one chapter at a time. I\u2019m not sure if it is staring at the screen that is my problem, or the fact that I am fixing problems that I feel I shouldn\u2019t have made in the first place. I know all writers need editors, that we simply do not see everything, but sometimes I am so frustrated when I come to a silly mistake I shouldn\u2019t have made or should have seen in the multitude of times I have been through the manuscript. Fresh eyes\u2014more eyes all make for a better story. I know this. Still. Aren\u2019t you lucky? This blog gets no such polish. Unvarnished words only on these pages. \n\n\n\nIs it spring yet? \n\n\n\nI just looked out the windows and saw that the clouds were racing past at an incredible pace. Whoa. Does that mean a storm? I am imagining a spring storm, of course, but I suppose it would be considered a winter storm since it\u2019s still only January. One could hope. Hope and patience are two things to come out of 2020. I\u2019m being patient for a vaccine, and I\u2019m hopeful for a calmer world. Won\u2019t it be great when we can turn our attention to bettering our soil and the air we breathe?

                "title": "KRANJSKA GORA GS: Bassino wins twice, Canada\u2019s Gray shines in debut",
                "text": "Whistler, B.C.- When Maribor was unable to host World Cup Giant Slalom races due to high temperatures, FIS was pressed at the last minute to relocate to Kranjska Gora, Slovenia, one of the more challenging hills on the men\u2019s World Cup circuit. It was a surprise, but by the weekend\u2019s end, a welcome one for Marta Bassino, as well as Team Canada.\u00a0 \n\n\n\nItaly\u2019s Marta Bassino continued her dominance in G.S., starting on Saturday with a win by 8/10ths of a second and following it up with a second victory on Sunday, by 6.6/10th. Bassino\u2019s wins were her third and fourth of the G.S. season, after winning in Soelden, Austria and Courchevel, France. \n\n\n\nBassino (FIS)\n\n\n\nRacers fought through harsh conditions on both days, but moreso Saturday. \u201cIt was tough. It was icy,\u201d said Saturday\u2019s winner to the Associated Press. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to push because you feel the ski slide a little bit.\u201d \n\n\n\nThe Italian has stood on the podium\u2019s top step in each of the races this season, other than once in Courchevel, where USA\u2019s Mikaela Shiffrin took home the gold medal. After five G.S. races, Shiffrin and Bassino are the only ones with wins in their back pockets.\u00a0 \n\n\n\nWhen she won her second race in as many days, Bassino could not find the words to describe how she felt. \u201cIt\u2019s so amazing; I am so emotional, it is so amazing, it is like a dream, I can\u2019t believe it,\u201d she managed to say to the FIS reporter before breaking down full of emotion.\u00a0 \n\n\n\nMichelle Gisin (FIS)\n\n\n\nFrance\u2019s Tessa Worley won Saturday\u2019s second run but still finished behind Bassino, while Switzerland\u2019s Michele Gisin picked up her first podium in G.S. Shiffrin. The Swiss skier returned to the podium Sunday in second place, while Meta Hrovat won bronze on her home hill in Slovenia.\u00a0 \n\n\n\nSlovakia\u2019s Petra Vlhova, who got off to a hot start to the season, has cooled down, only reaching the podium in one of the last 11 World Cup events. In Semmering, Austria, she led the G.S. race, but the event was cancelled before the second run due to high winds. Mikaela Shiffrin, who has won 68 World Cup events, finished sixth on both days, despite being ahead of Bassino after Sunday\u2019s opening run.\u00a0 \n\n\n\nCanada and Cassidy Gray\n\n\n\nWhile the racers jockeying for medals are always a point of interest, the big story this weekend was the emergence of Cassidy Gray, Canada\u2019s 19-year-old, who took the Slovenian slope by storm. From Panorama, B.C, Gray made her debut as the 58th skier out of the gate, but the 2001-born racer threw down a clean, attacking run that put her into the second run in her debut. Working your way from 58th into the Top-30 is an achievement for anyone, but in a debut? That\u2019s nearly unheard of.\u00a0 \n\n\n\nValerie Grenier (Agence Zoom)\n\n\n\nValerie Grenier, 24, made her debut at 18 and helped Gray through her first World Cup race day. Grenier herself, who has been focusing on G.S. this season, found her way into Saturday and Sunday\u2019s second runs as well. Grenier finished 16th on Saturday and 15th on Sunday.\u00a0 \n\n\n\nUnfortunately for Gray, she did not finish her second run on Saturday. She did not earn points, but despite that, just qualifying for Run #2 gave her lots of attention, recognition and excitement. She once again fought her way into Run #2 on Sunday and made it to the finish line, picking up points in 26th place.\u00a0 \n\n\n\n(Alpine Canada)\n\n\n\nIt has been a long time since Canada has had a racer with so much potential and excitement after a debut, making Gray\u2019s emergence all the more compelling. However, as a student-athlete racing NCAA at the University of Colorado, it will likely be a few seasons before Gray is on the World Cup full-time.\u00a0 \n\n\n\n\u00a0Next: G.S. \u2013 Kronplatz, Italy \u2013 Jan. 23\n\n\n\nThe women\u2019s tech tour moves onto Kronplatz, Italy, for a single G.S. on January 26th. Back in Italy, the likes of Marta Bassino will feel right at home, as skiers, high-ranking and low-ranking, prepare for the World Championships, which are less than a month away in Cortina d\u2019Ampezzo. Before that, however, the FIS Women\u2019s Alpine World Cup will speed down hills in Crans Montana, Switzerland, next weekend with Super-G and Dowhill.",

Frederick?\u2019 Anne sent Elizabeth a frantic look as the captain\u2019s eyes closed, and he became very still again. \u2018Will he stay with us?\u2019 \nElizabeth had no answer to that. \u2018Moisten his lips and just keep talking to him.\u2019 \nAnne turned back to the captain and pressed the wet cloth to his mouth. \u2018We are at Kellynch, Frederick. Well, on the estate, at least. They brought you here because you mentioned it, and you also spoke..\u2026\u2019 She swallowed hard. \u2018You said my name.\u2019 \n\u2018Anne.\u2019 The sound was barely a whisper, but it gave them hope, and a few moments later, Captain Wentworth\u2019s lids lifted a little. Then, he made a guttural sound, and his arms began flailing, his face distorted. \u2018The water! So cold\u2026My men\u2026I cannot breathe. I cannot help them\u2026\u2019 Just as suddenly, his arms dropped heavily onto the bed, his breathing ragged. \n\u2018What shall we do?\u2019 Anne\u2019s voice was frantic. \u2018He is in distress!\u2019 \nElizabeth placed a hand upon her friend\u2019s back. \u2018He is coming to life. Can you not hear his breathing?\u2019 \nAnne\u2019s frame shuddered under Elizabeth\u2019s hand, but she nodded, her attention fixed upon the man in the bed. How long they remained like so, Elizabeth was unsure, but then, the captain\u2019s eyes opened again, more fully this time. \n\u2018Need\u2026a drink,\u2019 he rasped. \nA suppressed sob came from Anne. \u2018Yes, yes. I have more of the barley water.\u2019 \nCaptain Wentworth pulled a face. \u2018Brandy.\u2019 \nElizabeth pursed her lips to keep from smiling, as she handed the cup to Anne again before going over to the box of supplies left by the apothecary\u2014supplies no one had expected to need. She returned with a small bottle of cordial, which Mr Robinson had asked them to administer if the sick man came around, watching as Anne helped the captain drink some more, then offering the bottle to her. \n\u2018You must take a little of this now, Frederick.\u2019 \nThe captain spluttered as the liquid hit the back of his throat. \u2018What the\u2026?\u2019 \n\u2018It is a restorative cordial.\u2019 \nHe pulled a face again. \u2018I cannot stomach the stuff.\u2019 \n\u2018This is on the apothecary\u2019s orders.\u2019 Anne persevered, then slowly lowered his head to the pillows. \n\u2018My men\u2026the water closed over my head and I could not see them. Blackness\u2026\u2019 The captain had closed his eyes again, but his brow was furrowed. \n\u2018What do I tell him?\u2019 Anne whispered to Elizabeth, but she shook her head. \n\u2018Do not speak of it, for we know so little and you can say naught of any comfort.\u2019 \nBefore Anne had need of words however, the captain spoke again. \n\u2018I had such\u2026dreams.\u2019 His voice held hardly any timbre, and Anne leaned in closer to discern it. \u2018Lost\u2026\u2019 He turned his head from side to side on the pillow. \u2018Thought\u2026lost\u2026\u2019 \n\u2018You were saved, Frederick. They pulled you from the sea and brought you back to land.\u2019 \nThe captain\u2019s frown deepened, then he pouted like a little boy, and Elizabeth had to bite her lip. It was not a laughing moment, after all. \n\u2018Not me. Lost\u2026you\u2026I thought\u2026\u2019 He tried to raise his head in his agitation, and Anne placed a hand on his arm to calm him, leaning in closer so that he could hear her. \n\u2018Now is not the time to worry about dreams. You must get well.\u2019 Her eyes were clouded with anxiety. \u2018Does he not recall? I must\u2014\u2019 \n\u2018What I must have is a kiss.\u2019 The captain\u2019s voice was plaintive, and Anne stared at Elizabeth, who was torn between tears and laughter at the expression on her friend\u2019s face. \n\u2018Humour him,\u2019 she whispered, tapping her cheek, and Anne turned back to the bed. \n\u2018There\u2019\u2014she placed a gentle kiss upon the captain\u2019s whiskery face. \u2018Now you must rest whilst we await the apothecary.\u2019 \nCaptain Wentworth\u2019s eyes remained closed, but the hint of a smile graced his features. \n\u2018Again.\u2019 \nAnne hesitated, then leaned forward, but as her mouth neared his cheek, the captain turned his head on the pillow and pressed his lips to hers. \nElizabeth looked away for her friend\u2019s sake, adding, \u2018He is disorientated.\u2019 \n\u2018Who\u2026who is there, Anne?\u2019 \n\u2018It is my friend, Miss Elizabeth Bennet.\u2019 \n\u2018Then\u2026\u2019 He attempted to clear his throat. \u2018I trust she will forgive me.\u2019 \n\u2018She will, but all the same, you should not\u2014\u2019 \nThe captain made a weak movement with his arm, which then dropped heavily onto the coverlet. \u2018Why should I not? A man\u2019\u2014he cleared his throat again\u2014\u2018may kiss his betrothed if he so chooses.\u2019 \nAnne gasped. \u2018Oh, but you and I are not\u2014\u2019 \n\u2018Alone, remember?\u2019 Elizabeth finished, though the captain had closed his eyes again and was probably insensible to their words. \nShe took Anne\u2019s arm and persuaded her away from the bed. \n\u2018He needs peace and comfort just now.\u2019 Elizabeth spoke quietly. \u2018Follow what his dreams have told him.\u2019 \nAnne shook her head. \u2018How can I? It is my dream he is lost in.\u2019 \n\u2018You will not aid the captain by revealing the truth just now. He is too weak to even turn his back, never mind stalk out of the room. Just bear with it for now.\u2019 \nAnne\u2019s attention was fixed on the captain. \u2018Do you think\u2026 he is not unconscious again?\u2019 \nStepping closer, Elizabeth studied the face upon the pillow and the rise and fall of the sheet on Captain Wentworth\u2019s chest. \u2018I am no expert on such matters, but I believe he sleeps of his own will. I must inform Mrs Reynolds.\u2019 \nShe turned to leave, but Anne grasped her arm. \u2018You cannot go!\u2019 \nElizabeth embraced her friend.\u00a0 \u2018Do not fret so. The man has received a severe blow to his head and received no sustenance for days on end. He certainly cannot be held accountable for a little delirium on first waking.\u2019 \nShe walked over to the door. \u2018I shall leave this ajar and send a maid to wait with you. And keep talking to him, Anne. Your voice will bring him comfort.\u2019 \nAnne did as she was bid, and Elizabeth, unable to locate a servant nearby, headed down the stairs, a myriad of thoughts whirling through her mind. \nCaptain Wentworth\u2019s rousing was both unexpected and a blessing.\u00a0Whether it would sustain should be swiftly determined, she assumed, but the implications for Anne were profound, especially if the gentleman persisted in his belief that they were still engaged. \nAs she reached the hall, Elizabeth stopped as a disturbing thought encroached upon her speculation. Mr Darcy could not have anticipated this, much as he might wish for the captain to recover. He had been more than gracious, but that had been when the prognosis implied no more than a night\u2019s inconvenience. What now? \nElizabeth turned around in a circle. Where should she go? She had only seen the drawing room. Then, she noticed the door to the service areas, and as there was as much chance as any that Mrs Reynolds would be down there, she set off towards it. \n\u2018Miss Bennet?\u2019 Georgiana had emerged from a door to Elizabeth\u2019s left. \u2018Is all well?\u2019 \n\u2018Good morning, Miss Darcy. I trust your health continues to improve?\u2019 \n\u2018Indeed. Beyond a trifling cough, I am quite well. How is\u2026Mrs Reynolds said there was some change and has sent for the apothecary.\u2019 \nElizabeth smiled as Georgiana approached her. \u2018We may have turned a corner. The captain has awakened and seems a little confused but is now sleeping.\u2019 \nClasping her hands together, Georgiana returned the smile. \u2018Oh, that is news I dared not hope for!\u2019 Her expression sobered. \u2018Are you looking for my brother?\u2019 \n\u2018In truth, I sought word of when Mr Robinson might arrive. With hindsight, Mr Darcy ought not to be the last to know of this alteration.\u2019 \n\u2018Then we had best seek him out.\u2019 Georgiana gestured along the hallway, and Elizabeth fell into step beside her.\u00a0\u2018Fitz has been in his study since coming back from his ride.\u2019 \n\u2018You and your brother have been most accommodating, Miss Darcy. I do not think I, and certainly, Miss Elliot, can thank you enough.\u2019 \nGeorgiana stopped, and through necessity so did Elizabeth.\u00a0 \u2018My brother\u2026\u2019 She hesitated. \u2018He has been brought low with worry and concern of late.\u2019 \n\u2018I am sorry to hear it.\u2019 Elizabeth hoped the young girl was not going to blurt out words Mr Darcy would wish she had not. \nThe girl was clearly uncomfortable. \u2018There are matters I cannot\u2026I must not speak of.\u2019 \nElizabeth was unsure this warranted an answer, but Georgiana seemed to labour under some anxiety. \n\u2018You are a good sister, I think.\u2019 To Elizabeth\u2019s dismay, this did not bring comfort. \n\u2018I am not. I do not deserve Fitz. He is the best of men, and the most attentive of brothers.\u2019 \nThe latter was true. Elizabeth could not fault anything she had seen in Mr Darcy as a brother. \u2018It is quite natural, Miss Darcy, to feel for our siblings when we are powerless to aid them.\u2019 \nGeorgiana seemed thoughtful as they resumed their walk.\u00a0\u2018Do you experience this also, Miss Bennet, with regard to your own sister?\u2019 \nElizabeth slowed to a halt, and Georgiana turned to face her, colour filling her cheeks. \n\u2018Forgive me. I know now I spoke out of turn the other day, about Mr Bingley. My brother explained, but I\u2026\u2019 \nShe fell silent as a door opened behind them. \n\u2018Georgiana?\u2019 Mr Darcy emerged from his study, frowning. \u2018Miss Bennet? Is there a problem?\u2019 \n\u2018No, Fitz. Miss Bennet has news.\u2019 Georgiana threw Elizabeth a conscious look. \u2018I will advise Mrs Reynolds.\u2019 \nWith that, she hurried back along the corridor, leaving Elizabeth trying to decipher what Georgiana might have been about to say. She had a strong suspicion she comprehended something of the disagreement between herself and Mr Darcy. \n\u2018Miss Bennet?\u2019 \n\u2018Oh, yes! There was a change in the captain\u2019s condition, a positive one, and Mrs Reynolds has sent for Mr Robinson again.\u2019 \nDarcy gestured along the hallway and they walked back in the direction Elizabeth had just come. \u2018Then he should be here directly.\u2019 \nAs they reached the main entrance hall, Elizabeth came to a decision. \n\u2018Mr Darcy, should the captain recover\u2014and I pray to the Lord he does\u2014you may be obliged to extend your kindness in sheltering both the gentleman and Miss Anne Elliot a while longer.\u2019 Elizabeth\u2019s gaze raked his face, trying to discern his feelings but his habitual mask was firmly in place. \u2018I appreciate my being here has been difficult in the light of our\u2026\u2019 What on earth could one call it? \u2018Our discussion the other day. You will wish me to leave for Hertfordshire at the earliest convenience.\u2019 \nWas he glaring at her? Elizabeth cast around for other words. \n\u2018Not content with revealing what you think of me, Miss Bennet, you now wish to put words in my mouth?\u2019 \n\u2018No! I did not mean\u2014\u2019 \nElizabeth stopped as Mrs Reynolds came into the hall with Boliver, who assisted Mr Darcy into his great coat. \n\u2018You will have to excuse me, madam. I am due up at the Hall.\u2019 With that, the gentleman took his hat and gloves from his butler and strode towards the door. \nConfused as to why her words had raised Mr Darcy\u2019s ire, Elizabeth\u2019s puzzled gaze followed him. What was his meaning? How could he not want her to depart as soon as possible? \nUnable to account for such a notion, Elizabeth summoned a smile for the housekeeper. She would dwell upon Mr Darcy another time. For now, all her interest must be for her friend and the prompt return of Mr Robinson. \n~o0o~ \nAnne had been staring with rapt attention at Captain Wentworth. Though five years had passed, he was as handsome as she remembered, despite the facial hair and the bruise upon his forehead. Full of thanks as she was for his awakening, however, Anne\u2019s head was a complete muddle. \nFrederick speaking her name in his delirium she negated, for it could be accounted for by all manner of things, but now this! How could he think the engagement persisted, when it could not be farther from the truth? \nWary of touching him now he had been conscious, Anne eased away from the edge of the bed, then got to her feet and walked over to stare out of the window. The sky was a heavy grey, indicative of further snow, and she shivered. What would happen now? \nIf Frederick recovered, he would soon realise his mistake, remember the angry words exchanged between them, judge her once more with the disbelief and disfavour of five years ago. Though it was a memory Anne had been unable to expunge, she had no desire to revisit it. \nA sound came from across the room, and Anne flew back to Captain Wentworth\u2019s side. She watched him carefully as his head moved restlessly to and fro on the pillow, grateful for these returning signs of life,\u00a0then glanced over at the open door before retaking her seat. \nAnne caught her breath as his eyelids flickered, then slowly raised. His face bespoke confusion but then the corners of his mouth lifted. \n\u2018I did not dream it, then.\u2019 The captain\u2019s voice remained distant, and Anne retrieved the cordial bottle, doing her best to administer it, before he fell back against the pillows, his brow furrowed. \n\u2018What happened to me? My ship, the men.\u2019 Captain Wentworth sighed. \u2018I cannot recall, though I suspect the dear old Asp is gone to her watery grave.\u2019 \nUnready for this inquisition, Anne knew not how to respond. The Laconia was indeed sunk. The Asp was the sloop he had taken command of back in the year six, soon after their acrimonious parting. \n\u2018I know only what the papers reported and the little supplied by the naval emissary who brought you here from the port. At first, we thought all hands had been lost, and\u2014\u2019 \n\u2018We?\u2019 \nAnne drew in a short breath. \u2018My friend. Miss Bennet. She was here earlier when you first awoke.\u2019 \nThe captain did not speak, his eyes closing once more, and assuming he had drifted back into sleep, Anne remained quiet, but then his hand gripped the coverlet tightly. \n\u2018Tell me. I must know, however little.\u2019 \nDespite its hoarseness, Captain Wentworth\u2019s voice was as commanding as she recalled it, and Anne closed her own eyes briefly, simply relishing a sound she had long thought lost. \n\u2018Anne?\u2019 \n\u2018Your ship was caught in a monstrous storm off the coast of Ireland. I am so sorry, Frederick. I believe only a handful of men survived.\u2019 She lowered her head, imagining those terrifying moments as the freezing waves crashed over them all, as they fought with all their being for survival, thoughts of their loved ones most prevalent in their minds as life was brutally forced from their bodies. \nThere was silence for a moment, but then the captain drew a shuddering breath and his eyes opened. Though Anne did not wish him to know she could see his distress, the moisture on his lashes was sufficient to have her reach for her handkerchief, which she held out to him. \n\u2018Take this.\u2019 \nTurning his head on the pillow, the captain took the square of linen, a strange consciousness filling his face. \u2018You made me such an offering before. I kept it with me always as a token, but I fear it is now lost.\u2019 \nTears welled in Anne\u2019s eyes, and she dashed them away. She recalled the moment, in one of those happy days before they had parted. Was Frederick speaking the truth in that he had retained it? \nThe captain pressed the linen to his eyes, then held it to his nose. He tried to raise himself, but fell back against the pillows. \n\u2018I am ashamed to appear before you like this, dearest Anne.\u2019 He weakly indicated his state of undress. Then, his frown reappeared. \u2018How long have I lain thus?\u2019 \n\u2018You have been here in Somersetshire a mere four and twenty hours, but you were brought into Plymouth a few days ago.\u2019 \n\u2018I am so weary. My eyes persist in closing against my will.\u2019 Captain Wentworth\u2019s hand fell open upon the coverlet. \u2018Stay with me. Take my hand.\u2019 \nAnne reached out to take it, just as footsteps could be heard approaching, and Elizabeth entered the room with Mr Robinson. \n~o0o~ \nShepherd was once again at the desk when Darcy was shown into the study, his attention with the papers before him. \nSir Walter, who had been adjusting his cravat in the looking glass, greeted Darcy, then turned to his lawyer. \n\u2018You may leave us, Shepherd.\u2019 \n\u2018But Sir Walter, we must deal with the\u2026\u2019 The man flicked a wary glance in Darcy\u2019s direction. \u2018The Northamptonshire problem.\u2019 \nSir Walter waved a dismissive hand. \u2018We will deal with it later.\u2019 \nWith a displeased glare, Shepherd left the room, and Darcy wasted no time in informing Sir Walter of his daughter\u2019s intention of remaining at Meadowbrook House until she felt able to leave. He chose not to mention the captain\u2019s awakening, or Elizabeth\u2019s continuing in the neighbourhood. Besides, if the lady had her way, she would be homeward bound as soon as the horses could be harnessed on the morrow. \nDarcy pushed away his feelings on the subject. It was no time for such indulgence. \nSir Walter, in the meantime, was eyeing Darcy with displeasure, but then he brightened. \n\u2018Well, doubtless the man will soon be gone, and there will be an end to it. You will have heard I sent the Bennet girl onward? Anne\u2019s choosing to bring her here was most ill-judged.\u2019 He gestured towards the tray of spirits on the dresser. \u2018Shall we drink to the departure of those who are naught but an obstruction?\u2019 \nDarcy kept his tongue under good regulation, shaking his head as Sir Walter poured himself a large brandy. \n\u2018That is better.\u2019 He sipped at the brandy, waving Darcy into a chair and taking his own behind the desk. \u2018She was harmless enough, I will warrant, but Elizabeth took it into her head Miss Bennet was some sort of threat.\u2019 \nSir Walter laughed, and Darcy gripped his hands together, his ever-present anger towards the man and Miss Elliot stirring in his breast. \n\u2018Had some odd notion she was setting her bonnet at you.\u2019 Sir Walter continued, oblivious to Darcy\u2019s silence. \u2018Nonsensical. Ladies can be irrational in matters of the heart can they not? \u00a0I had no such fear, the lady\u2019s circumstances being so decidedly beneath your own. You would never deign to stoop so low.\u2019 He drained his glass. \u2018But my daughter would not have it. What we do for those we love, eh, Darcy?\u2019 \nDarcy stood up, almost choking on his words. \u2018That we can agree on, sir. I will do all in my power to protect those who are dear to me.\u2019 \n\u2018Capital. A father could not ask for finer sentiments.\u2019 Sir Walter rose from his seat and gestured towards the door. \u2018 Let us find Elizabeth.\u2019 \n\u2018You will have to excuse me, sir. I came merely to advise you of your daughter\u2019s wishes.\u2019 \n\u2018Nonsense, Darcy. A good turn deserves one in return. If I am to cause no fuss over Anne defying me and making a fool of herself in your house, then you will humour me. There is much to be decided.\u2019 \n~o0o~ \nCopyright\u00a0\u00a9\u00a02020 \u00a0Cass Grafton & Ada Bright \nThanks for reading along! The next chapter will be up on Saturday (23rd).",

Otherwise, expect chilly sunshine in the Piedmont with highs in the upper 40\u2019s. It stays mostly clear and quiet in Charlotte tonight with lows near freezing. \n\n\n\nSnow showers pick up in the mountains tonight into Monday. Cold air will rise quickly as winds run up the mountains. This will crank bursts of snow through Monday afternoon. An additional 1-2\u201d+ snow is possible in the highest elevations. Watch for slick spots and enjoy the fresh powder on the slopes. \n\n\n\nOtherwise, you\u2019ll find sunshine on Monday in Charlotte with highs near 50 degrees. \n\n\n\nA gradual warming trend starts Tuesday. Expect sunshine through the middle of the week with highs nearing 60 degrees by Wednesday and Thursday. \n\n\n\nOur next rain chance arrives Thursday into Friday.

                "title": "Getting Lost With Waterfalls",
                "text": "The day started with heavy, gusty rain.  The kind of rain that would be a nor\u2019easter had it been snow.  The kind of rain that makes you glad you\u2019re indoors looking out a window at it.  And paradoxically, the kind of rain I wanted to be outside fully alive in.  There\u2019s an edge to any storm, and this one was abating just enough to prompt me to pursue a micro adventure or two.  I packed up my rain gear and a water bottle and headed out to visit waterfalls. \n\n\n\nFirst stop was an hour from home, at Willard Brook State Park in Ashby, Massachusetts where the beautiful Trap Falls pour forever over granite ledge.  This is a popular spot in the warmer months, but on a rainy Saturday in January I was the only one there.  The falls were roaring from the rain, and easily heard from the small parking lot.  A brief, shuffling walk on a few slippery spots and I was quickly at the falls, and thought it might be a trick.  How could I have this all to myself on this day when the falls were screaming for attention?  The answer lies in that moment when I looked out the window and decided I ought to go out in this weather, while the rest of the world thought that would be a crazy idea.  Score one for the crazy folk. \n\n\n\nTrap Falls\n\n\n\nA few pictures and rock scrambles later, I headed back to the car and consulted the maps in Greg Parson\u2019s excellent resource New England Waterfalls, which I\u2019d picked up as a gift to myself while purchasing a gift for kindred spirits.  Parson\u2019s recommended a cluster of waterfalls just over the border in New Hampshire.  I looked at two in particular as promising and plugged in their coordinates in my Waze app and headed off for more adventure. \n\n\n\nDriving towards Milford, New Hampshire, I decided to focus on Lower Purgatory Falls as my first choice, and sought out the trailhead on Wilton Road.  The trailhead displayed some icy conditions and I brought my micro spikes with me for this hike.  I would soon be grateful for having them. \n\n\n\nThe walk from the road to the falls is roughly half a mile.  Nothing too crazy, really, just an old logging road that carries you to a yellow-blazed trail.  And like Trap Falls, you could hear Lower Purgatory Falls well before you got to them.  The falls are named for Purgatory Brook, a beautiful stretch of water that was white water after all the rain.  Cresting a small rise, I saw the falls ahead and worked my way down to see them.   \n\n\n\nAnd this is where the micro spikes were absolutely required.  I was hiking solo in isolated conservation land on a day when nobody else thought it logical to be out there.  A slip and fall would have been bad news.  Micro spikes remain one of the best hiking investments I\u2019ve ever made, and they offered a clear return on investment as I made my way down an ice covered hill with wet roots and rocks making up the better footing. \n\n\n\nLower Purgatory Falls is a triangle-shaped wonder set deep in the woods of the aptly named Purgatory Falls Conservation Area.  After the heavy rains and melt-off the falls had a lot to say, and I lingered by them for a bit to tap into their energy.  Again I wondered why I was the only fool out there on this day, but I\u2019m grateful I never came to my senses and stayed home. \n\n\n\nLower Purgatory Falls\n\n\n\nAs I was leaving the car I took a picture of the trail map supplied in Parson\u2019s book.  It indicated I could hike upstream to see Middle and Upper Purgatory Falls.  The trail seemed clearly blazed in yellow and tightly followed the brook.  And so I made my way upstream seeking more adventure.  I found it. \n\n\n\nHiking along the swollen brook, there were a couple of spots where it flooded over the trail, making for sketchy crossings.  Not plummet into a frozen brook sketchy, for I\u2019m not that crazy to attempt such things, more water deeper than your boot is tall sketchy.  I made a few calculated crossings, trail blazed in a couple of spots, but always stayed safe and kept the yellow blazes in sight. \n\n\n\nMossy Erratics\n\n\n\nPurgatory Brook, swollen with rainwater and melt-off\n\n\n\nEventually the trail dead-ended at a development with a port-o-potty announcing \u201cprogress\u201d.  I silently cursed the abrupt ending to the trail, looked around to see if I\u2019d missed it diverting elsewhere, and doubled back towards Lower Purgatory Falls, crossing anew the sketchy water crossings I\u2019d already attempted. \n\n\n\nAnd here\u2019s where it got interesting.  I returned to the spot where I\u2019d first seen the falls, looked left and right and saw yellow blazes going off in different directions.  WTF. \n\n\n\n\u201cMake sure to return on the trail you came in on as there are several official and unofficial paths in the area.  Look for the yellow blazes and the junctions you passed through on the way to the falls originally.\u201d \u2013 Greg Parsons and Kate Watson, New England Waterfalls \n\n\n\nWell, this is where I went wrong.  I took the wrong yellow-blazed trail towards what I thought was a return to my car.  After a few minutes of walking I was aware that I didn\u2019t recognize any part of this trail.  I doubled back and saw a logging road I\u2019d ignored before and started following it until it dead-ended.  Damn.  And this is where you make choices deep in the woods.  I could blaze my own trail through the woods with the compass on my cell phone, a picture from a book and Google maps as my guide, or I could double back once again and find the right trail.  I\u2019ve learned to trust my instincts in such situations, and not trust a phone battery.  I doubled back. \n\n\n\nFinding a junction in the trail, I saw the yellow blazes once again splitting off in two directions.  Who the hell blazed this land??  I stuck with the more worn trail and followed it to a place where (surprise!) I\u2019d been before.  It seems I\u2019d followed the yellow blazed loop back around onto itself.  And this is why bringing a compass and a reliable waterproof map is essential.  Having neither, I relied on my experience in similar situations and kept my head about me.  Since I was back on a trail I recognized, I simply followed it back to the Lower Purgatory Falls.  Once there I saw immediately where I\u2019d gone wrong and followed the correct yellow-blazed trail back to the logging road and eventually to the trailhead.  Phew! \n\n\n\nThis adventure started off as seeking a few waterfalls on a wet day.  It became a small test in orienteering in unfamiliar woods on a wet, disorienting day without the proper equipment.  And it ended with me deciding that two waterfalls were enough for one day.  I thanked my wits and good fortune and headed home.  The other waterfalls will have to wait\u2026  for now. \nThe post Getting Lost With Waterfalls appeared first on Alexandersmap.",

                "text": "Chapter 10: Awakening\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nAt first, he drifted in and out of sleep. There was plenty of wood and he reasoned it would stay lit for at least several hours. When it died down, the cold would awaken him and he would add to the wood.\u00a0 \n\n\n\nThe dreams carried him here and there. \n\n\n\nHe was back in Ireland, before the war, back to a time when he and Sean still acted as family. It was spring and the leaves were finally growing on the trees, providing shelter from the rain that fell onto the busy streets. Together, they travelled to the university, \u201cWe\u2019re both almost finished,\u201d said Martin. \u201cSoon we will have the good jobs we have worked so hard to deserve.\u201d \n\n\n\nAfter class they played hurley on the field just in back. And there was always the rowing. Day by day they rowed the Liffey, one oar each, their backs straining. There was always the next big race, but each one knew he could depend on the other, no matter what. \n\n\n\n\u201cAs a solicitor there is a lot I could do,\u201d said Sean. \u201cMaybe I will run for office. There\u2019s a lot I would change, given the chance.\u201d\u00a0 \n\n\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not for me,\u201d said Martin. \u201cI want to write.\u201d \n\n\n\n\u201cAbout what?\u201d \n\n\n\n\u201cOh, about life. All of it!\u201d replied Martin, quaffing the last of his pint.\u00a0 \n\n\n\nSometimes they even took the stage and, together, sang the songs they\u2019d learned from their parents.\u00a0 \n\n\n\n\u201cNot those old war songs though,\u201d their parents kept insisting. \u201cIt\u2019s time for us all to come together, not to fight amongst ourselves.\u201d \n\n\n\nBut they sang them anyway. They were young. What odds! \n\n\n\nIt became hot. A fire appeared between them. Where did that come from? Neither of them had lit it. As it grew larger and larger, each began blaming the other for starting it. Their voices grew to a shout as the flames grew higher and higher. Finally, neither could see the other anymore through the smoke and fire. Still they kept shouting across the ever-growing maelstrom, the noise getting so loud that neither was capable of hearing the other. Not anymore. \n\n\n\n\u201cMartin!\u201d \n\n\n\nThe flames disappeared and he was on board a liner. The waters were choppy and the vessel pitched and rolled as each passing wave threaten to toss all on board into the cold, unforgiving ocean.\u00a0 \n\n\n\n\u201cWhy did you do that?\u201d came the voices of his parents, over and over. \n\n\n\nMartin tried to stand, to face the stern of the boat and to call out to them, no doubt standing arm in arm on the wharf. He couldn\u2019t. He was held back by the force of some unseen hand. He tried to break free, turning this way and that, but it was no use. That which held him was much more powerful than he. \n\n\n\nHe gave up and let the engine, the wind, and the waves just carry him along. \n\n\n\nAnd carry him they did; across the channel, along the rails and through the fields of France, to the trenches, to where he\u2019d met Vince. \n\n\n\n\u201cMartin!\u201d \n\n\n\nIt was Vince. He was standing at Mr. Deasy\u2019s wharf and beckoning for him to come and join him. Martin ran to him and embraced him, crying, \u201cI\u2019m so very sorry.\u201d \n\n\n\nBut Vince just smiled, \u201cDon\u2019t be. I made my choices. Now you have to make yours.\u201d \n\n\n\n\u201cJoin me,\u201d he said and together they rowed over to the flat Island, laced up their skates and stepped out onto the pond.\u00a0 \n\n\n\n\u201cLet me show you how to stop, first,\u201d said Vince, turning his skates sideways, shifting his weight backwards and shooting up a cloud of snow before him. \u201cJust like this! It\u2019s easy. \u00a0You just have to know when it\u2019s time.\u201d \n\n\n\nThey each took a hockey stick and Vince dropped a puck on the ice. Together they played a game of one-on-one.\u00a0 \n\n\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve come a long way,\u201d said Vince, as Martin skated effortlessly around the pond, stickhandling like a pro, then came to a sudden stop in front of the net before shooting the puck right through Vince\u2019s legs. \n\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve had a lot of help,\u201d laughed Martin. \n\n\n\n\u201cWell then, I guess it\u2019s time for me to go then,\u201d said Vince, jumping into the dory and rowing away, over the ice and flying just above the trees beyond. \n\n\n\n\u201cWait,\u201d shouted Martin, \u201cWhat were the last two verses of the song you used to sing back in France?\u201d \n\n\n\nOver the cry of the wind boomed Vince\u2019s powerful voice as he sang the words that Martin immediately recognized from so many years before, \u201cYou can take Fritzy\u2019s guns and bombs and shove them all\u2026\u201d \n\n\n\n\u201cNo, not that one, the other one?\u201d \n\n\n\n\u201cWhat other one?\u201d \n\n\n\n\u201cThe one you sang on the night before\u2026before\u2026\u201d \n\n\n\n\u201cBefore I died? Oh, I\u2019m surprised you remember that one because I only sung it that one time. It went like this:\u201d \n\n\n\nAnd over the wind, Vince\u2019s voice boomed: \n\n\n\nUntil that happens I\u2019ll be keeping up my end but I\u2019m not in this alone. I\u2019m surrounded by this motley bunch that I call friends, the finest crew I\u2019ve known. \n\n\n\nAs for what is there before you, nobody knows just what\u2019s in store. But if you work in concert with this fine crew we\u2019ll see vic-to-ry for sure. \n\n\n\n\u201cMartin!\u201d \n\n\n\nIt was Anna. They were at the hall and she was looking at him with concern. Everyone was there, and all were, it seemed at first, looking at him. No, they were looking at someone else, too. \n\n\n\n\u201cWhat shall we do with them?\u201d the voices were all saying. \n\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll be alright,\u201d he replied. \u201cI have lots of help.\u201d \n\n\n\nHe stood up, walked out the door and entered his office back in Dublin. The war was not yet over but his fighting days were. \u201cYour lungs are scarred for life,\u201d the doctors had told him, \u201cYou\u2019re lucky to be alive at all. You are not going back to the front. Not ever. Here, mind this desk.\u201d \n\n\n\nMartin did as he was ordered. He crouched by the desk, hand on the trigger of the Vickers, and waited for the enemy.\u00a0 \n\n\n\nThey never came. Only shadows\u2014friend or foe, he was never sure but he stayed at the ready. It was his duty now. \n\n\n\nThen the war ended. \u201cThe desk is fine now,\u201d they told him, \u201cOff you go. On your way.\u201d \n\n\n\nMartin drifted from place to place, spending a little time at each, and always guarding the desk. But the money and the promotions never came, and the desks never changed. \n\n\n\nHe waved goodbye to his parents as they sailed away forever. They did not want to go but they too were in the grip of a force much greater than they were. Sean was there as well but the fire still burned between them and the voices still could not carry over it. \n\n\n\n\u201cMartin!\u201d \n\n\n\nRichard called to him from the forest and Martin helped him carry out the firewood wood. \u201cYou\u2019re doing a lot better now than when you came, still you still have a lot to learn,\u201d he said, watching Martin try to fillet the fish he\u2019d just caught. \u201cPerhaps next year you\u2019ll even be fit to take hunting,\u201d he added, laughing. \n\n\n\n\u201cYes, but first we\u2019ll do a bit of reading together,\u201d he replied, holding up a book he\u2019d brought along. \n\n\n\n\u201cWe\u2019d all like it if you\u2019d show us to read as well,\u201d said the voices from just downstairs as, one by one, they came to visit. \u201cHow\u2019s he doing?\u201d they chanted before leaving. \n\n\n\nAnd in the silence they left behind Martin rowed slowly around and around the harbour.\u00a0 \n\n\n\nSometimes the sun would be out, warming his heart, lightening the weight of the oars. Other times wind and rain stirred the water, dampening his spirits. From time to time he rowed by the light of the moon, its pale glow, barely hiding the ghosts of those he\u2019d lost, observing from just beyond the meadows and gardens that lined the edges of this little haven of humanity; this sacred space that all seemed so bent on hanging on to.\u00a0 \n\n\n\nThe light faded and then there was complete darkness. He rowed blind, guided only by the ripple of the tide and the sound of the boats squeaking against their wharves. \n\n\n\n\u201cMartin!\u201d \n\n\n\nHe stopped rowing, feeling his heart race. Where was that voice coming from? He could not make out anyone in the darkness. \n\n\n\n\u201cMartin!\u201d the voice called again. It was Ellen. \n\n\n\nThe dory vanished. He was warm and comfortable, in bed. He opened his eyes to find Ellen sitting in a rocking chair just at the foot of the bed. He looked around. All four walls were papered with white flowers, with green leaves and gold-coloured stems, all set on a black background.\u00a0 \n\n\n\nWhere had he seen that paper before? The sight of it calmed him, reminding him of when he had arrived and, for the first time in so many years, felt hope and a sense of belonging. He was not at home but this place was so familiar. He racked his brain trying to recall where he had seen it before. Then it dawned on him. He was in Pat\u2019s room. \n\n\n\nHe tried to stir but found it difficult, even painful. \n\n\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t move too fast,\u201d Ellen said, \u201cYou\u2019ve been laid up for a long time.\u201d \n\n\n\n\u00a0\u201cWhat am I doing here?\u201d he asked. \n\n\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t you remember?\u201d \n\n\n\n\u201cRemember what?\u201d \n\n\n\n\u201cYou almost died.\u201d \n\n\n\nMartin tried to recall how he got there. The flat island. The dory. Something about skating, perhaps? Yes, that was it. The snow squall. \u201cThe last thing I remember was lighting a fire and waiting for daylight.\u201d \n\n\n\n\u201cWe brought you to our house shortly after we found you. You\u2019ve been here ever since. You\u2019ve mostly been asleep but every now and then you\u2019d wake up and we\u2019d get a bit of food in you but the talk and such you were getting on with made no sense. And that cough. It was awful.\u201d \n\n\n\n\u201cI had my all lungs scarred up in the war. I was gassed.\u201d \n\n\n\n\u201cI figured something was up with all that hacking and barking you\u2019d do from time to time,\u201d she said, \u201cbut I didn\u2019t want to ask. You didn\u2019t seem to want to talk much about your past.\u201d \n\n\n\n\u201cThe past is gone,\u201d escaped his lips, involuntarily, as if he\u2019d been rehearsing it the past few weeks. \u201cHow long have I been here?\u201d \n\n\n\nEllen hesitated before answering, \u201cThree weeks.\u201d \n\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll get Richard,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ll be right back. Don\u2019t try to get up.\u201d \n\n\n\nShe padded downstairs and Martin heard the door opening and closing. Get up? Martin doubted he could. He could barely move. He was sore all over and strangely tired. Just what had happened, and why was he here? \n\n\n\nThe door opened and soon Martin heard several voices talking downstairs. Shortly afterward, Richard and Ellen came into his room. Ellen resumed her place in the rocking chair, and Richard sat at the end of the bed. \n\n\n\n\u201cHow did I get here?\u201d Martin asked. \n\n\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t you recall what happened?\u201d asked Richard. \n\n\n\n\u201cSome of it. There was a sudden storm. We barely made it back to the flat island. I made a shelter and lit a fire. That\u2019s all.\u201d \n\n\n\n\u201cWe became worried when Pat didn\u2019t get back before dark,\u201d Ellen said, \u201cNot that it was completely unusual as sometimes it happens. But when it was time for the concert, and she still wasn\u2019t here we knew something was up. We went over to the hall to see if she\u2019d gone directly there but found out she hadn\u2019t. Some of the people said that she\u2019d gone fishing after skating with them, so we became concerned for her safety.\u201d \n\n\n\nNobody missed me, Martin thought. I really do need to be less of a loner around here. \n\n\n\nEllen continued, \u201cWe organized a search party but it wasn\u2019t very hard to find you. The first thing we came across was the motor boat, empty and adrift. It was out of fuel. From there we could see a huge fire lighting up the sky over the flat Island so we all went there right away. When we arrived we found the two of you in a shelter, both of you near death.\u201d \n\n\n\n\u201cGood thing we arrived when we did,\u201d Richard interjected, \u201cThe fire had caught to your load of wood. What a bonfire you had going! It would have likely burned the whole island if we\u2019d not been there to put it out.\u201d \n\n\n\n\u201cYes, but without the fire we might not have found you in time,\u201d said Ellen. \u201cWe put you both in a motor boat and went first to the hall, because we knew it was warm there. After that, we brought you back here and you\u2019ve been here in the bed ever since\u201d \n\n\n\n\u201cPat?\u201d Martin asked. \n\n\n\nEllen looked at Richard. Both looked down.\u00a0 \n\n\n\nIn the silence, Martin\u2019s heart began racing. \n\n\n\nEllen started slowly, \u201cPat\u2019s gone\u2026\u201d \n\n\n\nMartin closed his eyes, \u201cAnother lost friend,\u201d was all he could think. \n\n\n\nEllen continued, \u201cShe left for Ansauvage to continue her schooling. With you here sick in bed for the past three weeks there\u2019s been nobody to take your place. We were going to put you in one of the spare bedrooms but Pat insisted you stay here because this room is warmer. With all that coughing and hacking you\u2019ve been doing we weren\u2019t sure you\u2019d ever some out of it.\u201d \n\n\n\nA wave of relief spread over Martin. \n\n\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s enough for now,\u201d said Ellen. \u201cLet me get you some soup.\u201d \n\n\n\nShe went downstairs and, shortly after, reappeared with a small bowl. Martin sat up in the bed and drank it. He put it down on the chair next to the bed. \u201cGot any tea?\u201d he asked. \n\n\n\nRichard smiled, \u201cTea? You must be coming around. Let me get it. Extra lassy today.\u201d \n\n\n\nHe came back up with the cup and Martin sipped away at it. \n\n\n\nWhen he was done Ellen said, \u201cNow go rest a bit more. Let\u2019s see if we can get you up out of bed tomorrow.\u201d \n\n\n\nThe next morning, when Martin awoke, he felt much stronger. He washed up, dressed using the clothes that had been left out for him, and went downstairs. \u201cMm, toutons! I haven\u2019t had them since you made them way back in August.\u201d \n\n\n\n\u201cI made them just for you.\u201d replied Ellen. \u201cYou have to get your strength back.\u201d \n\n\n\nMartin took up several and sat at the table. \u201cThese just might be my favourite food. If I could have them every morning before school I\u2019d probably be a better teacher.\u201d \n\n\n\nHe turned to Ellen, \u201cWhat day is it? Should I be at school?\u201d \n\n\n\nShe laughed, \u201cIt\u2019s January the ninth and it\u2019s a Saturday so, no, you don\u2019t have to be in school today.\u201d \n\n\n\n\u201cAnd neither do I,\u201d she added. \n\n\n\nMartin looked at her quizzically? \u201cYou? At school?\u201d \n\n\n\n\u201cYes, I\u2019m your new colleague. I just started full time last Monday. And I might say it was pretty quiet with nobody in the next room. I will be happy when you are strong enough come back.\u201d \n\n\n\n\u201cThen Anna\u2026\u201d \n\n\n\n\u201c\u2026is leaving for town tomorrow,\u201d Ellen finished. \n\n\n\n\u201cSo she\u2019s taking the job?\u201d \n\n\n\n\u201cYes, as far as I am concerned there was never any doubt,\u201d said Ellen. \u201cThat new position is just perfect for her and she\u2019s paid her dues here to this community. It\u2019s time for Anna to cross over and see what\u2019s next for her.\u201d \n\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just that I\u2026\u201d began Martin. \n\n\n\n\u201cOh you don\u2019t have to explain it to me. I know how it is between the two of you. She\u2019s brought you to the point where you\u2019re now an excellent teacher for our students and you, in turn, helped her to find the strength and courage to do what she must.\u201d \n\n\n\nMartin nodded, \u201cBut I\u2019ll still miss her. I have to say goodbye before she leaves.\u201d \n\n\n\n\u201cWell you missed your chance to do it in style,\u201d Ellen responded. \n\n\n\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d \n\n\n\n\u201cJust last night we had a farewell party for her up at the hall. Almost everyone from the community was there and we all had a grand time. It pretty much made up for the concert you and Pat went and ruined on us just before Christmas!\u201d she said, smiling all the while. \n\n\n\n\u201cI bet it was the only time she ever attended here that she didn\u2019t organize herself!\u201d said Martin. \u201cI suppose the rest of us will have to step up now.\u201d \n\n\n\n\u201cThat we will!\u201d Ellen assured him. \u201cShe\u2019s taught us all well.\u201d \n\n\n\n\u201cI think I will head over and check on my place,\u201d said Martin. \n\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s in good shape. Richard\u2019s been looking in on it like he always did.\u201d \n\n\n\nMartin went to the closet and found his long rubbers. He looked up on the shelf and found his woolen cap, mittens and socks placed there in a box. He looked out through the window and saw the snow on the ground, \u201cI imagine I\u2019ll really need these now,\u201d he said. \n\n\n\n\u201cYou should probably take your time walking over there today,\u201d said Ellen, \u201cYou still don\u2019t know how much strength you have.\u201d \n\n\n\n\u201cThe dory, is it okay?\u201d \n\n\n\n\u201cYes, it was just about filled with water when we found it. We still don\u2019t know how you had the strength to row it to the island like that. We went back a few days later, bailed it out and towed it back. We also found a pair of skates in a box in the shelter. They\u2019re over in the house.\u201d \n\n\n\nMartin felt relieved. He did not want to lose the skates. Not those ones. \n\n\n\n\u201cWe hauled the dory up on to your wharf, too, because we didn\u2019t know how long you would be like that,\u201d Ellen said, pointing upstairs. \u201cRichard can help you launch it again when you\u2019re ready.\u201d \n\n\n\n\u201cThanks!\u201d said Martin. \u201cThanks for everything. You and Richard are such wonderful friends.\u201d \n\n\n\n\u201cOur pleasure,\u201d said Ellen, getting ready to close the door. She suddenly stopped, turned around and went to the kitchen. \u201cWait, I have some mail for you.\u201d She returned with two letters and placed them in Martin\u2019s hand. \n\n\n\n\u201cThanks, again.\u201d \n\n\n\nMartin slowly walked back to his house. When he arrived he was pleased to find a huge pile of firewood, all cut up and neatly stacked on the woodpile next to his house. It was much more than he had cut. \n\n\n\nNot that my bonfire likely left much of that, he laughed to himself. Still he felt grateful to whomever had placed it there. \n\n\n\nHe went inside and found still more wood stacked up in the box next to the stove. He soon had a fire going. \n\n\n\nHe was tired out. I am finally grateful for the daybed, he thought as he laid back and let the fire warm him up. He had a mind to get out a book but found it more interesting to, instead, just look out the window at the harbour and watch the comings and goings of the livyers as they went about their ordinary Saturday routines. \n\n\n\nFunny, he thought, I\u2019d never really taken much notice before, but now it was all so interesting. He looked. The children, sledding on the hill beside the school. The older ones, heading out in the boats, no doubt to do some skating or maybe even play some hockey, over on the flat island. The adults heading out, then coming back, the boats laden with fish or wood. The people simply walking back and forth and giving a nod upon seeing Martin peering out the window. \n\n\n\nTime passed. The shadows lengthened until, finally, the sun went down behind the Tolt. \n\n\n\nI guess I\u2019ll soon have to get up and cook something, Martin thought. But what? After three weeks, he realized he had no idea of what was left in the cupboard. Besides, the thought of having to go the bother of actually cooking something did not exactly excite him. It was all he could do to get up, every so often, and replenish the wood in the fire. \n\n\n\n\u201cIt would be nice if Ellen would drop by with a few more toutons,\u201d he mused. \n\n\n\nA movement down by his wharf caught his eye. A motorboat had crossed the harbour and was now tying up to his wharf. He sat up higher on the daybed and strained his eyes to see what it was. Nobody but him ever used the wharf! Who could it be? It was low tide, though, and he simply could not see. \n\n\n\nMrs. Deasy? \n\n\n\nAnd Mr. Deasy. \n\n\n\nAnd Anna! \n\n\n\nThe three of them were coming up the path to his house. Martin got up as quickly as he dared and, in a sudden panic, looked around the soon to see how presentable the place was. All good. He resolved to thank Richard and Ellen later for that. \n\n\n\nA knock. Of course. It was, after all, Anna. He opened the door. \n\n\n\n\u201cWe heard you were up and around and wanted to pay you a visit,\u201d she said. \n\n\n\n\u201cPlease, come in!\u201d \n\n\n\n\u201cLovely heat you\u2019ve got on here,\u201d said Anna, \u201clooks like you don\u2019t restrict the bonfires to the flat island.\u201d \n\n\n\n\u201cI try.\u201d \n\n\n\n\u201cWe brought our welcome,\u201d said Mrs. Deasy. \u201cWould you care for some supper?\u201d \n\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m famished!\u201d Martin hadn\u2019t realized how quickly the time had passed. \n\n\n\nMrs. Deasy spread out the food. Roast duck, boiled salt beef, bread pudding, vegetables and a pot of gravy, which she warmed on the stove. Martin pulled out the table from the wall and fetched two extra chairs from the bedroom. Mr. Deasy lit the lamp and they all sat down together. \n\n\n\n\u201cThis is the first time I\u2019ve had anyone over for supper,\u201d Martin offered. \n\n\n\n\u201cWell, hopefully it won\u2019t be the last,\u201d replied Mrs. Deasy, and we hope you won\u2019t be shy in joining us over at our place from time to time. Maybe we could even make a regular thing of it now that\u2026\u201d \n\n\n\n\u201c\u2026Now that I won\u2019t be around for you to tend on anymore,\u201d Anna laughed. \n\n\n\n\u201cMartin, you had us all very worried,\u201d said Mr. Deasy. \u201cWe were afraid we were going to lose you. And especially now that I\u2019d finally gotten used to having you hanging around the shop every Saturday. \n\n\n\n\u201cYes, the whole community came together to try and help out. At least to do the few things that Richard and Ellen would let us do. Those two! They seem to have a real soft spot for you,\u201d said Anna. \u201cThey all helped with the wood, and you\u2019ll find your cupboard very well stocked. Don\u2019t be surprised if you get a few more visits like this one, too. There are a lot of people who would really like to get to know you and this is a nice way to do it, wouldn\u2019t you say?\u201d \n\n\n\nThey sat and ate; most of the talk during supper was of the day-to-day variety. After supper, Anna insisted on washing the dishes. She filled the pan with hot water from the kettle and went to work while the others lingered at the table. \n\n\n\n\u201cSo you\u2019re leaving tomorrow,\u201d Martin said to Anna. \n\n\n\n\u201cYes, they said I could start at any time and just into the new year seemed to be a good time to make the change.\u201d \n\n\n\n\u201cBut why didn\u2019t you leave last week when the Christmas break was over?\u201d \n\n\n\nAnna stopped what she was doing, put the cloth down by her side and turned to face Martin, \u201cBecause I\u2026\u201d\u00a0 \n\n\n\nShe stopped and looked down. She stood in silence for a few seconds, then lifted her head and tried again, \u201cBecause I just could not bear the thought of losing you and being so far away from you if you, if you\u2026\u201d\u00a0 \n\n\n\nShe trailed off and started again, \u201cLook, nine years ago, my brother died, alone, all the way over in France and I was not there to be with him when he needed me most. I was not prepared to lose you that same way. Since he\u2019s been gone you\u2019re the closest thing to a brother I have had. \u2026ever will have.\u201d \n\n\n\nHer shoulders drooped. Martin could see she was fighting back tears. It got quiet. \n\n\n\n\u201cVince didn\u2019t die alone,\u201d Martin\u2019s gentle voice broke the silence. \u201cI was there.\u201d \n\n\n\nAnna went white. She wavered and steadied herself against the wash stand. It looked like she was about to fall, but she just dropped the cloth and made her way over to the table and sat back in the chair. \u201cWhat did you just say?\u201d \n\n\n\nMartin took a deep breath and then let it all out. He started by telling of how he\u2019d met Vince, just after training. He went on to tell her of how they\u2019d grown as friends as they served together and how Vince had almost single-handedly maintained the morale of the entire platoon through his stories and songs of life back home. He went on to tell them of the skilful, effective sergeant he\u2019d become and of how he\u2019d served with bravery and honour. \n\n\n\nMartin finished with, \u201cVince died right by my side. I had his head in my lap the whole time. In all honesty I can tell you that his friendship was the one good thing that happened to me during the war.\u201d \n\n\n\nThey all sat in silence for a while.\u00a0 \n\n\n\nFinally Anna, who had been looking straight ahead, out the window, tilted her head to look at Martin, \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you say something earlier?\u201d \n\n\n\n\u201cI wanted to. Lots of times. It never seemed to be the right time to bring it up and, as time went on, it just became harder and harder.\u201d \n\n\n\n\u201cAnd it took my moving away to get it out of you. We would never have known.\u201d \n\n\n\nMartin hung his head. He had no further words. He wanted to be away. In the boat. On the island. Even up in his empty classroom. Anywhere but right here, right now. \n\n\n\nMr. Deasy cleared his throat the way he did when he wanted everyone to listen. He reached inside the breast pocket of his coat and retrieved a battered envelope. From it he withdrew several sheets of letterhead that Martin recognized. He spread the sheets out on the table and pointed to the last line of the last sheet. \u201cThis is you.\u201d \n\n\n\nMartin looked where he was pointing. It was his signature. It was the letter he\u2019d written to Vince\u2019s parents, who he now knew as Mr. and Mrs. Deasy. \n\n\n\n\u201cYes, I wrote that letter. It was my first one and it was probably the hardest thing I ever did.\u201d He stopped, almost choking on his words. \u201cVince was my friend. My only friend.\u201d \n\n\n\n\u201cI figured it out shortly after you arrived. You see, you were not the only one who wrote home. I kept all the letters. He considered you his best friend too.\u201d \n\n\n\nAnna looked at her father with a mixture of anger and hurt. Everyone heard the question. She didn\u2019t need to ask it out loud. \n\n\n\n\u201cBecause everything happens in its own time,\u201d was all he said. \n\n\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s time to head home for the night,\u201d said Mrs. Deasy. Looking at Anna she continued, \u201cYou have a big day tomorrow and need to get some rest.\u201d \n\n\n\nThey all got up to leave. \u201cThank you for everything,\u201d Martin offered, as they left the step and turned to walk down the path. \n\n\n\nAll three turned to look at Martin. Anna spoke for them all, \u201cNo, thank you, Martin. For everything.\u201d \n\n\n\nMartin went back inside, and turned down the light in the lamp. He watched the boat cross the harbour. He observed as all three got out at Mr. Deasy\u2019s wharf and walked to their house. He kept looking out at the harbour for a long time afterward. \n\n\n\nThe fire died down, but before Martin went to bed he wrote in his journal. \n\n\n\nJan. 7: Awoke today after a long sleep. Despite my recent illness, I confess to feeling more alive than I have in a very long time.",

                "text": "On Friday, we had a blizzard. This week, it\u2019s supposed to be in the 50s. I suppose it could be worse, weather-wise. We\u2019ve had weeks (usually in March or May) where we got a foot of snow one day, and had 90\u00b0F highs a week later. Nebraska weather is fun.  \n\n\n\nIs anyone else anticipating Biden\u2019s inauguration with both breathless anticipation and a sense of nervous dread? I am amazed that I haven\u2019t already drunk the last third of that bottle of bourbon I bought at the beginning of December.  \n\n\n\nObligatory Mina Photo: \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDon\u2019t be fooled by this picture of sweetness and peace. This cute little black cat is an absolute menace at night, waking me up in the darkest hours by trying to open kitchen cabinets or knocking things off shelves or jumping onto the nightstand with such exuberance that she knocks it against the wall causing a loud bang five inches from my face.  \n\n\n\nThe next day, she will curl up on the back on the couch and sleep while I am doing the quiet things of the evening and give me dirty looks if I manage to wake her up. I say that turnabout is fair play. She disagrees. \n\n\n\nIt\u2019s a good thing she\u2019s cute. \n\n\n\nWhat I Finished Reading Last Week: \n\n\n\nParadise Lost by John MiltonAll Systems Red (The Murderbot Diaries #1) by Martha Wells, audiobook narrated by Kevin R. FreeArtificial Condition (The Murderbot Diaries #2) by Martha Wells, audiobook narrated by Kevin R. FreeRogue Protocol (The Murderbot Diaries #3) by Martha Wells, audiobook narrated by Kevin R. FreeThe Searcher by Tana FrenchFoundation (The Collegium Chronicles #1) by Mercedes Lackey\n\n\n\nParadise Lost is now a book that I have read. Finally. My thoughts on it? Some beautiful poetry, Satanic monologues (literally, given that it\u2019s Satan speaking), and a healthy dose of \u201cHey, let\u2019s summarize multiple books of the Bible\u201d (which reminds me of the end of The Silmarillion, in which Tolkien summarizes the entire story of The Lord of the Rings in about a page). All things considered, if I have to pick a piece of Biblical fanfiction, I think I\u2019ll stick with  Dante\u2019s The Divine Comedy.  \n\n\n\nMurderbot! I love Murderbot. It\u2019s particular brand of disinterest, introversion, self-consciousness, and the emotional states Murderbot deals with on a regular basis are so compelling to me. And it\u2019s always a breath of fresh air when Murderbot or any of the other bots don\u2019t have it in for the humans, as so many stories dealing with AI seem to have willfully murderous AI characters. That does get old after a while. But the bots in Wells\u2019s universe aren\u2019t angry killers of humans (not without a good reason, anyway). Because they know that they have a symbiotic relationship with the humans who do things like create the media and the regeneration pods that put broken bots back together. I\u2019m looking forward to the fourth novella in the series, but it\u2019ll be a bit before I get to that.  \n\n\n\nThe Searcher by Tana French is about a Cal, an ex-Chicago cop who moves to a tiny town in western Ireland to get away from the city and the crime he spent his life investigating. At first, the slow pace of life and open spaces are exactly what he wants, but before too long he discovers that small town life has its own complications, as feuds can go back decades and everyone knows everything about what you\u2019re doing. Cal\u2019s problems are compounded when a local kid, Trey, from an ill-favored family asks for help in locating an older brother, Brendan, who everyone thinks has run off to Dublin. Trey isn\u2019t so sure and will stop at nothing to find out what happened to Brendan, including dragging Cal into the middle of feuds and politics that Cal doesn\u2019t understand and might not survive. I loved every page of this book. It unfurls slowly with French\u2019s signature, gorgeous prose. Her descriptions of the landscape and the rain reminded me of being in Ireland, Iceland, and my grandmother\u2019s tiny farm in the hills of the Kansas/Nebraska border. I don\u2019t know how she does it, but French captures the complexities of small town life and doesn\u2019t make it all sentimental and schmaltzy. It makes me want to go back and re-read her Dublin Murder Squad series. \n\n\n\nI read Foundation by Mercedes Lackey for for the Valdemar Readalong I\u2019m participating in along with Jackie at Death by Tsundoku and Mel at Grab the Lapels. It\u2019s about a young teenager, Mags, who has essentially been a slave at a mine until he is rescued by his Companion, a magical horse named Dallen. Thanks to his magical talents and good heart, he is swept off to the capitol of the kingdom, Haven, where he learns how to be a Herald, makes new friends, and has his talents recognized by some very important people. Mags is a pretty typical Lackey-ian character (she does love the Mystic Waif trope), but unlike others, Mags is not a young emo going about feeling sorry for himself. He feels pretty great about getting his own room, tasty food whenever he wants it, and a BFF in Dallen. It\u2019s a quick read but\u2026. nothing really happens. There\u2019s very little plot and it feels entirely like set-up for the rest of the series. You follow Mags around while he\u2019s doing day to day stuff, meeting people, and observing some shady goings-on which are hardly followed up on. There\u2019s a big event at the very end which pops up out of nowhere and it dealt with a page or two later. But I like Mags, and I want to continue with the series, because Lackey\u2019s books are like cotton candy\u2013 quick to get through and enjoyable, even if there\u2019s very little substance. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat I\u2019m Currently Reading: \n\n\n\nA Promised Land by Barack Obama, narrated by the author (20%)Breath: The New Science of a Lost Art by James Nestor (11%)Oathbringer (The Stormlight Archive #3) by Brandon Sanderson (42/1248)\n\n\n\nI started exactly one of the books I intended to read last weekend. It\u2019s the library\u2019s fault. You see, it had been several weeks since I\u2019d been to the library, and it knew. Not the librarians. The building itself knew I hadn\u2019t been there for a long time, so it conspired and moved all these fascinating novellas into the perfect place to get my attention, and then\u2013 and then!\u2013 it made half of my digital holds come available within two days of each other! I had to delay checking out part of what came available, but you can bet I downloaded A Promised Land when the Libby app\u2019s notification popped up. Because, you know, the politics of the past four years. It\u2019s been such a nostalgic experience, even though I\u2019m only 20% of the way through. Obama takes the reader through his early life, falling in love with Michelle, and how he got started in politics. And then came the keynote address at the Democratic National Convention in 2004, when he delivered one of the great speeches of his life so far and rocketed to political stardom. Then his senate campaign and his first presidential run. I remember so much about that campaign. I remembered watching his \u2018Yes We Can\u2019 speech after the New Hampshire primary, and it brought tears to me eyes. It feels like it was a lifetime ago. But listening to Obama talk about his failures right along with his achievements has been a balm to my mind after\u2026 well, after the whole slog of 2017 until now. \n\n\n\nBreath: The New Science of a Lost Art was another digital library hold that showed up unexpectedly. It\u2019s about the science of breathing, which is a nascent science because we\u2019ve taken breathing for granted. But ancient writings detail the importance of good breathing practices, and modern science is just beginning to investigate how breathing affects things like respiratory health, cranio-facial development, snoring, stress hormones, blood pressure, and anxiety. I\u2019m 11% of the way in, and Nestor is talking about how he participated in a breathing study where he was forced to breathe through his mouth for ten days. Halfway in, he is miserable. While I do find some of the claims Nestor makes about the power of good breathing a little dubious, I\u2019m willing to look at his evidence. It certainly can\u2019t hurt, and if improving my own breathing can make me feel even a little better on a day to day basis, I\u2019m good with that. \n\n\n\nOathbringer has been on my shelf for the past couple of years, ever since I found a hardback copy at the used bookstore. I haven\u2019t read any of the Stormlight Archive books since 2015, but I\u2019m not going to go back and reread the first two books to get caught back up. Who has time for that? I remember enough to get by, and in the first forty pages, enough has come back that I\u2019m not feeling at all lost. But I\u2019m forty-three pages into a gigantic book, so we\u2019ll see if that changes. I\u2019m not super invested in Sanderson\u2019s books, but the people on the Shelf Space Bookclub\u2019s Discord server are so enthusiastic about the Stormlight Archive that it\u2019s hard to resist picking it up again. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat I Plan to Start Reading This Week: \n\n\n\nThe Daughters of Ys by M.T. Anderson and Jo RiouxBurning Roses by S.L. HuangThe Book of Lost Tales, Pt. 1 (The History of Middle-earth #1) by J.R.R. Tolkien, edited by Christopher Tolkien\n\n\n\nI still want to read The Daughters of Ys and Burning Roses. I just didn\u2019t get to them. See the non-renewable digital checkouts above. But I can renew my checkouts on these two, so I\u2019m set.  \n\n\n\nI need to get started on The History of Middle-earth books, as my plan was to read the first two parts (The Book of Lost Tales, Pt. 1 and The Book of Lost Tales, Pt. 2) this month. Fortunately, they\u2019re not long, so it shouldn\u2019t be a problem. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Craft: \n\n\n\nI started working on the blanket I bought all the fluffy yarn for. So far, I\u2019m loving the color combination, but there is a problem. The yarn. It\u2019s fluffy. So fluffy that it\u2019s really hard to keep track of the stitches. I ended up having to pull out seven rows because I\u2019d been adding a bunch of stitches to each successive row without realizing it (even thought I\u2019d been counting. Math is obviously not my strong suit), and so it was going off the rails in a hurry. So I will be a lot more careful going forward, because pulling out all those rows was incredibly annoying.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nAbout That Writing Thing: \n\n\n\nIn December, my plan was to write 1,000 words per day on my current work in progress. In January, I just want to make progress. It\u2019s been slow-going, which is so different from this time last year, when I was writing up a storm. I blame the massive amount of reading I\u2019ve been doing, as the books so far have been so interesting. But I have a lot of readers who have been waiting very patiently for this next story, so I should see about getting it finished for them. And for me, because there are so many upcoming parts that I\u2019m excited to write.  \n\n\n\nSo it\u2019s back to the keyboard for me.",

                "text": "This week we spent three days in the cirque de Salazie, one of three cirques in la Reunion. As our trip took place after a little tropical storm, the first couple of days were a bit cloudy and rainy. We could see the odd mountain outline and waterfall here and there, but then the sun appeared on the final day, and wow! \n\n\n\nCette semaine nous avons pu passer trois jours dans le cirque de Salazie, un des trois cirques de la R\u00e9union. Comme notre sortie s\u2019est faite apr\u00e8s une petite temp\u00eate tropicale les deux premiers jours \u00e9taient pluvieux et nuageux. On devinait de \u00e7a et l\u00e0 des hautes montagnes, des cascades.. Puis le soleil est revenu le dernier jour, wow quelle beaut\u00e9.  \n\n\n\nTo start with, some photos of the little village of Hell-Bourg and the route which leads up into the cirque, amongst the clouds. We had a room at a g\u00eete with a little kitchen available. The first night we explored the village of Hell-Bourg, a really calm and tranquil place. There had been a water cut on the day we arrived so most of the restaurants were closed- fortunately we had brought some leftovers which had to make do for dinner! \n\n\n\nPour commencer quelques photos du petit village de Hell-Bourg et la route qui monte dans les cirques sous les nuages. Nous avions une chambre dans un g\u00eete avec une cuisine \u00e0 disposition. Le premier soir nous avons explor\u00e9 le village d\u2019Hell-Bourg qui \u00e9tait tr\u00e8s calme \u2013 il y avait une coupure d\u2019eau donc la plupart des restaurants et caf\u00e9s \u00e9taient ferm\u00e9s mais nous avions emmen\u00e9 des restes avec nous que nous avons pu manger pour le d\u00eener! \n\n\n\nPleins de cascades partout Place principale de Hell Bourg\n\n\n\nThe second day we decided to go on a hike which left from the g\u00eete and went up to the summit of Piton Maillot. You will see the view was not the best/what we were hoping to see  but was good to get the exercise all the same! \n\n\n\nLe deuxi\u00e8me jour nous avons d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de faire une randonn\u00e9e proche du g\u00eete et aller au sommet du Piton Maillot vous allez voir que la vue n\u2019\u00e9tait pas celle que l\u2019on attendait .. mais c\u2019\u00e9tait bien de faire du sport quand m\u00eame!  \n\n\n\nWhat we were supposed to see!What we saw.. Very sweaty walk to the top!A little clearing! Slippery walk back!Some nice creole house in Hell Bourg \n\n\n\nAs it was raining a lot in the afternoon we decided to rest at the g\u00eete after the hike and then head into Hell-Bourg to eat I the evening. Early to bed for an early rise the next day to make the most of the anticipated return of the sun! \n\n\n\nComme il pleuvait beaucoup l\u2019apr\u00e8s midi nous sommes rest\u00e9s au g\u00eete apr\u00e8s la randonn\u00e9e et retourn\u00e9s sur hell bourg pour manger le soir. Au lit de bonne heure pour un lever t\u00f4t le lendemain comme le soleil devait \u00eatre de retour!  \n\n\n\nThe final day was spent under a beautiful blue sky. Hence we left the best hike for this day- a walk up to the piton d\u2019Anchain. A really steep climb on the way up but worth it for the view- hopefully the photos speak for themselves! \n\n\n\nDerni\u00e8re journ\u00e9e sous le ciel bleu.. nous avions gard\u00e9 une belle randonn\u00e9e pour la derni\u00e8re journ\u00e9e du coup \u2013 l\u2019ascension du piton d\u2019Anchain une mont\u00e9e assez raide mais qui en vaut le coup une fois en haut! Les photos parlent d\u2019elles m\u00eame!  \n\n\n\nNotre objectif!Magnifique vue sur les vall\u00e9es \n\n\n\nAfter our hike we stopped off at la cascade de la voile de la mari\u00e9e and then to a little village for lunch at a family run restaurant, which offers a set menu and unlimited homemade rum punches for an ap\u00e9ro  you can see the bottles on the table! As H\u00e9l\u00e8ne was driving Tom got to sample a few more! For food, the entree was a gratin de chouchou (a local vegetable) and then fish curry and duck a la vanille for the main, followed by various home made ice creams for dessert- it was a real treat! \n\n\n\nApr\u00e8s notre randonn\u00e9e nous nous sommes arr\u00eat\u00e9s \u00e0 la Cascade de la voile de la mari\u00e9e puis dans un petit village de l\u2019est pour le repas de midi. Une famille qui fait table d\u2019h\u00f4te et propose un menu fixe avec rhum et punch maison pour l\u2019ap\u00e9ro sans limite  vous pouvez voir les bouteilles sur la table! H\u00e9l\u00e8ne roulait alors Tom a pu en go\u00fbter plus! En nourriture il y avait un gratin de chouchou (l\u00e9gume) en entree puis Cari d\u2019espadon et canard \u00e0 la vanille en plat principal et divers glaces faite maison pour le dessert! Un vrai r\u00e9gal! \n\n\n\nGratin de chouchouCari espadon et canard vanille \n\n\n\nWe returned to Saint Pierre on Friday evening. We had a relaxing day on Saturday with the market in the morning and then a service at Extravagance church in the the evening. Sunday was a beach day!  \n\n\n\nRetour sur Saint Pierre vendredi soir. Journ\u00e9e relax samedi avec le march\u00e9 et la c\u00e9l\u00e9bration \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9glise Extravagance le soir puis plage dimanche   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe continue to think of you in our prayers whether you are surrounded by snow in France or grey in the UK.. \n\n\n\nNous continuons de penser \u00e0 vous dans nos pri\u00e8res que vous soyez entour\u00e9s de neige en France o\u00f9 de grisaille au Royaume Uni..  \n\n\n\nLots of love",

                "text": "TRENDS continue similar, temperatures expected to be mild to late Tuesday then turning a lot colder; near average amounts of precipitation overall but most of that on Tuesday and Wednesday; sunshine making enough appearances to keep up the pace of this quite sunny January (will report on whether we see any record values of sunshine by end of month). FORECASTSTODAY will be partly cloudy this morning with the sun gradually disappearing behind high and then medium level clouds streaming in ahead of a complex Atlantic low, but any showery outbreaks of rain later today likely to be confined to Atlantic coastal counties and rather light there. Winds light and variable at first, becoming southeast to south 30 to 50 km/hr at least near west coast by afternoon. Highs 6 to 9 C.TONIGHT will bring partly cloudy skies, isolated showers, lows 2 to 5 C but some local frost possible in northeast.MONDAY will be mainly cloudy with a slowly increasing southeast to south wind of 40 to 60 km/hr to 50-80 km/hr later, rain spreading into parts of the southwest and northwest as two frontal boundaries form and begin to work their way east across Ireland by the overnight hours. Highs will reach about 9 C in the south and 6 C in the north.MONDAY NIGHT will be overcast with outbreaks of rain becoming a bit heavier by morning, 5 to 10 mm in this stage, winds moderate southeast to south 40 to 60 km/hr, lows 3 to 5 C north, 5 to 8 C south.TUESDAY will bring intervals of rain, gradually adding up to 15-30 mm falls, with some showery bursts and some foggy intervals also, as temperatures slowly creep up to about 11 C in the south and east, staying closer to 6 C in the north where winds will back around to the northeast, while staying south to southwest 30 to 50 km/hr across the south. By Tuesday night, intervals of heavier rain in the southeast, rain turning to sleet and snow over Ulster and this mixture slowly pushing south into the north midlands, as temperatures there fall to near 1 C.WEDNESDAY the south may remain mild for part of the day but the colder air with the sleety mix turning to wet snow will push gradually south into all of the midlands and even parts of west Munster. Some clearing may follow in Ulster where it will be cold all day. Temperatures will range from 8-10 C in Wexford, Wicklow and the inland southeast, east Cork, to near 5 C in a narrow frontal zone from about Limerick to Dublin, then 1 to 3 C further north. Winds are expected to be rather moderate from the north to northeast in the colder air mass.A deep low pressure system will form rapidly Wednesday night over the northern parts of Britain and this will end the mild spell for southeastern counties of Ireland, allowing the colder air to start moving faster around the developing storm. Over in Britain, some very heavy snowfalls may develop over higher parts of northern England and southern Scotland. Over eastern Ireland, some bands of mixed wintry showers or sleet with snow on hills appears likely as north to northwest winds increase to about 50-80 km/hr (they will be much stronger over the Irish Sea and north-central Britain). Peter O'Donnell for IWOTHURSDAY then will see bands of wintry mixed showers, snow on hills and rain/hail likely at sea level, sleet in transitional zones. These bands may be quite strong in places giving thundery showers of mixed varieties. It will be quite cold, around 3 or 4 C, but morning frosts will not be severe as lows will be -1 to +1 C. Winds northwest 50 to 80 km/hr and possibly higher in gusts in exposed locations. Wind chills of about -5 C will be perceived.FRIDAY will continue rather breezy and cold with scattered wintry showers and a bit of snow at times on hills, some bright sunny spells too, lows near -3 C and highs near +3 C.The weekend of 23rd-24th looks rather unsettled and the storm track could be right across central or southern counties of Ireland, dividing a rather mild south coast from colder central and northern counties, and producing bands of rain, sleet, and snow from south to north. Temperatures are likely to be in the 7 to 10 C range in the south, 3 to 6 C central and 1 to 3 C north. This split scenario may continue with more lows racing along in a rather active jet stream and crossing Ireland at various latitudes, so the frontal boundaries may oscillate north and south from day to day; the net result will be a rather unsettled week and there is probably some potential for another strong low to form around mid-week, details on that are out of realistic modelling range at this point.",

                "text": "I want to try something new here. I already post fictional stories, aka: smut. But I am also a writer of longer novella and novel length smut as well. Unfortunately, I haven\u2019t had much success in the self-publishing world yet, but I wanted to give it a try here (on a linked site) to see if there was interest in the story itself. The story does start of slow because the main character is still being developed, but she is ballsy at points when she is around the other main character. \n\n\n\nLeave a comment if you are interested in reading more smut! If so, I\u2019ll redirect you to where the site is that you can find it!  I\u2019d like to keep that separate from me and Daddy here that way if I need to I can tear it down and put it in book form for everyone. \n\n\n\nAnd if you like it, leave comments! They push me to go further. \n\n\n\nBlurb: \n\n\n\nAll Ms. A. wants is a quiet life with her cat Vixen. She\u2019s even turned down blind dates set up by family members. But when something simple goes wrong with her car in the middle of a snow storm, Ms. A is left to request one thing: a tow to the closest dealership. She expects professional and courteous service, but she may get more than she\u2019s bargained for. \n\n\n\nJack Doolin is the local mechanic at George\u2019s garage. He hides a secret within him that the feeling of control is becoming hard to handle. Relationships of his past has brought him that control, a satisfied nature he has always had. He\u2019s not used to taking orders, but a job is a job. And relationships are not on the horizon for him. \n\n\n\nOn a snowy night before Christmas Eve, Ms. A. finds herself face to face with a man from long ago. Jack Doolin definitely remembers who Ms. A. is when he sees her. She\u2019s perfect to prefect his control. She\u2019s at the point in her life where getting to know someone is essential to her sanity.  \n\n\n\nA new year is in the making. Will Jack convince Ms. A. he\u2019s worth what she\u2019s willing to give? \n\n\n\nwww.kinkybucketlist.wordpress.com",

                "text": "I really enjoy reading poetry aloud. Not all poems, mind you, because I don't think every poem lends itself to a good reading. Poems I think are made for reading, and which I think I do a good job of reading (pats self on back) are ones like \"Casey at the Bat,\" by Earnest Thayer, \"The Raven,\" by Edgar Allan Poe, and just about anything by Robert W. Service, the man known as \"The Bard of the Yukon.\" This tall tale of Yukon adventure is one of my particular favorites to read aloud ...\u00a0 The Cremation of Sam McGeeby Robert W. Service There are strange things done in the midnight sun\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 By the men who moil for gold;The Arctic trails have their secret tales\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 That would make your blood run cold;The Northern Lights have seen queer sights,\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 But the queerest they ever did seeWas that night on the marge of Lake Lebarge\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 I cremated Sam McGee. Now Sam McGee was from Tennessee, where the cotton blooms and blows.Why he left his home in the South to roam 'round the Pole, God only knows.He was always cold, but the land of gold seemed to hold him like a spell;Though he'd often say in his homely way that \"he'd sooner live in hell.\" On a Christmas Day we were mushing our way over the Dawson trail.Talk of your cold! through the parka's fold it stabbed like a driven nail.If our eyes we'd close, then the lashes froze till sometimes we couldn't see;It wasn't much fun, but the only one to whimper was Sam McGee. And that very night, as we lay packed tight in our robes beneath the snow,And the dogs were fed, and the stars o'erhead were dancing heel and toe,He turned to me, and \"Cap,\" says he, \"I'll cash in this trip, I guess;And if I do, I'm asking that you won't refuse my last request.\" Well, he seemed so low that I couldn't say no; then he says with a sort of moan:\"It's the curs\u00e8d cold, and it's got right hold till I'm chilled clean through to the bone.Yet 'tain't being dead\u2014it's my awful dread of the icy grave that pains;So I want you to swear that, foul or fair, you'll cremate my last remains.\" A pal's last need is a thing to heed, so I swore I would not fail;And we started on at the streak of dawn; but God! he looked ghastly pale.He crouched on the sleigh, and he raved all day of his home in Tennessee;And before nightfall a corpse was all that was left of Sam McGee. There wasn't a breath in that land of death, and I hurried, horror-driven,With a corpse half hid that I couldn't get rid, because of a promise given;It was lashed to the sleigh, and it seemed to say: \"You may tax your brawn and brains,But you promised true, and it's up to you to cremate those last remains.\" Now a promise made is a debt unpaid, and the trail has its own stern code.In the days to come, though my lips were dumb, in my heart how I cursed that load.In the long, long night, by the lone firelight, while the huskies, round in a ring,Howled out their woes to the homeless snows\u2014 O God! how I loathed the thing. And every day that quiet clay seemed to heavy and heavier grow;And on I went, though the dogs were spent and the grub was getting low;The trail was bad, and I felt half mad, but I swore I would not give in;And I'd often sing to the hateful thing, and it hearkened with a grin. Till I came to the marge of Lake Lebarge, and a derelict there lay;It was jammed in the ice, but I saw in a trice it was called the \"Alice May.\"And I looked at it, and I thought a bit, and I looked at my frozen chum;Then \"Here,\" said I, with a sudden cry, \"is my cre-ma-tor-eum.\" Some planks I tore from the cabin floor, and I lit the boiler fire;Some coal I found that was lying around, and I heaped the fuel higher;The flames just soared, and the furnace roared\u2014such a blaze you seldom see;And I burrowed a hole in the glowing coal, and I stuffed in Sam McGee. Then I made a hike, for I didn't like to hear him sizzle so;And the heavens scowled, and the huskies howled, and the wind began to blow.It was icy cold, but the hot sweat rolled down my cheeks, and I don't know why;And the greasy smoke in an inky cloak went streaking down the sky. I do not know how long in the snow I wrestled with grisly fear;But the stars came out and they danced about ere again I ventured near;I was sick with dread, but I bravely said: \"I'll just take a peep inside.I guess he's cooked, and it's time I looked\"; ... then the door I opened wide. And there sat Sam, looking cool and calm, in the heart of the furnace roar;And he wore a smile you could see a mile, and he said: \"Please close that door.It's fine in here, but I greatly fear you'll let in the cold and storm\u2014Since I left Plumtree, down in Tennessee, it's the first time I've been warm.\" There are strange things done in the midnight sun\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 By the men who moil for gold;The Arctic trails have their secret tales\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 That would make your blood run cold;The Northern Lights have seen queer sights,\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 But the queerest they ever did seeWas that night on the marge of Lake Lebarge\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 I cremated Sam McGee.  Have a good day and enjoy the rest of your weekend. Stay safe ... and warm. Bilbo",

A good Samaritan had taken care of it for them.  \n\n\n             \n                 \n                    Posted on January 17, 2021 at 6:00 a.m. \n                 \n            \n                     \n\n     \n     \n\n\n\n             \n                Antoine Trussart Press\n     \n\u201cI\u2019ve been looking for ways for some time to volunteer or do something useful for people who work in health care,\u201d said Donald Hargray, 65, on the other end of the phone.  These people do double duty, work seven days a week.  If we can help them, that\u2019s the least we can do.  \u201d  \nThe idea of \u200b\u200bclearing snow from the cars of health care workers came to him when he heard about the storm that was going to befall Quebec this weekend.  With the help of his daughter Julie, he then went on a scouting to find the parking lots of the hospital employees.  He spoke with some of them to confirm their schedules and determine the best time to get into action.  \nAt 6:54 am, equipped with a snow brush, Mr. Hargray began his snow removal operation.  He worked there for a little over two hours and cleared about 150 employee cars.  \n\n\n        \nPHOTO FROM DONALD HARGRAY\u2019S FACEBOOK PAGE \nDonald hargray \n\n\n\n\nA few employees wanted to tip me, but I refused.  A thank you and a smile, that\u2019s enough for the recognition. \n \nDonald hargray \n \nComing back completely soaked at home, the man who has worked his entire career in distribution of construction equipment decided to get back to work in the afternoon.  From 2:30 p.m. to 5:15 p.m., this time with a small snowblower, he helped around 30 employees get their cars out of the snow, which was much heavier than in the morning.  \nHe would have liked to go back there for the evening shift, but the curfew prevented him from doing so.  He also recognizes that his two snow removal sessions have tired him a little.  \n\u201cI saw a lot of vehicles that weren\u2019t moved during the day, so it\u2019s people who are doing doubles,\u201d he explains.  They would have appreciated that.  \u201d  \nDonald Hargray insists that he did not take this action to make people talk about him.  \u201cThe reason why I agree to [parler \u00e0 un journaliste], that\u2019s if it can give others ideas to do such a simple gesture, he explains.  It doesn\u2019t cost anything, it\u2019s easy and it\u2019s much appreciated.  \u201d  \n \n \n  \nwww.lapresse.ca \nThe post A Good Samaritan clears 150 cars at the Saint-J\u00e9r\u00f4me hospital appeared first on The Canadian .",

                "text": "Silence. \n\n\n\nI\u2019m awake very early. \n\n\n\nIn the half light of the morning, the world is quiet and I\u2019m watching the snow fall outside my window. \u00a0I\u2019m sipping Earl Grey tea and breathing in the calm and peace. Soothing, mesmerising snowflakes drift past the window. \n\n\n\nThe garden is deep in snow and the footprints of yesterday\u2019s games are slowly vanishing under the fresh snowfall. \u00a0We made a Snow Beast, Lumi. He stands guard by the swing, a silent sentinel in our white world. Inside, it\u2019s just me and the little one, snuggled up together in a soft, furry blanket. \n\n\n\nThis is the best life \n\n\n\nThis is how it is now. The peace, the quiet and the time to take it all in. \u00a0 \n\n\n\nI\u2019ve left behind the crazy, noisy \u2018look at me!\u2019 life of being with a narcissist and exchanged it for the sanity and warmth of the \u2018how are you?\u2019 life of healthy people. \n\n\n\nYesterday, walking through the snow, and no longer walking on eggshells, I was aware of my creative spirit returning. \u00a0I naturally have a curious mind that sees the beauty around me; The skaters on a frozen river, a Siberian Jay fluffed up against the cold, icicles hanging from the church doorway. I have the time now to really look at my world. \u00a0Life is so short; I want to inhale it while I can. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis has been the secret of my healing. At first, I had to force myself to meditate and to stop ruminating on the past. I had to actively practice mindfulness and remind myself to go and look at the sunset or the moon. I had to work on my self-esteem, accepting that my worth cannot be measured by how attractive I might be, how young I am or how funny I was. I am me; a unique combination of DNA going back to the start of humankind and a product of all the amazing, terrifying, breath-taking moments of my life. Every single one of us is special, but no more than anyone else. \u00a0 \n\n\n\nI\u2019m told narcissists miss out on this. They are so hollow and empty that they cannot truly experience the wonder of standing at the foot of a mountain or sailing through a frozen sea. To fully experience awe, one must accept that we are relatively unimportant in the scheme of things. Our experiences will one day be lost \u2018like tears in rain.\u2019 \u00a0\u00a0If every waking moment is about seeking attention to numb their fractured soul, then where is the time to reflect and heal that brokenness. \u00a0If all their energy is spent on putting people down to feel better about themselves, then they have no energy to create long lasting connections with others. They miss the joy of listening to their children, of laughing with close friends and of love making with someone you truly connect with. This is such a good world and I am so glad I have the gift of being able to appreciate it. \u00a0 \n\n\n\nThe sun is breaking through the snow clouds now and the thermometer says its sixteen degrees below zero outside.  \n\n\n\nThe Norwegians say, \u201cThere is no such thing as bad weather, just the wrong clothes\u201d. \u00a0This  suggests we can adjust to cope with our circumstances by putting on the right clothes, or right mental attitude. However, I\u2019ve been caught in a cyclone and I am going to say that that was bad weather. There were no clothes to protect me from that meteorological madness. I also know that when a blizzard comes in and you are blinded by snow then nothing you are wearing can save you. This is a relationship with a narcissist, they are bad weather and there is nothing you can wear to protect you. \u00a0Get out of the storm. \n\n\n\nI got out. My life is no longer a tempest. It is rich and full of experiences; the aroma of delicious meals and the taste of fine wines; the joy of children\u2019s giggles and the raucous laughter of friends. It is a life of sticky hands, warm hearts and ten pairs of snow boots in the hall. \u00a0Only the children shout \u201clook at me!\u201d \n\n\n\nSo here we are, wrapped in a blanket and safe from the icy wind outside. \n\n\n\nI\u2019ll make some more tea and light the fire \n\n\n\nThis is the best life \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDo you need to leave? \n\n\n\nAbuse damages us, whether it is emotional, physical, financial or sexual, it undermines our self worth and puts our mental and physical well being at risk. If you need to leave an abusive or manipulative relationship you can get help. \n\n\n\nUK National Domestic Abuse Helpline \u2013 0808 2000 247Respect \u2013 Men\u2019s Advice Line, for male domestic abuse survivors \u2013 0808 801 0327 Galop \u2013 National LGBT+ Domestic Abuse Helpline \u2013 0800 999 5428 Samaritans (24/7 service) \u2013 116 123 Women\u2019s Aid can support women to leave safely",

                "text": "Title:  Luka \nAuthor: Dianne Hartsock \nPublisher:  NineStar Press \nRelease Date: 01/11/2021 \nHeat Level: 3 \u2013 Some Sex \nPairing: Male/Male \nLength: 72200 \nGenre: Paranormal, LGBTQIA+, age gap, witches, sorcerers, fae, magic, second chances \nAdd to Goodreads\n \nDescription\nLuka makes a desperate wish and the earth shifts to his will. Regretting it immediately, he tries to undue the sorcery, but it is too late. He asked for hope, and to his horror, all the hope in the world is given into his keeping. He desires nothing more than to return this gift to the world. \nAethan wants to get his hands on the Well of Hope in Luka\u2019s keeping. If he can ransom out hope to others at his whim, the world will be at his feet. Where it belongs. \nWith the aid of his lover, Rhys, Luka stays one step ahead of Aethan. But Rhys has his own enemy in Aethan, his estranged father. \nRescued by Luka, his sweet, gentle witch, Rhys now stands with him against Aethan. They have vowed to return the Well of Hope to the earth despite all odds, or die trying. For what is life worth, for anyone, without hope? \nExcerpt\nLuka \nDianne Hartsock \u00a9 2020 \nAll Rights Reserved \nLuka settled cross-legged on the hearth with a murmured word of gratitude to the fire as its warmth surrounded him. Keeping a veiled eye on the woodpile, he crumbled a crust of bread and honey onto the stones. The animals had grown skittish of late, and he missed their company on his long tramps through the forest. The cabin had grown lonely without Rhys\u2019s vibrant presence. \nThe thoughts of his lover sent his gaze to the small stack of books he kept close at hand to leaf through during the long empty nights. He\u2019d rescued the young man from a brutish existence at the hands of a madman, and the stories were all that would ease his frantic, tortured mind. Rhys would sit close to Luka while Luka read the heroic tales until his head would nod, and he\u2019d slump into Luka\u2019s arms, a warm, living presence in his solitary life. \nLuka raised his head, attentive. Winter gathered outside the latched door, wind howling through the trees, sending their limbs scratching along the roof. A shiver traveled up his spine. Something darker than the storm was coming. \nThe fire snapped in a shower of sparks, recalling his attention. He drew a small bundle of twigs from a pocket, cupped it in his worn, nut-brown hands, and breathed in the scent of juniper and sage. Chanting the words his mother had taught him long ago, he tossed the clump into the flames. A tendril of smoke rose, twirled in lazy circles in the air and brushed against his face. \nHe breathed deeply, holding in his lungs the heady smoke of the sage and grasses he\u2019d gathered by the stream last autumn. His thoughts cleared. He saw everything! Snow whipped through the darkness between the trees, carried on the fierce wind. His beloved animals huddled in the scrub brush for safety and warmth. The village beyond the forest barred its doors, fires lit, safe inside while the storm raged. \nHis thoughts soared, bursting into the moonlit landscape above the clouds. Laughing aloud, his spirit flew in wonder, heart aching at the beauty of the night. But something tugged at his heart, his name shouted on the wind. He blinked at tears, bringing the fire back into focus, the cabin solid around him. Night pressed on the shuttered windows. Something was in the night\u2026 \nLuka\u2019s heart leaped. He comes! A soft cry of joy escaped him, and he rose in one fluid motion to his feet. He\u2019d sent Rhys away to find love elsewhere than in the arms of a lonely witch, and yet he came, daring the storm. \n\u201cCome to me,\u201d he urged the solitary figure in his mind\u2019s eye, struggling up the path to reach him. A tremor seized him. Long years of bartering his herbs and potions to the villagers had passed while he waited with hope and dread for Rhys\u2019s return, darkness at his heels. \nHe crossed the wooden floor of the cabin, logs he\u2019d hewn and planed himself, lighting the candles with a word as he passed, filling the room with light. Luka paused at the door, hand hesitant on the latch. He had enemies beyond this safe threshold. What if Rhys had gone to them in his bitterness and returned now for revenge? Luka closed his eyes, seeing again the pain on Rhys\u2019s youthful face, the confusion in his eyes when Luka told him to go, and closed the door on his anguished pleas. \nA rap on the door sent his pulse racing. Love and doubt warred inside him, but he had to know, see the truth of it. He opened the door a crack; icy wind whistled in. A figure stood on his step, the heavy cloak clutched against the cold obscuring his features. Who was this? He swung the door wider. The energy was all wrong. But Luka would welcome him in whatever guise he wore. \nHe opened his hungry arms, but Rhys shook his head and looked up, candlelight spilling on his pale face, grown older. \u201cYou sent me away\u2014brokenhearted.\u201d Rhys\u2019s voice was deeper than he remembered. \u201cIf I cross this threshold, I won\u2019t leave again. Be very sure.\u201d \nLuka trembled, searching the beloved features, and mourned the sweet innocence that was missing. Snow sifted through the trees adding to the weight on Rhys\u2019s shoulders, and Luka swallowed his doubts. \u201cCome inside.\u201d He tugged on Rhys\u2019s sleeve, unable to mask his eagerness. His heart stumbled, then leaped, seeing a flash of elation in Rhys\u2019s eyes. \nRhys stepped into the cottage in a flurry of cold air and snow, and Luka hastily closed and latched the door behind him. He turned, and his lips parted in a startled gasp. Rhys had removed his cloak, snow already melting on the warm floor. His golden hair fell loosely to his shoulders, and his body filled out the tunic and trousers he wore in a way it hadn\u2019t five years ago. He had grown into a handsome man, the fine wool of his clothing attesting he\u2019d done well in the village. \nSuddenly conscious of his frayed sleeves and ink-stained fingers, the silver now threading his dark braid of hair, Luka glanced away. His gaze fell on the books and parchment littering every surface, candle wax spilled on the tabletops. A thick layer of dust covered the bookshelves, except for the volumes he used for reference. He chewed a lip, troubled. \n\u201cCome to the fire,\u201d he offered, taking Rhys\u2019s cloak to hang on a peg. \u201cThere\u2019s a stew simmering on the hearth.\u201d \nRhys touched his shoulder, halting him. \u201cA moment. I\u2019ve come to warn you. Your old enemy\u2014\u201d \n\u201cIs coming. This I know. We\u2019ll talk of it later. Please, come to the fire. You must be cold.\u201d \n\u201cLuka.\u201d \nLuka swiveled sharply at the command in Rhys\u2019s voice, a thrill rushing through him. So much courage from his once timid lover. Was this the same man he\u2019d rescued? The young lad of seventeen years, chained and beaten in a dank cellar? Rhys wouldn\u2019t speak of his parents back then, saying only he\u2019d lived on the charity of others\u2014until he\u2019d been snared, captive to a cruel man\u2019s dark appetites. \nRhys\u2019s soul had cried out in anguish from his prison, finding Luka\u2019s heart, drawing him deep into the forest to the monster\u2019s isolated hut. Luka had eluded the dark sorcerer, freeing the lad and taking him into his home. And later, into his bed, a moth to Rhys\u2019s bright flame, his heart opened for the first time in uncounted years to love and promise. \nPurchase\nNineStar Press | Books2Read\n \nMeet the Author \n\nDianne is the author of paranormal/suspense, fantasy adventure, m/m romance, the occasional thriller, and anything else that comes to mind.

                "text": "The winter in Lockdownia continues hard, and with no sign of relief in sight. The sun has not shone on our land for almost two months. There is nothing more I can do for my people in Quarantinia without the protective tincture which is due to be brought by ship from the Outlands. With the storm conjured up by Brexicorax still raging, alas! the rebel army cannot yet set sail. For this reason, I have decided to journey to my Summer Palace in the Southlands to await the arrival of the distant rebel fleet. \n\n\n\nPreparing for the Journey\n\n\n\nAs we load up the Royal Carriage with what meagre possessions remain to us, I feel a gnawing sense of guilt, as if I am abandoning my subjects in Quarantinia to a dismal fate beneath the sombre skies. But in truth I can do nothing more for them without the protective tincture, and in addition I have subjects throughout Lockdownia whose spirits might be lifted by the sight of their unconquered Queen-in-Exile.  \n\n\n\nIt is to be a perilous journey: more perilous yet than my visit to Father Winter in the snow-covered Highlands. Furthermore, I cannot leave my family behind. For certain, if Koronin finds out that we are leaving, he will try everything in his power to prevent us. In every town, I will be able to muster further forces for the rebel army and he knows this: he knows my power, though he holds my Castle and subjects in thrall. \n\n\n\nWe shall also be at risk from highway bandits, who would not hesitate to rob a queen of her remaining gold to sell to greedy merchants in Balkania, nor would think twice about taking our lives. For this reason, we carry knives of our own for protection, and I am not without magic, nor the skill or nerve required to use it. \n\n\n\nA goodbye\n\n\n\nSo, with all of our possessions loaded, and our meagre residence left bare and empty, dust blowing up miniature storms across the flagstone floor, we say a fond and eager goodbye to the region of Quarantinia. Some brave townspeople take to the streets to wave us off. I promise I will return forthwith to free them from the bondage of Koronin\u2019s evil spell.  \n\n\n\nFond, for this is my home, and seat of my rightful royal throne. Eager, for my heart longs to glimpse the sun once more. The children, who have more than tired of their winter confines, bustle eagerly into the carriage and can scarce sit still, so great is their excitement. I have misgivings about subjecting them to such a perilous journey, but something tells me that to leave them behind here would be far, far worse. \n\n\n\nClouds gather, threatening a blizzard, and we must make haste before the storm. I leave you with an image of the Southlands, from whence I shall write you next, should the fates and time allow it. \n\n\n\nWish me luck on this long journey as I remain ever \n\n\n\nYour Queen and dear friend from another time. \n\n\n\nRead the story so far in the Chronicles of Lockdownia archives. \nThe post Chronicles of Lockdownia #6: The Southlands appeared first on Experiments in Fiction.",

                "text": "Severe gales, giant swells, rain and snow are about to shock the country as two Southern Ocean storms track very near to New Zealand.\u00a0 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Caitlin Ellis \n\n\n\nThe first storm will trail past on Sunday followed by a larger one moving through on Wednesday. \n\n\n\nBoth storms bring with them a dramatic temperature drop with daytime highs failing to reach double digits in some places. \n\n\n\nNew Zealand often experiences dramatic cold changes during summer, but according to WeatherWatch, this one will be more \u201cpotent\u201d than most and comes with severe gales. \n\n\n\nIt warns everyone travelling in remote areas to take caution as this is \u201cnot the usual cool change in summer\u201d. \n\n\n\n\u201cThis upcoming weather is being generated by two powerful storms in the Southern Ocean and severe weather is highly likely.\u201d \n\n\n\nTo top it all off the West Coast of the South Island will see some massive swells rolling in by mid-week, expected to reach 12 metres. \n\n\n\nSnow and rain \n\n\n\nSnow flurries are expected on the Southern Alps as early as Saturday night and will see heavier snowfall as the second low moves in midweek. \n\n\n\nMetService has heavy rain warnings in place for Nelson, Richmond Ranges, Dunedin, Clutha, South of Riversdale, and Fiordland until Sunday night, as well as a heavy rain warning for the Westland Ranges in place until 1am Monday. \n\n\n\nNear-freezing temperatures \n\n\n\nWindchill is set to get down to freezing in northern Southland, according to RuralWeather. Dunedin will experience an air temp of 10C on Wednesday that will feel more like a chilly 6C. \n\n\n\nWeatherWatch is warning those in Fiordland National Park will feel the brunt of the chill, the daytime high for Milford Sound currently sitting at just 5C for Wednesday but due to windchill will feel more like 1C. \n\n\n\n\u201cTrampers, campers and hikers in these areas will need winter gear and be prepared for blizzards higher up in the ranges,\u201d says WeatherWatch head forecaster Philip Duncan. \n\n\n\n\u201cIf this was happening in August we\u2019d be looking at a significant sea-level snow event for the lower South Island. A stormier than usual Southern Ocean since spring 2020 is the driver of this much colder-than-usual change for parts of New Zealand.\u201d \n\n\n\nWhile all Kiwis will be facing a frosty summer temperature drop, the top half of the North Island is set to be less exposed. \n\n\n\n\u201cAuckland will drop down to maybe 19C as the daytime high on Wednesday but it will be the westerly winds that may be of more notice with at least three or four windy days in a row on the way with gusts to gale force at times,\u201d says Duncan. \n\n\n\nWellington is expected to be in the \u201cthick\u201d of it, with four days of possible gale-force winds starting Sunday. Tie-down your trampolines for the expected peak on Tuesday where damaging gusts could reach over 120km. \n\n\n\nHigh winds will also impact eastern areas such as the Coromandel Peninsula, where windy westerlies may near gale force for a time.\u00a0 \n\n\n\nThunderstorms are possible in the west, which will also see gale-force winds as air funnels up through the Cook Strait Area. \n\n\n\nChristchurch will be able to escape the freezing temperatures but not the wind, with gusts reaching up to 100km. \n\n\n\nOriginally published at News hub \nThe post Weather: Severe Gales, Blizzards, 12-Metre Waves As Two Southern Ocean Storms Blast New Zealand appeared first on Technology Times.",
